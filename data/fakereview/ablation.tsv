The car is painted and looks real, with the instructions included.  There is a button that activates a two-way radio.  There is also a plastic "turn" button that activates a speaker.  It does not work on the car.  This car is very loud.  It is very difficult to control the car, especially when you have a high speed car like the Ferrari or the Ferrari Supercar.  The buttons on the car are very loud, and the car is not very stable.  You have to constantly pull the button to turn it, which is very annoying.  The car is very noisy.  The buttons on the car do not stay in place, and the car is very unstable.  It does not work on the car at all.  There is a 3-way radio, but it is not active at all.My daughter is very happy with this toy.  It is very durable.  It does not break easily.  My daughter is 4 and has had many of her favorite cars for many years.  This toy is very durable, and very easy to use.  I would recommend this toy for any child who loves cars and trains.My son is into all things science and he loves the little sets.  He has a lot of fun with them and loves to play with the dragon and the mushroom.  The magnets are nice and he loves playing with the dragon.

I have just purchased my second of these mixers, as my daughter "burned out" the first making cookies (snickerdoodles - not that heavy).  That I am buying another is a reflection of what I like about it - it is very effective in light tasks, from whipping cream to mixing cakes.  It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.  However it is not meant for heavy tasks - for that I have a KitchenAid stand mixer (of course).  So I gave it a 4 only because it is not really powerful. 	 0
My 2yr old received this on her 1st b-day and she loved it. This was her first experience with using crayons in the tub, and it was a treat while it lasted. My biggest complaint is that the crayons "shorten" rather quickly so...as they shorten, the harder it is for little and big fingers to get out. It used to frustrate her so I stopped letting her use them. Now she uses the Dorothy fish bowl as a fun water strainer. Elmo is great too, he dries quickly, overnite and he is good to use as a learning tool for the young bather. 	 0
This PWOW ErgoFit earbuds are very good for its price. It's very comfortable and have great sound quailty. One of the feature that I like about this earbuds because it block out background noise and wire cord are well made. For the price, I love it has built-in microphone to answer your calls, a switch to toggle between iPhone or android and a sliding volume control. It can only allow you to adjust music volume only so in order to skip it to next song which you need to do on your phone. Also, they don't hurt my ears after a long-wear. Earbuds and headphones that is more bulky tend to hurt my ears because they fit too full in my ears but this earbuds doesn't hurt my ears at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pair of earbuds that are really cheap with good sound quailty.Pros:* Ultra-soft ErogoFit in-ear earbuds* Multipurpose Remote: Volume control, music switching, hands-free call, open Siri in iPhones* Built-in microphone and answer key: allowing hands-free callingCons:* None so far.

The description on this erroneously states that it will work for .45 ACP.  It doesn't.  If you try to load .45 ACP with this the cases constantly become hung up when ejecting into the bin.  Instead you need the #45 shell plate.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this plate for rifle calibers, but I don't load rifle cartridges on a progressive so its pretty much of no use to me. 	 0

Who knew that our kids would want to be retro and listen to old vinyl records?  When we bought our daughter a record player, we realized she couldn't listen to our old 45 speed vinyl singles on it.  This little adaptor did the trick.  This makes more sense than those individual adaptors that have to be inserted into each individual disc.  With this, you just put it on the player and you can plan one 45 after another, then remove it to listen to albums. 	 0
This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product. 	 0

So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.UPDATEI have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100 	 0

I bought this watch for my wife and she loves it.  She wears it almost every day.  She loves the color and the band.  The band is a nice quality and the clasp is well made.  She's a bit disappointed.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits him so well.  He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time.  I love the material and the look of it.  The leather is really nice and comfortable.  I just wish it had a more stretchy feel.  The straps are not too long, which makes it easier to pull on.  The leather is soft and looks great.  I'm a size 10 and it's a little tight around the ankles but that's normal with most shoes.  The strap is pretty stiff, but not too tight.  It's a nice looking shoe, but I 	 1

I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.Only thing that could make this better for me.....cup holders!!!Update: Dec 2011 After nearly 6 years of use, the cart had it's last summer.  The wheels finally fell off.  We reattached them a couple times, but now they keep falling off.  I WILL be getting another. 	 0

I realy liked the gun, nice and smooth work but it just broke. Description says it will not brake within a year and it did not but it broke one year and two months later after purchase. The worst part of it, is that I can NOT get parts for this gun anywhere. The "driver" which broke is easy to replace if you can get it, but you can not, so gun goes to the garbage and I will come back to the Hitachi which parts you can get easly and repair by yourself. 	 0

I am a Dominant is a sweet, sweet, romantic story about a happy, happy, happy couple. The story is told from both the POV of Torey and Danielle's point of view. It was a very sweet story.

**I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This book was awesome. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance. The characters were well developed and the storyline was full of action. I liked the fact that it was free, and it was a free book. I just didn't care for it as much as I did the other books I read. Overall, I liked this book. I really enjoyed this book, it was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a short story. I read it in one sitting. I'll be looking for more by this author. I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is determined to be happy. She doesn't want to go back to her past and finds the man who she loves. This story is a great read. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The romance is great, and the story is a great follow up. This is the second book in the Standalone Series. I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review. I am a fan of the author's writing and this one had me hooked. I am looking forward to the next book. I am not sure if this is a continuation of the series, but I am not sure it will be a standalone, so I am not sure I will read the next book. It is a great read. 	 1

The Dentastix are great. My dogs love them and I buy them when I can find the right price.Although my dogs are large (70 and 78 pounds), they do not care for large treats. Therefore, I buy the medium-sized ones and they are much happier with these. They like the original flavor, although I've tried other flavors and they like them also.Amazon's price ($54.95 for 100 sticks) is more expensive than other retailers. So, shop around. 	 0

I was a little apprehensive about this one, due to the the comments here. I took the plunge after confirming that it would work with my HP 6540 printer. Setup was easy - but since I run WPA on the wireless side, hooking up to the wired side was a necessity for configuring it (of course - how would it know your key?)The quick start guide was passable, I ended up using the PDF version of the full manual instead.It does run very hot - but since everyone says this about them, I'm sure it's "normal". I'm currently trying to decide whether I will leave it on all the time, or keep the printer and printserver powered off until I need to print. 	 0

I bought two of these and both work great.  I will keep them in the house and use them when we go to bed.  The first one was a little too big for my cat and it didn't fit.

To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying "I'll just have a few". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process. Read this guy; if you like raunchy, sexy, a little crazy and a fabulous story. 	 0
When a murder-mystery fiction involving a serial killer with a serial killer history becomes one of the top-grossing thrillers in the world, I can't help but think this is a great book to read.  It's a murder mystery that can be solved with only a few clues.  It's a great read, and I recommend it highly.I was so happy to see the first book in this series! I love the characters and their story line! It's very refreshing to have a new author get to read the series. I liked the first one so much! I read the second one after reading the first one. I was a little disappointed with the first one. I'll be reading the third one to see what happens next. I think the fourth one is awesome! I love the way the books move the story forward.

4. 5 stars. Fun, funny read. Miller is Vi's (from Pucked) brother from Pucked. Sunny is Alex's sister. They met in Pucked and in Pucked Up, we find Miller and Sunny trying to get their relationship on track. Miller is a reformed manwhore. He wants to be a better guy and dedicated to Sunny but his past gets in the way. Sunny is the cutest granola-y girl. You definitely pull for them from the start, you want to see these two together.

I needed to know when it would work with my phone.  I did not have to go to a local store to find it, but I figured if I wanted to take it to the store, I would.  I am a bit skeptical about the reason why some people would not buy this product.  I have the phone and I can use the phone with the same charger.  I just can't get it to work with the phone.  I will update this review if I find out more.Update:  I purchased this product for my wife who is a web developer.  She has a MacBook Air and was able to use it with the web.

Wow, didn't see that coming! Great book as  pages turned in anticipation. Crouch writes like no other. He can be soft and seem predictable until you turn to the next few pages and hard core horror jumps out at you from no where. After reading many of his novels that has kept me trembling in horror through many a night, Luther Kite series come to mind with many others. Ok, as true horror fan, maybe I am a bit delightfully scarred from reading them. Snowbound is one of his softer sides in no way disappointing never-the-less. I enjoyed the pace he set moving the storyline to the finish and what a finish it is. This is a must read. 	 0

Most silicone potholders are too small to be used as a pressure cooker.The handle has a suction cup that is very flexible.  The handle is not flexible at all.

First, I must say... with this product, the dogs love it.  When I put it on their coats, they are all calm, relaxed and happy!  This product is very well made and the dogs look great in it.  The size is perfect and the dog does not have a problem with it.Also, I have had to use a second bag to store the bag for my dogs.  I put the bags on their coats and it took about 30 seconds for them to get used to it.  The bags are really nice and easy to put together.  I highly recommend it.Overall, I was very pleased with this 	 1
I use lens hoods to improve contrast, as well as to provide a bit of physical protection for the lens, since I don't believe in adding a "protective" filter to the front of a lens, except where there is a chemical or severe debris risk. That said, this one is pretty small, so not much protection physically, but if it helps increase contrast, then it will be worth the investment. 	 0

Loved it!  I enjoyed all the references to the hokey celebrity xmas specials of my youth.  And the nod to Pee Wee Herman's xmas special - a classic.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  ("And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ." to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)  And did I catch a Kirk/Spock moment there through the cabin door?  I got goosebumps.Can't recommend it highly enough.  If you have a bent sense of humor and love pop culture this show will push your buttons.p.s.  I can't tell if Toby Keith is in on the joke or not.  It reminds me of Warhol's Tomato Soup can.  Soup.

4.5 StarsThis was my first time reading the author's work and it was my first time reading the series.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This was a good book and I enjoyed it a lot.  I would recommend this book to others.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I liked this book so much I could not put it down! I love the characters and the story line! It's very realistic! I want to see more of the old school soldiers, but I'm not sure I want to read a story about a man who is so broken and confused that he doesn't know who to trust or care for. I love the fact that the author does not give the reader a definitive answer for what caused her to be so broken and confused. I look forward to reading more books by this author!I received this book as a gift from the author.This is the first book I've read by this author and I'm glad I did.  She's done it again.  The story line is fast paced and flows very well.  I loved the characters and the story line.  It's not a short story but it's a great read.  I would recommend this book to everyone.I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and I really enjoyed the characters.  It was sweet and sexy.  I love the way the story flowed and the way the story progressed.  It was a fun read.  	 1

I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

Eve Fortescue is back in Bellefleur, Lousisanna in hopes to convince Brent Bellefleur, groom-to-be, that she is the one he should marry ~ not Honey Moreau.  As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.Review Copy Courtesy of: The publisher, at no cost in exchange for an honest review. 	 0

Several years ago, I read a book by an author called "The Grapes of Wrath" and thought that it had a lot of information and details that I didn't know. The book was well researched and in good condition. I read it several times and it has been a long time since I have read the book. I have never heard of a book like this. I have had to read it several times and it has been a long time since I have read it. I am now going to start reading it again. I have never heard of a book like this before.

I loved the way the book portrayed the lives of these two people and how they changed in the past and present. I have read many books by James Patterson. 	 1

So I was thinking that this film would be super hookey and way too contrived, but it was great!  The story just takes you in and doesn't let go until the end.  You will be cheering right along with them!  Yes, you will become that attached to the outcome of the competition!  The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that the main characters (the students) are just okay as actors.  The ROTC guy was the best.  George Lopez, Jamie Curtis, and Marissa Tomei were all great in their roles, with Jamie Curtis being the most outstanding of the three. 	 0
This book will haunt you. Truth is stranger than fiction.

When we got our new puppy, we were told "she's a chewer" and given some rawhide chews for her. Those did NOT work. Our vet suggested we try a Kong toy for her, because they're made to withstand even the most heavy chewers. When we first got it, our girl showed little interest...but I read online that someone got their dog "into" the Kong by filling it with peanut butter and freezing it. I did this, and our little girl spent HOURS trying to get all of the peanut butter out.I would say that the Kong is a great chew toy, but not on it's own. None of my dogs find it interesting in the least unless it's filled with something.  That being said, if you're willing to put something yummy inside of it, then you have yourself a winner most likely. We've tried peanut butter, pureed pumpkin, the paste they sell,  a combination of  peanut butter and carrots, and all has been successful. It takes a bit of effort, but our Kong is still going strong, and hasn't been destroyed yet! 	 0

I usually buy Ravensburger puzzles, but I liked this vintage seed packets picture so decided to give White Mountain a try seeing as it had good reviews. Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces. 	 0
This is a perfect little swing. We hung it up in our front yard in a little tree and my 6 and 4 year old have not left it alone. I have not seen one flaw with this swing.

I've used Royal Canin foods, both prescription and regular retail, for years. All of our pets have been fed Royal Canin products and seem really healthy with healthy coats and excellent body function.

Purchased twice.  The first lasted almost a year with regular use.  I would keep it my pocket at work to keep track of breaks.  The second one lasted only a month or so.  The malfunction seems to be that, with regular use, the battery no longer makes proper contact resulting in a blank screen or random resets in the clock function.

I used to work for an electrical supply house that only sold TCP LED bulbs and I used to stand by the product. However, after buying these, I may switch brands. I've only used 3 of the bulbs and already I've had 1 die off within 2 months of usage in my bedroom light. A standard light bulb would've lasted longer and wouldn't have cost anywhere near what I paid for these. I'm very disappointed and will consider other brands in the future. 	 0

The film is represents the characters and concepts of the book fairly well. The protagonist, Lily, seems unable to make rational decisions, though she is reasonably intelligent. She's hampered by the conventions of her time as well as the shallow ideas inculcated by her mother. She's generally valued for her beauty and uses that as currency for entre into the level of society she's been taught to value. Unfortunately, at the point of success (marriage to a wealthy man), she undermines herself by doing something stupid. She never quite understands her own motives and learns introspection and self-realization too late. 	 0

DO NOT leave home without this wine opener!! Seriously, why all the bad reviews? Maybe quality was an issue when they first came out, but it's 2018 and I've had mine for 3 years now. I bought it specifically because it has NO BLADE, thus it is TSA-approved! I can take it anywhere! I constantly find myself in the situation of having a bottle of wine and no opener. Sometimes when traveling across the country, sometimes just traveling across town. Instead of buying a corkscrew in another state only to have it thrown away when I get to the airport, I keep this blade-free gem in my purse at all times. I have LITERALLY gotten high-fives from TSA agents who stare in amazement that there is indeed NO BLADE on this baby! I love it so much that I'm getting one for my mother and mother-in-law to keep in their purses. If you travel often and love wine, get this corkscrew ASAP. 	 0

Love this case, fits my MacBook Pro 15 Retina perfectly. I tried the Speck and had problems with the tabs coming off. This case doesn't scratch your MacBook and was designed to protect it. Yeah, it gets minor scratches on the case like it was designed to do but the real reason I bought it was to Protect my 3k investment. Also, it wraps the edges very nicely and fits with a carbon skin installed on it. A+ for a well designed and very reasonably priced shell. 	 0

I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter. 	 0

Great lights. However the 18650 batteries WILL eventually lose the ability to hold a charge. I just replaced one after 3 years. Simple Phillips head screws and I like replacing with  EBL batteries. Much better than those cheap blue ones that come with it.Update:just ordered four more to take care of more places that get dark. 4 for me and 4 for my new neighbor that doesn't know how to use the internet (she's 81) but wanted to get lights like mine. When I told her the price she was delighted (pun intended lol)UPDATE: I have apparently the some of the  older models (bought 2 years ago) These NEW ones don't do what the old ones did. They only have "on" and "dim to bright" modes. My old ones had THREE settings. ON...dim to bright when motion is detected AND totally off and then bright when motion is detected. In the WINTER I need the last mode. I HATE when companies "improve" things. Probably due to the fact that people couldn't figure out how to use a bent paper clip to change the modes. 	 0

I have grandsons 5 and 7. 5 is average height. 7 a little tall for age. We are taking then on a long train ride from NY to San Diego with stops in Grand Canyon, lots of kid things in San Diego. I am a travel nanny by trade so being prepared is my motto!  They needed backpacks just big enough to carry a couple bottles of water an a good supply of snacks for hikes and carry their Fire for train rides. I thought this was going to be too small at first. But I easily put a bottle on outside and inside plus my Fire and plenty of room for snacks, some playing cards etc. The back has a small padded feature. I wondered if straps would fit 7 yr old and I can adjust to even fit me! Best part? So light even with stuff that even my 5 year old won't complain! The stretchy from cords can even carry a small stuffed animal for sleep later.I will do an update after trip (if still alive) and give feedbacks. With kids, go as small as you can and still do the job!Update: These were perfect and now after trip they use it on long bike rides with dad.I liked it so much that I got one for myself for my Scotland trip in Oct. I can not do heavy backpacks and when out being a tourist, purses are a bother. Great for plane as will hold a travel blanket, fire and tablet, phone and cords plus a bottle.Very useful and inexpensive! 	 0

Th is a very good stylus, the only thing I wish it had is a little better grip. I had to use a clamp to get the stylus to stay in my hand. I still use it a lot, but it's not very good. The grip is not a big deal for me, it just feels a little too loose. 	 1

Well actually my husband loves this. The only problem is that it's a little hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should work fine. But it's a little difficult to put on. If you are going to use it you should have a rubber band to tighten the screw to keep it from getting stuck. If you are looking for a solid grip then this will work fine.

This product could have easily been an improvement. The two dogs love this food. They are a very healthy breed and I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great cat litter.

I have never read anything about this author before, and I have to say that I was delighted with his work. I enjoyed this novel a lot, and it gave me a good glimpse of what life can be for a well-off older couple in modern Israel. How they cope with everyday life, family issues, death, mourning, separation, etc. It was a slow read, but not boring at all. It all happens during an eight-day holiday; Hanukkah. And with the lighting of each candle we get to see how the past and present of this family unfolds.However, I would have liked to know more of some characters, like the couple's son and daughter, for example, or the grandfather, but you still get some hints as to what their lives are like. You can pretty much put the puzzle together, or develop the characters in your mind any way you want. After all the story revolves around the married couple, Daniela and Amotz, who by the way make a nice couple. The brother in law, Yirmiyahu, is so mysterious and obscure, that you get hooked with him trying to unravel his mind and feelings. Africa seems then the appropriate setting for this man, and all that surrounds him enhances the mystery. And he does spice the book a lot. Overall, I think it's a good read, and an enjoyable book. 	 0

I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy. 	 0

Work great and bright. These are not ballast compatible even though the box says they are. I called the company and reached someone immediately who confirmed that you need to remove/bypass the ballast. Not a problem as removing the lamp ballast and rewiring the light was a simple, quick and easy job. Not having a ballast means one less thing to fail. Another plus is that these LED lights do not get warm like the fluorescent did. I used these LED lights to replace fluorescent lights in under cabinet fixtures which would get warm which also warmed the cabinets. 	 0

Great laces, I usually go for an XL. These fit perfect. They are warm and stretchy so I don't sweat, but they're light and not so thin that I'm concerned they won't last long. I wear them for long walks and some beach trips. They don't come with a pouch so I can carry my items on my briefcase. They're cute though, and I love the way they fit. I'm 5'4" and it's a little big for me, but I've got a medium chest so I think it's a good length. 	 1

Shop Fox D3030 16-Inch Full Ext Drawer Slide 100-Pound Capacity Side Mount, Pair ReviewI bought 2 pair of the Shop Fox slides to use for a custom closet build. They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.Pro's 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes Super easy to install, just some screws and off you goCon's If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lotConclusionFor an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price. 	 0
I bought these because they popped up as a sale item. I normally buy more expensive jeans.  I figured these would be good cheap jeans for wearing around house. But once they arrived I realized how nice they are. Looked great and comfortable. I typically wear a 32 waste but have been needing 33 waste lately. These were 33 waste and fit perfect. The legs were a little tight, but not bad. I normally wear a looser fit. This were by no means skinny jeans. 	 0

I wanted to be able to say thank you to my dad who helped me out in the field. He's an avid runner and he loves to get around and do the same. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a hiking pack.  The first time I used it I was going to use it as a backpack and I was so excited to use it.  This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.  It's not a great product, but if you are looking for a pack that's not bulky, it's a good one.  I'd recommend this pack to anyone that wants to take it camping.It's a very nice quality glove.

When I purchased this toy, I was hoping it would be a lot more interactive. It has a lot of music and a lot of flashing lights and the game is pretty much a go-to game for older kids.I think it's going to be a fun game for adults and children. I think it will be fun for kids who enjoy playing with dolls and/or adults who just want to keep things fun for a little while. I like that the game is easy to learn and that it is easy to play. I think the kids will enjoy it too.Overall, this is a fun toy that my 3-year-old son will enjoy. It is fairly simple to play and we have enjoyed it for years. I would recommend this toy for anyone who enjoys the 3D graphics and the music.UPDATE: My son has now received the four figure figure figure and the four figure 	 1

I love earth shoes, i own a few and have purchased them since the 70's. I ordered this sneaker style despite the reviews by some that was less than favorable. They arrived fast, is of a decent quality however, the back of the shoe defies logic. the designer of this shoe should have worn them and then modified them accordingly. The shoe has a very hard ish plastic piece of material that for reasons known only to the designer of this shoe that jute's up past the rim of the sneaker to rub painfully into the back of your calf. this is why, i stated you can wear it for an hour or less but and a big but...if, you have a high tolerance to pain. this is the only area of this shoe that is vastly lacking in foresight and a flaw in its otherwise excellent design. i decided to modify my shoes myself and keep them because they are cute and of course, an earth shoe but seriously, designer!!! modify your design. i might not be so forgiving or tolerant of a poor design flaw where if extra thought were given, as in, the prototype had been worn by the designer, they would have very quickly realized the flaw and modified before mass production and because, this is not to be expected of an earth shoe brand, in other words, it shouldn't exist. i have purchased an arch insert to boost up the arch as I have a high arch and needed extra support, since its a lace up shoe, it has a very generous room for your toes. i ordered a 9 women size which, is a size larger than I normally wear so i would have more room for the fall and winter months when i wear boot socks. 	 0

Prior to buying these rings I was working out on a bar, and find the rings to be much more versatile and potent.  They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.  These are excellent quality and way more than worth the purchase price. 	 0

Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected. 	 0
I have a small breed dog and I thought it would be a nice size for him to go. He loves it. The front part is very clear, and the back is very clear.

A difficult subject matter, but definitely worth seeing.  Richly developed characters and unique story line.  This movie kept me engaged, wondering "How could this possibly end well?"

Strong, solid, believable performance by Isabelle Blais playing a difficult role.  If you like indie films, give this one a shot. 	 0

This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again! 	 0

They flicker and do not dim fully. These are cool white-nowhere near warm white. As expected the cool white stayed the same color when dimmed. The whole reason for dimmable lights is to create a more romantic atmosphere. Think candle light. The light must become redder than warm white. So we replaced the bulb with a tungsten bulb. 	 0

"Sway" is a book that helps me understand the relationship between two women.  It's a book that is so heart-warming.I have to say, I was very impressed by this book.  It was written in a very enjoyable style.  I found it very easy to read.  I was also impressed by the way the author made it clear that her husband was a good friend and mentor to her.  I'm sure she was very generous to both of her children and to her husband.I have a feeling that readers of this book will enjoy it very much.  I am looking forward 	 1

Beyond Repair by Susie Tate is a fun book to read.  Ms Tate had me laughing from start to finish.  This book is well written with amazing characters.  There's plenty of drama and just a hint of heat in Sam and Katie's story.  The best part of this book is the humor.  Beyond Repair is a complete book, not a cliff-hanger.  I enjoyed this book and when I post this review to Amazon I'll be purchasing Goodnight next. 	 0

This worked very well for me. The only problem is that it did not have the reflector. I had to adjust the front sight mount to get the light to be brighter. This is not a problem with the sight. I would suggest using the rear sight mount to get the light to be brighter. I have a Nikon 9mm scope and the scope was defective. I replaced the rear sight mount with a new mount and the rear sight mount was defective. It's very easy to fix the problem. I highly recommend this sight.Perfect for my son.  I love it.  He loved it and he is 5'4" and it is not too big to wear on his head.Great product and shipping was fast.I bought these to replace my old seatpost pads and these are a perfect replacement.

The Great Gatsby is great, but the story is just too full of information for the reader to skim through. The story is told from a very different point of view. The reader is told that Gatsby is in fact a fictional character. If he was, it would have been a little more believable.I found it difficult to read the story at first, but once I did, I had to read it. I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to anyone, but if you like a good, quick read, I highly recommend it.[...]Review by:I received this book from NetGalley for review.I love the characters and the plot.

I wear a 15 narrow. Had set of four black which have lasted forever with hardly any wear, even with the way my feet wander in my shoes. My toenails aren't cutting thru like some of my other socks. This is an order for another 4 black because needed a couple of more between washings and these are now my only socks to wear.

I installed this dimmer to replace an older bulb which failed after a year of use.  This is a very bright bulb and I am very happy with the purchase.  The bulbs are very bright and I am happy with the size of the light.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I love the color and the fact that the light goes out so quickly.  I just installed it to replace a broken one that was in the garage.  I love the light and have had no problems.  The included instructions were helpful and easy to follow.  This bulb is super bright and has a good color temperature.  I would recommend this bulb to anyone that is looking for a good value.  Highly recommend.This is a great tool for getting things done or working in a tight space. It's very useful for removing screws, making screws in tight spaces, and even cutting through wood or concrete. It's also a great tool for cutting things that need to be done in tight spaces.

I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different colors instead of black. 	 0

I was skeptical about these packs as i have used similiar products in the past and always went back to ice. I went on a camping /canoe trip and brought them along with a couple bags of ice. The others on the trip had to go replinish they're ice on day two and my ice was practically unmelted .I did get ice on day three but only because others had went back to town .I think i could have made it without it through day four without refreezing the packs. I definately reccomend purchasing these especially if you plan on being somewhere where ice is a commodity. 	 0
Three and a half starsIf you enjoyed The Reader then you'll enjoy The Speaker which has the same strengths as the first book. You know want to expect with the addition of some new characters and we get deeper into The Guard. Some of The Book passages are more impactful as they help unravel the past and what the future will be.With so many points of view and several timelines, this is a series which takes its time so read this if you want a fantasy that has a more luxurious pace. I still find some do the characters more compelling than others and the story wanders a bit, but the story is sharpening up as we head into the next book in the series. 	 0

I know about flashlights.  Nothing in this review will be an exaggeration, honestly.  This light is not usable in any sense.  The output can only be described as dim.  Thats not a comparative statement.  The "beam" is orange and barely visible.  If you're looking at something small within 2ft of your face,  you can see it if you strain your eyes.  Negotiating the dark is impossible.  Ive honestly never seen a dimmer light in any size, and this one is alot largerthan most keychain lights. 	 0
Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.Five stars. 	 0

This works great if you follow the instructions.  I like the bottle with the injector tip for applying the product more liberally to carpet.  I don't buy this small bottle though.  I buy the gallon bottle and refill the smaller bottles.  I had a dog with bladder stone issues and recurrent UTIs, so I had puddles from time to time.  Some were fresh, some had time to soak in.  Worked like a champ in both cases! This certainly worked better than Natures Miracle, IMHO.  But be sure you read the directions...or it won't work so well.

If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.These pads are 22"X23" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer "odor control". They work very well.Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were "improved". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory. 	 0
This is perfect for what I was looking for.  I had a nice pair of small desktop speakers I wanted to hook up to my PC.  I had the amp connected to the computer in about 5 minutes.  The sound is fairly clean - and I can't really tell if its not totally clean because of my cheap sound card or the amp or the speakers.  For the price, it was a great deal. 	 0

Rand Al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, destined to defeat the Dark One and give his life to save the world while he destroys it in his madness.He sets off alone, searching for his own identity in hopes of proving what he is to himself. He searches for Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. No hand but the true Dragon Reborn can break its wards and draw it.But, as with everything, it is not that simple. There is always a challenge and it is a battle to the finish that threatens to send him over the edge of sanity.Robert Jordan continues his tale with the third installment of The Wheel of Time, better still than the Great Hunt.With four dimensional characters, a vivid vision and the most complicated plot of any story, Jordan transcends the fantastic, discovering a tale truer than any text book, a story for all stories, a legend for all time. 	 0

I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally ("litter-ally"!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats. 	 0

This product is awesome! One of the best cases I have purchased to date for both iPad 2/3 (which have been many). It includes a built in screen protector, and looks to be very solid.

The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!Based on the sample I received, I cannot recommend this knife. 	 0

This movie is a must have for the fans of Sally Field and James Gardner.  It's a fun look at an older man in love with a younger woman.  Sally is excellent in the role of Emma, a recently divorced woman who is also trying to make it alone as a rancher.  Murphy (played by James) is the older gentlemen who is attracted to Emma when she arrives in town with her son.  When Emma's ex shows up the two men vie for Emma which results in some funny situations.  I would rate this movie PG-13 because of the mild sexual content. Great chick flick with a terrific cast. 	 0

As a big fan of the early James Bond, I have tried to continue to enjoy the series of movies that followed the Sean Connery reign as Bond. These latter day movies with actors other than Connery (exception, Roger Moore) are just not satisfying to the older Bond fan. Judi Dench makes a very good "M" and Daniel Craig is almost believable as Bond. The story line is engaging. Waste your time on it if you cannot find any other movie that jumps out at you (to watch). 	 0

We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one. 	 0

Works well and as advertised. My older digital thermometers would always default back to Centigrade when there was a power change, but with the hard C/F switch these stay put.

After receiving Thank You for Your Service by David Finkel, I was curious about what it can deliver since its been ingrained in me toof coursebe thankful for the men and women who serve our country.  Instead, the sadness and depression, the mental toughness being questioned, and the realistic thoughts of suicide permeate many of the service men and woman who come home.  The author shares a completely different side of our troops.  Are we at home ready to not only thank them, but put them into a position to get on with their lives.  It may never be normal again, but they have lives to live and the supporting cast at home is just as impacted.  I took away a message that long-term and sustained help is required for many who need it badly.  I cant imagine what many of the soldiers saw and just knowing that they have to live with in their memories is upsetting.  The after-wars lingering effects can be haunting and I thank the author for bringing this to my attention.   Thomas B. Dowd III, author of The Transformation of a Doubting Thomas 	 0

Due to the circumstances and the financial problems with the film, it's difficult to imagine what the film is going to be like. The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent. The film also has a very good cast, and it has a very good ending. I think the ending is a good one, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a good ending, or if it's just because it's the ending. I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with. It's a lot of fun to watch and there is a lot of action in it. The plot is a bit complex, but I really enjoyed it. The acting is excellent and the plot is a bit convoluted. It's not a bad movie, but if you're not a fan of action, don't watch it. 	 1

I bought this for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas along with the "Tot Tutors Book Rack, Primary Colors".  My daughter-in-law loves both of them.

I use this as bunny litter. I was using the Carefresh one for the longest time but I find this one to be cheaper so I've since switched to this one. As far as odor control this isn't the greatest, after all it is technically bedding, but I have found ways to help it capture the odor. All I do is simply pour the Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer baking soda onto the bottom of the litter box under this bedding and it works great to capture the odor.I recommend to use this as bunny litter if your bunny/rabbit is litter box trained because that's what I do and it's been working out fantastically. 	 0

I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product. 	 0
I read the sexiest man alive and thought, nice....a new author.  I bought this based on my good experience and all the good reviews but I have to say Ms James couldn't decide what story she was telling.  Was it John and Rylynn...?  Kyle and Rylynn...Dex? Rae?  Jordon...the father?  Cameron?  There were so many sub plots going on and nothing was satisfying.  Very disappointing.  I'll have a hard time trying another one. 	 0
I'm a pretty small girl, and I wear a 10.5 in these shoes, which are pretty much a 6.5 in the heel.  The heel is a little too loose, but it's okay.

Got a yellow gold 3mm comfort fit band on lightning deal. What a great buy!! Amazon is awesome. Fits great and I don't even notice that i'm wearing it. Shiny, smooth, and highly polished. I also ordered the traditional fit and it's lil more flush against the finger since it lays flat compared to the comfort fit. Comfort fit is rounded and sticks up from the finger slightly more. This ring is true to size but traditional fit runs 1/2 size smaller. Comfort fit is the way to go... The ring glides on/off like butter. Also 3mm is just right... Not too gaudy but wide enough to take notice. Love it!Update 12/2015: I was able to go to Benchmark ring website and register my ring even though purchased from Amazon. Be sure to email Benchmark and ask about the registering your ring for their Lifetime Guarantee program. They have excellent customer service rep!Update 5/2016: I am happy to report, after wearing the ring 6+ month nonstop, it is holding up nicely! Still shiny and polished. Some scratches but no big deal since I am hard on my hands as it is to be expected while doing the dishes, shower, cooking, etc. 	 0

Thermaltake Mobile Fan 12 External USB Cooling Fan 120mm AF0007 , Got this fan and the Coolerguys 120x120x25mm USB Fan with Grill, both are great, this one is strong to 6" in front of it, the Coolerguys is strong only to 4" in front of it, after that the airflow is not noticed as much if any. I got these to use for my DVR boxes, if you put a fan over the hdd of the DVR box, your box will last for years, otherwise every 2 or 3 years they will crap out on you, my DVRs have been here for over 5  years and I have 3. I think both fans are great and if you want control and more power then go with the Thermaltake, for DVR you only need about 2 inches of airflow so both fans are doing great for me. Hope that helps you a bit. 	 0

Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks. 	 0
I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this "useful" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something. 	 0
I enjoyed the story, but her books always touch my heart and this one fell a little short. And every time the TV show was mentioned Gut It! was used--very distracting. Also, the name of the show was jarring. I picture "gutting" a deer, not a home. HGTV has shows like Generation Renovation, Fixer Upper, Rehab Addict. Ms. Delinsky should have taken her cue from those names. But she still remains one of my favorite authors in this genre. 	 0

Victor Mature plays an ex-GIANT MILITARY FORCE who is now a UNCLE.  The other two characters are all very likable and have the potential to be great.  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that they were all very young and still very young.  I felt that the only reason the movie had a kid-friendly ending was because they had already made a movie about a child and it was pretty weak.  I thought that the main reason for the ending was that they had made the movie about a child 	 1

It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.Overall, this product was very well received and was a great addition to my bike.My husband loves this shirt. He loves that it is made of a thin material and that it has a large chest pocket.  He does wear this shirt on the weekends and he does not mind being able to wear it all the time.

The first novella in the series, The Last Stand is a full length novel that introduces the characters to a world that seems to be a bit beyond the pale. While the story is pretty straight forward, it still has a good plot, and plenty of action. The story starts off with the villain, Ryker, taking the guise of a military man and having to start over. After a while, Ryker realizes he's a guy and moves on. He meets his new love, Angel, who is his best friend 	 1

In Maus, Art Spiegelman illustrates that an academic with a PhD in history and who is a strong believer in the historical accuracy of the historical record is also an excellent historian, and a strong proponent of the historicity of the period.  Spiegelman also suggests that the author has a very good understanding of the history of the time and the role of the different political parties in the struggle for the supremacy of the East.  In addition, Spiegelman notes that the author has a very good knowledge of the history of the period 	 1

MagWorld tiles are fun for kids, and they inspire imaginative play.  My 4-year-old daughter loves to play with these.  There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as "sticky" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.  There may be an added safety benefit in that these tiles are more difficult to break, but the extra "stickiness" of MagnaTiles is appreciated by my daughter. 	 0

The finale was decent- alot of zombies- and they finally got off the farm. If they spend next season only at the prison it will get drawn-out though. Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here. Well, let's see what season 3 brings. I'm hearing talk about the Russian army invading(the Spetsnaz forces were underground and not affected) what's left of the USA and shooting it out with our heroes... now that would be epic! 	 0

Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series.

This is a great little toy. The pieces are sturdy and the pieces fit together well. The only thing that I don't like is that the pieces have a "turn" sound and that it's difficult to turn in the direction you want it to go. I like the fact that the pieces don't come with a magnetic tag, which can be a little annoying since you can't use magnetic tags in the toy. I think it is nice that the pieces fit together nicely and that they can be placed into the toy without having to pull them out.This is a great game.  My kids play it daily.  They do not enjoy it too much.  It is a fun game for younger kids and adults, but my 3 year old likes to play it and I like it.  It is a little hard to figure out the numbers of the words.  We are not really sure how many times the word "my" is used, but we think it is a lot of fun.  We like that it is not hard to figure out the numbers so you can take it on a long trip, and we do enjoy it.  It is not too complicated to get going, but it is not too easy to get moving.  It is a good game for the younger kids, but for older kids it is just a lot of fun.I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it! She is obsessed with the piano and loves it!

I was curious as to how well these balls would hold up.  I have a large German shepherd who is an aggressive chewer.  After he destroyed the first ball after chewing on it for 15 minutes, he has learned to be more gentle of his chewing with them (Note: these balls are tougher then a regular tennis ball, with the added bonus of a squeaky noise when chewed on or squeezed.)  They do seem to be the same size as regular tennis balls.  My boys are very happy with these balls, and I am hoping they will hold up at least for a month.  I think next time I will buy the larger size balls though. 	 0
Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying. 	 0

I had purchased these mugs before and I thought they would be a nice addition to the kitchen. They are so small that I am not sure they would hold up to the same amount of use. They are still very attractive and I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I also love that they are made of the most durable plastic I have ever seen.

This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word "playing" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too! 	 0

The clock arrived quickly but i hate packaging so much. It wrap and wrapped with packing tape... it stick like crazy. I used knife to open it but damn! its too many packing tape.Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price exchange of my honest review.

I used these to nail some rg-6 coaxial cable to the wall and keep it out of the way. There's a bit of space, so maybe a 6 mm cable clip would've been a better option for the cable I'm using. But I couldn't beat the price, and it works well enough. Can't complain. 	 0

I have had the Ridgid and Ridgid combo for a couple of months now and have not had a problem. The Ridgid has been around for a while now and it is still working well. The Ridgid has a very thin blade and it has a lot of power. The Ridgid has a good grip and the Ridgid is very comfortable. I would recommend the Ridgid over the Ridgid combo. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for small jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value. I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to install. It was easy to adjust the fan speed and the speed and the height of the fan. The height was easy to adjust, so you could adjust the height of the fan, the height of the fan and the height of the fan. It was easy to install and it was easy to adjust the height of the fan. I am pleased with the quality of this product. I have been using this light for years and it works great. It is pretty bright. It is a bit smaller than I had expected but it is great for small jobs. It is a little bulky but it's plenty bright for those small jobs. I have not used it for a lot of jobs yet but it is great for a small area where I can not use it. 	 1

About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college "students" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the "students" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, "OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, "Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued "college students" I've ever seen in a movie.Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart. 	 0
cannot wait for the movie. I love the writing. I read it for my students and they loved it. Great story! I look forward to the next book in the series. 	 1

This is simply the best religious film, and one of the best films of any kind ever made. It is far away the best treatment of Jesus' life on film. I like the dubbed version because of the excellent quality of Enrico Maria Salerno's voice as Christ. This film has one of the most effective uses of music on film, and the direction is pure poetry. It also remains faithful to the words and emotional feel of Matthew's gospel, and it captures nuances from the other gospels as well. I have been disappointed with other transfers of this film to DVD, but this one works the best for me. 	 0

On the plus side, the spout is wide enough to fit a lot of cheese, and the extra space is great.

I started watching this series on a whim after seeing a few episodes on my TV. I just wanted to see how the series would be played. The basic premise of the show is that a young girl is kidnapped by a gang of drug dealers. She is brought to the scene and is put in a cell.I found it entertaining and I loved it. I've seen all of the movies and I liked the first one a lot. The second one was a bit of a disappointment. I wanted to see how the series would be played, but I was disappointed. I didn't even know it was a series until I watched it on a weekend. I'm glad I did, but I still have to see it again. I loved it, and I'll buy it again. I was a little disappointed, but it was fun to watch. I'll see it again. I love the characters and the plot.This is a movie that I enjoyed watching over and over.  It's very funny and good acting.

when i got this boxed set, i could vaguely remember the show, and that i thought at the time, it was funny. i still lived in the u. s. some of the time, then. back inswitzerland, there are now a lot of the new shows, and some are even in english, which is great. but "just shoot me" played a while back, and was always dubbed. too much of the humor gets lost that way, so i avoid watching it. anyway, i got the first set, and loved every minute of it! what a fun show (and being a professional photographer myself, i appreciate it maybe even more)i can't understand though, why it's taken over 2 years since the first release of season 1&2, and want to know what the hold-up is. where's season?is it even gonna come out eventually?great show, in any case, great talent and very funny storylines. 	 0

Robert Kirkman (Author), Jay Bonansinga (Author)Glocks = Do not have safeties.  Contrary to what you think.Ford S10 = Umm, it was Chevrolet, not ford that made this little pickup. Ford makes the Ranger.Stock = Rifles have stocks, Handguns have grips.Clip = Hanguns have Magazines, a couple of models of extremely old rifles used a clip, which has an entirely different design.Steel-Plated Revolver = Umm. What is this?  What is the steel plating? more steel? is the core lead?  Gimme a break.These are just a few of the glaring errors with both of these authors.  They are playing in a sandbox where they know nothing, but at least they know nothing with consistency because these errors pop-up repeatedly.  Over and Over again.I really despise lazy authors who do not at least do some research before they begin writing about something they know nothing about.  Quality material requires research guys, and this is not quality material.  There's a reason why some authors are constantly on the best seller lists, and some aren't, and this is why.Get it right next time or stop writing.  A novel is not a comic book where your audience is in their teens and incredibly forgiving (or ignorant of such things).You two should be ashamed of yourselves. 	 0
Wow.  After a somewhat brief break, the book is back in action, and I'm pretty sure that's what the publisher wanted, but that's the point of the book.  The book is well written, and the characters are well developed.  This is a very good book, and a very good book to read.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about modern science, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get involved in the field of science.This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I read it several years ago and am still reading it. 	 1

AMERICAN SNIPER begins with Kyle's first sniper kill and then follows his path from childhood all the way through his enlistment until he leaves the Navy in 2009. Reading about the way Kyle grew up and the life he led before becoming a SEAL really gives insight into what sort of person it takes to be a special forces operator. Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a "good ol' boy". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading.

So I gave three but I wanted to give two stars. This is very expensive first off to not be a great product. Now the sizing I would def size up if you don't like it to be so tight. As the day goes on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 weeks after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy sucks cause you have to keep the tags on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 days regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well! Eventually you will get the body back! 	 0
I bought them in white and they are very comfortable. I will keep them for the summer and they will be fine. The only thing I would say is if you are a skinny person like me, these are not for you.

My daughter loves it, but it takes a lot of practice for it to make a difference.  It is so small that it can be a bit difficult to put it in a toy box.  It is still fun to play with, though.  My daughter is still very interested in the toy.  I have to admit that I did not realize the size of the box until I opened it.  This toy is not meant for children under 6.  It is very small for what it is, but my daughter is still enjoying it.  This toy is well made and the color is bright.  It is definitely worth the money.My son loves this car 	 1
Continues where the first one started. The story is a bit slow and the characters seem to just keep getting stuck in the story. The characters are not the most likable of the characters but it's fun to watch. 	 1
I gave this 4 not 5 stars just because it is a bit rough looking. It is beautiful and I would have given in 4.5 stars if I could. It is beautiful and I get tons of compliments but it is a bit (cant find the word.......) It is a nice quality nice design but looks handmade. Not sure if that is the word because it does not look cheap but I hope you get my point. 	 0

The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust. 	 0
The good news: The headphones work great. The Mic is clear and the buttons are perfectly located for my 68 year old hands.The bad news: They are to small for my big head, if they come down another .250 Inch they would fit perfectly. Because they work and sound so good I will live with .250.Picture the set on a head. There is a very sharp teat on the top left side of the black plastic piece that slides down. I was able to remove them (on both sides) with no problem but it is sharp enough to scratch a small finger. 	 0
This book has all the elements of the "W" series, but also a lot of the elements that make it unique. I liked the story and the characters, so it was a nice change of pace. It was a little slow for me.I really enjoyed this book 	 1

Lineup by Liad Shoham is a fun, entertaining, and engrossing read. I was particularly impressed with the writing style and the characters.  The story itself is interesting, and it's worth the read.  Highly recommended.I enjoyed this book. I don't know how I would recommend it to anyone but I will say that I had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I did not like the fact that it ended a little slow. I don't like the ending, but I will say that I enjoyed it.  I think it was a little too predictable and predictable. I really liked the characters, and I found that the main character was very likable. I was a bit disappointed with the ending, but I think I enjoyed it a lot. I also liked that the ending was not the same as the book. I think the ending was a little abrupt, but that's just my opinion. I enjoyed the book a lot.I'm not a fan of the YA books, but this one was amazing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to read and enjoy the language.  I loved it.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the history of the Great War and the American Revolution.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read history and fantasy.I've read a few books by Dan Brown, and this one is definitely a great read.

This is a more advanced coaster kit for the older kids.  Younger ones will need help/guidance but that's not unusual with the larger K'NEX coaster building kits.This was a nice challenge for our more experienced builders but they'd played with a larger set in their "ACE" class at school and knew a bit of what to expect.  Once built they had to make the usual adjustments needed for many of these coaster builds (they had to do this at school as well) but once those were made they had great fun running the coaster around the track.  They're already talking about what modifications they'd like to make and designing alternate track layouts.Highly recommended. 	 0
Finally a detector that works to find the nails in plaster lathe.  I have an old house with plaster walls and for years I have found that stud finders do not work well on plaster walls.

I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.Im standing and clapping right now.Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.Yes, Regina is my new hero and the foster care and child protective services system will be a better place because of her.Im not ready to switch political parties just yet, but oh hell, why notRegina Calcaterra for President. 	 0

I haven't used this yet but I am anticipating I will in the next few weeks. We were giving some antelope skins by someone so we my young son could practicing tanning and maybe make some moccasins from the skin. The first thing we noticed was that there was a lot of 'meat' on the skin still.So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.I believe having this tool in hand will be very helpful. I'll try to update after we have used it on our hides. 	 0

Rob Zombie is the most lethal of the bunch, and I'm not going to tell you how. But the film is a solid film, and if you're a fan of Zombie movies, this one is a good one to pick up.

This is a high quality weight bar.  It is rated to 1650 pounds, which I cant imagine anyone actually putting on a weight bar.  It is well made, fit and finish is excellent.  The 2" ends are mounted on bearings which allow for smooth rotation.  There is a nice black finish on the bar, which I doubt will last long once it gets used, but when it wears off it won't chip off like the shiny chrome or nickel plated bars seem to do.This is an excellent bar at a great price, don't hesitate to pick one up!

This was a good story and I really liked the characters but this read more like a really long Prologue rather than an actual full book. The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up. Overall I enjoyed it but I think it still needs developing. 	 0
This dog toy is well made and the pieces are sturdy. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you don't mind it being a bit small it's a good size for a small dog. The only problem I have with this toy is that the toys break apart when they are chewed on. I have tried several different types of toys with this toy, and none of them have broken apart like this one. I have tried other types of toys, but this one has been destroyed. I just wish that this one had a lid. This toy is a good size for a small dog. 	 1
I love when Ms. Shara writes a book. Only problem I have with her books some are less than 40pages long. Most of her books are part a series, like this one. Two-part so far there is third one. But it has not been released, I waiting for that one.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE interracial menage paranormal stories. The plot is interesting. The characters are likeable. The heroine is white witch and heroes are 4 alpha werewolves.  Yes handle your business lady. I hope third one come soon. Heroine realized there is another white witch and she is endangered.

The Battery keeps discharging - almost every time I need to use it, it's dead or near dead.  After a few months of use it will only charge to 90% and once you take if off the USB charger, it drains in about 1 week when not used at all, and when I did attach it and begin using it for a few minutes the charge shows 50%.  I have a DUD !Had the battery BacPac worked as advertised it would have been useful.The battery has it's own usb port for charging and a small meter on the back which you can check by pressing a small button on the side of the battery - I suspect the electronics inside the battery is defective. 	 0

If you go with the eMMC option like I did, be aware that you'll likely need to get the dongle converter from Transcend in order to work with the chip outside of the native OS itself on another system.

I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also. 	 0

This mixer saves me so much time and effort.  It handles an 80 lbs bag very nicely.  Does good with 2 80 lbs bag after you get it started.  It tends to loose some mix on its initial rotation.

The plot is about part of the lifetime of Theo, from childhood to middle age, he is a NYC boy who loses his mother in an art gallery due to an explosion of an unknown origin and after the accident he takes and remove a valuable painting "The Goldfinch" painted by a Rembrandt student, highly regarded as a masterpiece by his dead mother. Stealing this painting is punished by Law. Then, the painting becomes his life companion, his treasure and the same time his burden, he keeps it hidden in many places under the bed in a storage rented room, wherever, one cannot anticipate what awaits to Theo and the painting, and the author comes and go many times, playing with this enticing situation. The story, carefully written and with a polished prose has its up and downs, sometimes very quick paced, bright, crisp and very interesting, and other times it plods along, overburdened with too much unnecessary details but not the point of getting boring,Some character developments are noteworthy like Boris, Theo`s friend, this spry, lively character seems to be popping out of the pages and in my opinion the best feature of the book. 	 0

I was always a fond of this film as a kid, part Island of Lost Souls, part sci-fi and part historical nonsense, Atlantis the Lost Continent is certainly entertaining and for those of us who remember it fondly, this DVD release will surely be a treat. The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale. 	 0
3.5 stars. I did enjoy this book and the characters. I will definitely read more from this author.I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed. I would highly recommend this book.This was an excellent read. The characters were strong, likable, and the story line was great. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read.I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine who is strong. I liked how the story was written.

Movie hype made the movie seem alot better than it turned out to be.  Its like you have seem this movie before, like in any one of the james bond movies with a much sadder ending. I sure could have done with out this ending. It will make watching this movie again a lot harder to do 	 0
I was so surprised by how large this actually is. My dogs love it. Packaging is great, but a little wasteful. I mean, this product obviously isn't going to get damaged, but it had a huge box and packing bubbles. The toy is really long and flat, no stuffing at all. It has three squeakers in it. SO annoying, but I buy them anyway because my dogs can't get enough. I love that it is so long because the dogs can both rough house with the same toy while they're playing. And little shards aren't all over the place like with the rope bones. The stitching and material must be pretty impressive because my dogs have rolled, wrestled and been nuts with this thing and it is still holding up after 48 hours. I don't think it will last the weekend, but it has already outlasted most of their rope bones and other toys. (Other than chuck it balls, those things are truly indestructible). Great fabric, great toy!! My doggies love it :) 	 0

I know it indicates that these measure a 1/4-inch, but having a visual would be would be useful. So it would be nice if Amazon included an image showing these in an earlobe to give a better indication of their size. They are quite a bit smaller than I expected. As someone else mentioned, they would work perfectly in a second piercing, as they are about the size of a stud. That said, they are cute, but I probably would not have gotten them if I knew how small they were. Also, they look a bit crude to me. I got a fleur de lis necklace when I was in New Orleans and it is so beautifully made, with a lot of attention to detail. I did not think these had nearly that same level of detail or refinement. 	 0

I liked this book but I didn't love it! I had some issues with Allie. To me a lot of the time she came across as self-centered, snobby and judgmental! I also hated how she would say "my half brother" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers.I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say "this is love" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say "I love you" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!I will however read Darius and Taylor's story. 	 0

This timer performs all the same functions and it is much lower in cost. I'm hoping that is will last longer than 2 years. We've had it hooked up for a month with no problems. The programming was essentially the same. The display is very crisp and buttons are tactile. [. 	 0

I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...Here's what I liked about the case: - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected. - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too "fake"What I didn't like: - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own. - The small clips that hold the iPad in the case on the left side. I couldn't understand why they couldn't use a longer band to hold the device in like the right side. 	 0

This is a powerful little vacuum and really is a pet hair eraser.  I had to rush my german shepherd to the vet the other day and didn't have enough time to cover the car seats.  Consequently, every seat in the car was literally covered in fur.  I used the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum this morning and within one hour my car looked new inside again.  It has a very strong suction, and the pink rubber tip loosens the hair that sticks to the upholstery so it can be easily vacuumed.  I highly recommend this little gem and the price makes it even better! 	 0

Works great for me. I installed it on my savage axis 223 and took less than 2 minutes. It clips onto the sling nob and then tightens down. You tighten it down with a thumb screw, but it also has an option for a Phillips screwdriver if you want it tighter. The legs extend easily and quickly and feel sturdy. Folds up easy and quickly. It has a nice look to it feels strong. The swivel is a nice feature to have, and you can adjust it to make it tighter or looser. I would recommended this item to anyone who is looking for a cheap durable bipod. 	 0
The color matches my real 18k gold jewelry. They're so pretty in person, a great size, just shy of half an inch and a substantial weight. They sit beautifully on my earlobe and are very comfortable. I love them and highly recommend them to anyone wanting a classic everyday pair of earrings. 	 0

This was a good read. I loved the characters and how the story progressed.Linda is a strong character and she will do anything to for her son. His happiness is what she wants and when an old love comes back into town, Linda knows she has to tell him the truth about Mac but it won't be easy. I really like the way Linda grew within the pages of this story. She started out shy but she found her true inner self. I loved the way Dave wouldn't give up on what he wants and that is getting to know his son and getting to realize Linda all over again.The sex was hot but there wasn't a lot but the scenes that are in here, made me sweaty just reading it. This book is so worth the read! 	 0

This retractable leash is the perfect size and quality. I will definitely be buying this again. Great product. Great price. I am a small dog, and this collar is very large. It is very easy to put on, and it is adjustable. I ordered two for my two small dogs, one medium and one large. The medium one is a little longer than the large one, but it fits perfectly. The small one is a little bigger than the medium one, but it is perfect for me. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix. She is a bit smaller than most dogs, but she is still a little bit on the small side, so I thought she would be fine. She's a bit bigger than most dogs, but she is still a little on the small side.

Seemingly the mature reader would find it difficult to finish. I did find that the characters were pretty interesting.

A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities. 	 0
This watch was a lot bigger and heavier than I'd expected. I have thin wrists. I wear Medium-sized gloves. This watch looks comical on my naked wrist and feels ungainly.This is not a watch for everyday use. This is for sportsmen, to be strapped atop bulky clothing. The watch feels very strong and rugged, good for rough sports activity. Were I to see a man wearing this watch at a formal function, I'd think he was "trying too hard" to impress, wearing such a gaudy (albeit attractive) timepiece.I've read that watches are declining in sales, because so many people now rely on their smart phones to know the time. Watches are increasingly being used as jewelry, or to make a statement. This watch is certainly eye-catching. But this watch is also useful if you're wrapped in bulky sports clothes, and don't want to fumble for the smart phone in your pocket.Plus, this watch has a second hand. My smart phone provides no way for me to measure the passing of seconds. So this watch also serves as a stop watch.My watch came with the WRONG MANUAL. It came in a nice box, with a nice paper manual. But the watch described in the manual is not the one that came in the box. My watch's face and features are entirely different from the diagrams of the watch in the manual. For instance, my watch only has a second hand, not the 1/10 of a second hand pictured in the manual.The watch pictured on this Amazon page is the watch you will get (not the watch described in the manual). 	 0

Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro becomes janitor of a dorm populated by a quintet of stunningly beautiful, but dangerously abusive women -- one of which may turn out to be his secret sweetheart who he apparently promised would attend Tokyo U fifteen years ago. The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase "love hurts." Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in. 	 0
My daughter likes the 2012 Barbie Holiday Doll . She said that the doll is very pretty because of the "more dramatic makeup", and her hair comes curly which is fairly unusual.The only downsides were with the packaging. It was hard to open without messing up the doll's hair, and it was easy to lose the shoes. We accidentally threw the shoes away, but fortunately, we found them before it was too late. 	 0

Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this. 	 0

The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's "studly" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.The film is passable entertainment.I just kept waiting for the discovery of an underground "civilization" that might have been responsible for all the above ground havoc. 	 0

These are soooooo instrumental in keeping me happy with my purchase. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice!  I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect addition. I really like that it comes with a rubber seal to keep my blades from scratching each other. I also like the fact that the blade is very easy to clean and that the blades are on a smooth surface. I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage. I also like that the blades are larger than I thought. It also helps to keep my blades clean even if I accidentally scratch them. 	 1

As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be "the bomb". Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The "forward-facing" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for "thawing" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice. The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side). All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that. 	 0
When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.So enjoy this movie for what it is. I do. 	 0
Watched four episodes just to find out the story line. I saw it for the first time and was so pleased. The movie is a bit long, but the first two were pretty good. I had no idea that this film would be so well written and acted. The acting is great. The story is well told and the locations are beautiful. There is also a beautiful scene where a young man is able to go to the beach and swim down the river. The movie is very well acted. 	 1

I just got these in a gift and they look great. I also have a large one. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golfing and fishing trips for about two years now. He loves it. He said it's a great addition to his golfing and fishing gear. It's made of very high quality materials and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this to anyone. I love this helmet, it has a really nice reflective coating.

These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism. 	 0
Not bad!  Considering how much cheaper this cutter is that the ones at the big box stores (and even here on Amazon), this is a great value.  Made cuts just like it should.  Only reason for not getting five stars is that it's aesthetically rough... there's clearly no finish work done to this item once that stamp it out and assemble it at the plant... other than a quick, shabby paint job (which, for the record is orange, not yellow as in the picture)... but again, these are all issues with the way it looks, which I could care less about... It does the job, and it's way cheaper than it's closest competitor. 	 0

Nice quiet fan. However - it has the design flaw of being a little more noisy. I'm not sure why.  The design of the fan is the same as the fan I replaced.  The fan is quiet enough to be quiet enough to enjoy the outdoors.  If you have a large home with a large fan, it will be louder.  If you have a small home with a small fan, it will be quieter.  The sound level is a little low for me, but if you have a large home, it will be louder. 	 1
Book begins with Garnet Hyde, an aspiring journalist, and her friend Gwen, a local newspaper reporter.  The story is told from Garnet's point of view.  In this book, Gwen is described as a beautiful, independent woman.  This is a wonderful story for young people.  I liked the characters and the story line.

Sick & Stupid Score:  6/9*More of the current national neurosis that is gripping the Ritalin Generation:  Your memories are not your own; you have no idea who you are; an evil force is controlling your life.  And way more of the feminist fantasy that girls can be as tough as boys.  More escape-and-capture sequences than a 1930's cowboy and Indian Saturday matinee movie.  More "Blade Runner"-style racial diversity than "Blade Runner."  More computer-generated graphics than....When will these awful movies ever end?____________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie. 	 0

It really does look as though it will be very durable.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I am using it in the shop, so it is not yet ready to be used.If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should also consider a 2 pack of these to keep in your car.Cheers!We have had great luck with these lights for over a year now. They work well and are very bright. They are bright enough for the small jobs, but they are not too bright for the larger jobs. I am using them for work that requires some lighting. I can't say enough good things about these lights. They are well made and are very bright. I would recommend these to anyone.If you are looking for a little LED light that is bright enough for your needs, this is it. It is very well made and is easy to use. It is very convenient to have a small LED light on hand when working in the dark. It is very easy to install, it is easy to use and it is very easy to program.

We had a similar experience that someone else expressed - we have the the Maisto Desert Rebel 1967 Ford Mustang GT Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale) and the Maisto Desert Rebel Volkswagen Beetle Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale). Both of our vehicles came in the 49 Mhz frequency which makes them hard to use together which can be a problem since I have two sons who want to play together. It came be a bit frustrating because they want to play with their cars at the same time but at 9 and 11 years old, they overcome the issue be just staying apart enough distance so it isn't a problem.The Mustang is super cool and the kids (and Dad) thought this one was the coolest. Weve always had sort of hit or miss results with R/C vehicles and this one has been slightly better than average for us.Battery usage is high as you would expect. Run time on charge is decent.Batteries required:Controller - 2 AAAVehicle - 6 AA 	 0

I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide. 	 0

Honestly, these headphones were quite mindblowing, and a solid step up from the Panasonics which are so popular here on Amazon.The sound quality made me feel ecstatic, and seems appropriate for all genres. I simply love blasting these things and hearing a surprisingly high level of detail in my music. Plus, the wires stay smooth and separated. Sadly, the earbuds don't isolate noise so well, as I often ride bike / go jogging with these, you can hear the wires rubbing and the wind interference, causing you to boost the volume in such situations. But for every other user, you can't go wrong! 	 0

I appreciate this book on so many levels, I don't know where to even start this review. The Life List by Lori Nelson Spielman is a study of a person's transformation from a life being led to a life worth leading. The journey, however, is not without its own set of trials and tribulations.When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago.  It is only when Brett's mother passes away from cancer that the layers begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface.To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it comes to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who has orchestrated some of the events Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goals she made when she was just 14 and as is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the items on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goals penned as a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.Working through the list at first is challenging but watching her grow and evolve as she tackles each item, is miraculous, amidst surprise upon surprise but I will leave those surprises to be discovered by the reader.I really enjoyed this and am sure others will too.Recommend. 	 0
This newest offering in the Men in Blue series is my favorite so far, Although Ben, Ryan and Shari have pasts filled with unimaginable horrors and have suffered significant losses, they continue to survive and thrive. That's not to say this book is filled with happy, shiny people. They story is populated with characters who support and stand with each other no matter what happens. It's great to see "old" friends from previous MIB books and the introduction of 2 new characters gives me hope that more stories are to follow. The suspense blends well with the lighter moments like the "unicorn salute" and the sex scenes are typical Jayne Rylon quality...smokin' hot. I received an ARC in return for an honest review. 	 0

If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;4) lots of bad acting;5) awful music of any genre.SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief. 	 0

Admittedly I am a huge fan of the author and her characters.  This book is a pretty good read.  I've read most of her other books and have enjoyed them very much.  This one is not one of those.  There are some very good parts.  The first part is about the woman who saves the man from the wolves and becomes the first wolf to ever kill a human.  The second part is about the two wolves who are a part of the story and the man who is one of the wolves.  I loved that part.I read this book in two days.  I have read every one of the other books that I have read.  I enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read wolf stories.  It is a good story with lots of great characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.  I was expecting a bit of romance but that didn't happen.

I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft. 	 0

Anyone with knowledge of Anne and Mary Boleyn and their relationships with Henry VIII will see that this is tabloid fiction, pure and simple. The timetables and events are total fabrications. Yes, Anne was alleged to have had relationships with her brother. But to see this depicted as fact in this movie? Well, just look at the costumes. I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good. 	 0
Having lost 5 bikes in a year. Yes Im new to Long Beach and did not know this place was bike theft capital of the Unites States. I tell you something. I do write reviews for AMZ review Trader and I do get things either for free or at a huge discount on things I write about which id cool but doing so and getting this lock for my bike after all that Ive lost and two of those being GT bikes I can safely tell you with all confidence that if you don't lock your bike up here in Long Beach CA it will be as good as gone I don't care if it only has one wheel and no seat.  Since Ive gotten this lock they have still tried to steal a bike I have. I could see where they tried to cut through the cable but they coldly get through. A Big shout goes out to the people that sell this lock. And a thank you . because I don't know how Id get around with out it.  Having this lock is a lot better than one I had that looked almost just like it but it was cut through. Thats all I found where I had my bike locked up at. The lock rocks thank you guys again ! 	 0

Dug a hole, put in some gravel, drilled some holes in a 5 gallon bucket and set this thing in. Powerful and compact, it has worked great in my crawlspace. Not loud at all, and only runs for a few seconds to clear out the bucket. I did install the check valve of the same brand name, that has worked great also.I like the metal housing instead of the plastic of their cheaper models, and the vertical float allows it to fit in the 5 gallon bucket with room to spare. 	 0

I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them. 	 0

Gave five stars and would have given more if available....this was a wonderful story of love, heartache & forgiveness.  Such a beautifully written story.

It has a very solid structure, far different than many others netbooks that have a plastic body. Design is nice, it's a pretty and sexy machine. I wouldn't say fantastic because of its strange rear "increment". Anyway, better than the Acer Aspire. Keyboard is OK.But, when it comes to performance... well, everytime you restart it or open Internet Explorer or Microsoft Office 2007, you'll remember that your old desktop machine performs better than this new little one and that you should have spent a few more bucks for a Dual-Core or a Core2Duo machine with more RAM. 	 0

This is a well made, sturdy, lightweight, comfortable case.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit too small for a laptop.  I would definitely recommend it.

This is a very long and heavy rope and you can definitely feel the effect of carrying out any of the exercises in the following day or so. There are quite a few varied exercises to try and they are easy to learn. It seems that the focus is on the upper body so I'm not sure you'll end up looking like the people pictured on the box. Still, it's a fairly intense workout and certainly makes a welcome change to using the machines at the gym.My only criticism is that you need a considerable amount of space to really use the rope effectively.

Update (8/2/2014):It has been two years and the switch is still working great.Update:I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.By the way don't bother calling the "technical service number", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.comold review:Bought this switch from the local home improvement store.  The switch stopped working reliably after about 1 week.  You have to switch it back and forth and press down on it hard to get the light to stay on.  The GFCI outlet seems to work fine. 	 0

This is a story about a young girl with a history of being a killer. She is one of the few survivors. The story moves at a steady pace and the characters are strong and interesting. The author does a great job of making the characters believable. This is a great series for young people.I loved this book!  I can't wait to read the next one!I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review.This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a different take on the characters of the first book. I was very curious about this book, and it has it all. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.The story is very detailed and engaging. There are a few surprises along the way. I found myself laughing out loud and enjoying this book.The story is very well written, and the characters are well developed. I really enjoyed reading this book.I am always on the lookout for more books by this author. I was very impressed with this one! 	 1

UPDATE-Decided to update my impression of the figure now that i'm over my excitement i saw some flaws =/ the paint on her left boot had no smear but it was like they added a little too much white over the white causing it to look like an over painted finger nail but it didn't go past the area where it needed to be painted but it did look like a little too much was added, also I saw a very tiny and almost unnoticeable paint chip on her left pigtail .-. now that i see it.. I can't stop knowing it's there >.< it's so small yet annoying like a tiny spec of gray dust you can't remove T-T.. The figure overall is great but quality was lacking =/ so upset that I now see these flaws :I it'll be hard for most of us to sell them in these conditions especially in the future .-., If you're buying it please be careful with them because honestly if your like me you'll flip over things being ehhhhh even if it's so tiny X.xOLD-I loved this and so did my cousin when she saw it with me ^-^ I can't tell you how happy I am to own this figure :3 it came perfect with no missing pieces, no paint mistakes, no loose or falling off pieces :D it sticks all right and hasn't fallen apart :P I'm so happy with it and I can't tell you how pleased I am that it came safely =) guess amazon heard the complaints and took precaution with future figures :D 	 0

This chopper is perfect for keeping an open space on a small area.The handle has a suction cup that is easy to use and is easy to clean.I like that it is glass and not plastic so it will be easier for me to clean.It is a bit difficult to clean because it has a metal handle and it is a little rough to use because of that.I do think that it will be easier to clean since I have not used it yet.Overall, I would buy this chopper again.It is a very good quality, and the price is great.I would not recommend this to anyone except those who want to have a nice, small, large, or small kitchen.I had a few complaints with it, but the ones that I have with it are a good deal.My only complaint is that the handle slides out of the way when you lift it up, but that is not a problem with the other choppers I have.The chopper is also very quiet.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook a large or small cooking area.I have used this chopper a few times, and 	 1

Cute.  Grandson loved them.  They are just a bit larger than matchbox cars.  They seemed a bit pricey since you can get a regular matchbox or hotwheel car for $1, but these do seem to be a bit heavier and well built, and of course, they are the Avengers, so Grandson loved them. 	 0

I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper. 	 0

I was so disappointed at the end of this book. Main characters are so blah. No personalities at all. Storyline is confusing and vague. I kept thinking that there would be a twist in the story where everything came together and made sense. It never did happen and I was left thinking...is it me? This book received outrageously good reviews, but the plot was so abstract, that I never made a connection with it at all. Really sad and disappointed. :-(  On to the next book 	 0

Assembling the unit takes about 5 minutes.  You will need one 7/16" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.  My gutter-cleaning problems are now over.Side note:  I agree with another reviewer that the sheet-metal edges are very sharp and could definitely use a little sanding. 	 0

I owned a couple of other trail running shoes before, but got to say this is the most high tech one.  What interests me about these shoes are the fact they are as comfortable as tennis or running shoe.  Two, I live in the Northwest and at time do wondering into the forest now and then.  What actually caught my eye was the nifty color scheme orange and black then the cable shoe laces.  This looks good, I seen a NorthFace with the twist lock, but that is bulky.  I never own Salomon's shoe before, but do own some of their snowboarding equipments and got to say they are a specialty company.Features:Well I am using this in the snow for the time being because it is gore-tex to keep out the water.  It isn't the warmest, but it you wear thinker sock then it is fine and it keep water out and heat in like most Gore-tex product.

The Teva's rubber sole grip on the bottom is already worn down in less the half a year.  I hope this "Contagrip" last a little longer.  Both have OrthoLite insole.  Most shoes are narrow so I have to get a half a size larger, but not for this XT Wing, it has a wider base.

This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time. 	 0

We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though. 	 0

The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store. 	 0

This sounds like a small, bulky, lightweight, comfortable, and inexpensive light. I have one in my bathroom.  The other, a small, light-weight, portable light, is just a bulb.  It is a thin, plastic, light-weight, portable light.  It is a great solution to the most common problems with low-energy LED lighting.  I will say that this LED light is not meant for an everyday use.  It is very sensitive to light and is very bright.  The light is very small, which is why I put it in a larger light.  It is designed for use indoors, not outdoors.  It is a good, inexpensive light for the price.  The "top" is bright and bright.  I like it.  I have a little flashlight that is aimed at my bedroom 	 1

As you will see in the attached image, I have thick thighs and a slightly big butt for my size but I usually wear a medium in compression pants, the smalls fit but are difficult to get into, but the mediums are usually perfect. This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type. I received these pants at a discount in exchange for an honest review, however that did not affect my opinion of the product. 	 0

A nice affordable starter set in the series with many good details. The large dark red octopus looks amazing, and definitely does not disappoint. The diver has good detailing with a nice print diving suit, some of which is in bright silver. On the back and front there is black-and-red upper body, the figure has a red helmet, red flippers, a grey air tank, and a transparent light-blue diving mask.The yellow-and-grey scuba scooter has great detailing with rotating propellers, two harpoons and bendable arms which the diver can use to explore the sea floor and possibly to poke at the poor octopus. Lastly you have included in this set, is one light green seaweed-type plant on a round plate.All in all a nice little set on its own, or great point to start collecting and adding to new Lego City Explores set. 	 0

This short story focuses again on Luke and Simon and serves to show just how strong and lasting their love is."I've loved you since the first moment you kissed me to shut me up. Nasty tactic, as I can't object when I've got a mouthful of your tongue. There has only ever been you since that moment. And there will only ever be you, Simon Bryan. You are mine, only mine, and if anyone ever looks at you again, I will string them up by the balls and kill them, slowly and painfully." Luke to Simon"I've loved you since the first moment I say you. Little did I realise what a possessive pain in the ass you were going to be. If I'd known... I'd still be here now, even if you are a high maintenance (insert an amazon declared naughty word here)." He brushed his thumb over Luke's cheek, laughing softly at Luke's look of outrage. "I will always love you. You fill my head and my heart. There will never be anyone else in my life, Luke Murray. Just you." Simon to Luke.No great drama in this story, just a nice acknowledgment of love. 	 0

I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.  Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.  I loved this book and hope that more Weston books will be coming. 	 0

Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a "grind off" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it. 	 0
I liked getting an American based movie and that they changed some of the terms such as Muggle to No-mag (spelling?) because that is true to the culture, America may be the offspring of Britain and we may all speak English but we still change things to make it our own lift vs elevator for example.It definitely had a different feel than the previous HP movies, darker, older, more mature. But it's still neat to see the origins of some of the HP lore 	 0

In CARNAL INNOCENCE author Nora Roberts has created a mesmerizing tale of madness, murder, and love in a small southern town of the bayou.  Put into play is Caroline Waverly, a beautiful world renowned concert violinist who is still fragile from both a public breakup and private breakdown after witnessing her lover with another.  Caroline, has left the concert circuit escaping to her late grandmothers home in Innocence, Mississippi.  However instead of the peace and tranquility she expected, she found a town reeling from two vicious and heinous murders. And, if that weren't enough Caroline discovers a third victim on her property.Enter Carolines devastatingly handsome bad-boy neighbor - Tucker Longstreet.  Big, beautiful with a devilish grin and the sexiest southern drawl ever.  But for some reason, Tucker makes Caroline feel safe even though his reputation for breaking hearts has put him at the top of the suspect list, seeing as how he was connected to each of the murdered women.***  Lordy, lordy, but I have listened to Tom Stechschulte before and I have to say that NO ONE does sexy Southern drawls like Mr. Stechschulte!  He is a master of making a written hero pop to life as one very SEXY heart throb - just by hearing that rich southern interpretation.  Wow!  And let me also say that the sensuality both actual and implied was steaming all the way through to the very end!Now mix that with exquisite storytelling by Nora Roberts and you have a perfect combination that will force you to keep listening way into the middle of the night and then turning it back on as soon as you wake up!  Be it children, heroes or heroines, pets, even nasty villains  - Ms. Roberts writes the books that grab you and simply won't let you go.  Loved every minute of this audiobook, the outstanding performance of Mr. Stechschulte and the entire cast of characters who made this very hard to put down  and immensely satisfying book!Marilyn Rondeau 	 0
Our two inside cats can smell up the laundry room quickly when they use their litter box with standard clumping type litter. What a breath of fresh air these pine pellets are!  The pellet breaks down with liquids and solids are easily removed.  Never any urnine or feces smell, but instead a fresh pine odor. Highly recommend this to all inside cat owners. I won't use anything else from now on. Free shipping also offered with those 40 pound bags, so you can't go wrong. 	 0

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters. The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book. 	 1

I love Julia Quinn's books and I've been looking forward to this one which didn't disappoint. Billie and George seem like opposites, but in truth, have some of the same insecurities about their situations in life. Billie has always been closest to George's younger brothers and George has found her to be a pest in the past, but when they get stuck on a roof together, their views of one another start to change.While I didn't like this quite as much as the Bridgerton series, I still enjoyed this first book in the Rokesby series very much. Billie and George are perfect for each other, even if they don't realize it for quite a while and the two families are very interesting. I hope that we get to see something of Edmund (and Violet) as the series continues though they're not strictly Rokesby family members as well as more of Billie and George. 	 0

New Beginnings Phyllis is second novella in the Zimmerman Academy Shorts series by Kathi Daley. This is a spinoff of the Zoe Donovan series. This short story is told from Phyllis Kings perspective. The early chapters were originally included in several of the recent Zoe Donovan series books. Im looking forward the growth and changes in Phyllis life since joining the faculty at Zimmerman Academy and opening her home to Brooklyn Banks, Pepper Pepperton, and Eve Lambert. The novella ends with a mystery surrounding an unpublished manuscript. Phyllis friends, Hazel, Luke and Ethan explore a donated book written in 1956 and recognize women today experience many situations, frustrations and emotions as women did long ago. They, also, delve into the history of Ashton Falls formerly known as Devils Den. The day ends with an amazing birthday party for Phyllis surrounded by her friends.Kathi Daleys novella is a quick, enjoyable read which flows smoothly. Even in the novellas, the characters are well developed and the setting readily transports the reader into the world that she has created; one in which the reader feels as if they are visiting with friends. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted cozy mystery with lovable characters. I am looking forward to reading more books written by this author. If you have not had the opportunity to read Ms. Daleys books, be sure to become acquainted with each of her series (each uniquely themed and superbly written). In the interim, sit back and enjoy this is cozy mystery, perfect for those who appreciate a quick, well written novella. 	 0

Little disappointed that this keyboard is pretty much completely solar dependent. Yes it has a small rechargeable watch-type battery, but I guess we don't have enough light in our office to keep it charged.

Seriously, a watch battery as a backup power source?The keys are good quality, not completely thrilled with the slightly rounded bezel though (prefer the edges on the mac keyboards). 	 0

While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from "Martin Fierro,"  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate "come hither."  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of "All About Eve" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of "progress", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere. 	 0
Have been reading Carl Hiaasen novels off-and-on for years.  "Razor Girl" is somewhat of a sequel to "Bad Monkey."  All his plots take place in Florida; he is a Florida resident and a graduate of the University of Florida.Hiaasen's style is humorous, current and filled with characters and their development that make the read chuckle and laugh out loud.  Hiaasen's style is succinct, stylistic, and  creative.Have recommended Hiaasen to many friends over the years and have yet to have one say his books were not a great read. 	 0

Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his "dark form." One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection. If you're a fan of the show, character, or just love collecting figures, get this, it's a solid purchase! 	 0

This film is well worth the money and I'd say is without a doubt the best film I've seen in the last few years. At a high level it's about atoning for guilt for an accident that destroy's another's life. It doesn't seem possible, but through a lot of work and in this particular space the atonement is accomplished.Magnificent! I wish I could articulate this better because it is incredibly moving. 	 0

Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5" x 29.5", so not a small puzzle by any means.Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too. 	 0

BEAUTIFUL TRANSFER! Nice war time musical. Carmen shows her comedy side in this film and of course her over the top outfits! I won't go into the story line. If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The "STILL GALLERY" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE! I give it 5 STARS...the 'still' problem may be in MY COPY ONLY...(don't let this deter you from puchasing this film). A MUST HAVE for the CARMEN MIRANDA FAN! THANK YOU FOX!!! 	 0

I can understand where some people have problems with the instructions but it's important to understand what you are getting before you buy. I am using this with the TRS-80 and it's worked perfectly. It's not a camera, it's a camera with an excellent picture. The only thing I don't like is the microphone, I can't hear it at all. I'm not a very professional photographer but I like to try to use my camera with a camera that has better microphone.I bought this for a friend, but he does not like it.  I just bought a second one, and he is very happy with it.  I can't say enough about it, I am very happy with it, and I would recommend it to anyone.I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery.  I have a 10 year old who loves it, and I was very excited to get a charger that will last a long time, and I really wanted a charger that would last me longer.  I was very skeptical about the price, so I went with this charger, and it lasted a long time, I would say about a year or so.  It's not a deal breaker, but if you are looking for a rechargeable battery, and it lasts a long time, it's definitely worth the price.  I think you will be very happy with the quality of the charger.  I use it for several projects, and I would recommend it to anyone.This is a great product. It's very easy to setup. I've used it for about a month. It's a great little speaker. I've got it on my desk, and the 	 1
I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a piece of non fiction so much.  It reads like a novel, but a novel where I had a small part in the plot.  As a college student, I saw 4 out of these five films, probably in their opening weeks in NYC, I can clearly remember being aware that I was witnessing a change in the American cinema.  I remember the controversey that surrounded Bonnie and Clyde.  I Think I was routing for the Graduate at the Oscars, but having recently rewatched In the Heat of The Night, I can certainly say it has held up well. 	 0
If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The "problem" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Darfur-Now/dp/B0015XHR6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Darfur Now</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-History-and-Sociology-of-Genocide-Analyses-and-Case-Studies/dp/0300044461/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies</a> 	 0

Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.Was it perfect?  No, but it came close. 	 0

As someone who had ignored the whole "Harry Potter" fever that enveloped the literary world years ago, I fell in love with the magical movies. Now I'm reading the novels and finding out thing and filling in gaps I never knew. Its great to suddenly understand why X did this, or Q did that! For instance, in the movies I always wondered why Kreacher was in Sirius' house and why he was so awful! In the books you get more insight. 	 0

I love Sharon Shinn - this book is an example of what she's done for the sake of the other two authors. The book is a bit long, but it's a very enjoyable read.I had no idea that this book would be one of the most popular books in the world.  I found it to be the most entertaining.  I loved it.  It has great characters and plot.  I felt like I was in the story.  It's very realistic.  I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt, but I'm not sure why.  I'm sure it was because the book is so different from other books in the series.  I think it's because I have read the 	 1
Amazon saved me a bunch of money on this terrific radar detector.  It will drive you crazy with false alerts unless you disable "POP Mode".  Once POP Mode is turned off it stops falsing and it works as well as those $300 dollar (and higher) models.  I have been using it for a while now and it has saved me from many unpleasant experiences.  If you are looking for top of the line detection at under 200 bucks then this is your unit.  Take a look on-line and you will find that this baby has detection capability that rivals the heavy hitters (BEL and Escort). 	 0

great read, i love how the author kept the reader in the story. The author has a way with words. The reader will not want to put down until the very end. The story keeps you turning the pages. 	 1
I really loved reading this book.  I became  immersed in a foreign culture very dissimilar to mine in many of its strict gender behavior and religious expectations but, at the same time, composed of very human, very plausible characters with whom I could empathize.  Slowly getting to know the characters, piecing them together, and wondering who were the good and bad guys, all had me on the edge of my chair wanting to know more.  Particularly fascinating were the female characters and how each dealt with the constraints placed upon them in a society where a woman's sexuality is such a preoccupation that it has to be hidden and controlled, and where the males do not seem to generally take responsibility to control their own (although one of the main male characters was very sensitive to these issues and torn by guilt and angst by his own self-perceived transgressions against the true spirituality of Islam, and his desire to treat the woman he wanted with the highest regard).  Meeting strong women who wanted to develop themselves professionally in a male-dominated culture that generally blocked that from happening was refreshing and touched my heart.  I applauded them and those males who supported them, wishing to truly respect their intelligence and not exploit  or demean them (although there were those who did).  All of the characters were unique and very engaging, with the no-nonsense, dedicated and very wise investigator, Osama Ibrahim (was the name, Osama, chosen deliberately, to create a more balanced association with it?), being my favorite.  Also extremely fascinating was gaining entre into the desert environment, and modern man's attempt to master it and treat it as a wilderness adventure.  I highly recommend this mystery novel, one that stands out in a genre that has no short supply of reading choices. 	 0
This is one of my favorite books by the author. I will admit that I was a little nervous about reading this story. I am not going to tell you what to expect, but I will say that it is a good read. The characters are well 	 1

These clamps worked extremely well and have kept the tools in good working order for a very long time. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8-4 4-inch saws that I had in the past. I have had several of these saws for years and have used them with great success. I had to replace one with a Schlage saw because I had a problem with the wire holding it in place. I ended up returning the saw to the manufacturer for replacement. The new saws are much better and the wire holding them in place is much more secure. 	 1

Worked great but failed to heat after a year. Visually identical to one I bought at a "big box" store.  One of many cheaply made brands, usually constructed in foreign nations and imported.  This particular one failed like two others we bought because they use a mechanical thermostat that uses inferior materials for the electrical contacts.  After a year or so of constant use, the contacts form pits from the welding-like spark that takes place when the contacts separate.  Eventially the contacts are destroyed and the heater core fails to warm to the proper temperature.  It may never get warm or it may get too hot.Be forewarned: heater elements which glow red hot can ignite hair and cloth fibers that get sucked into the heater and cause fires.  Shut the fan off and clean it thorough if you smell the oder of burning hair or other burning smells. 	 0
I agree with the previous reviewer. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it.  It is well made and does not slip or crack.  I have no complaints about it, it is very well made and it is a great price.Very nice, great quality.

I bought this unit for the bedroom. I was looking for something that would work with my Ipod. This one does as advertised but only using the original Ipod cord.

This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside. This is not a toy your dog could play with inside if you were doing anything requiring your puppy to be quiet. 	 0

I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.I got the fuchsia cover. It looks much different on my computer monitor than it does in person. On the monitor it looks more like a rose pink, but in reality it's a super bright, neon pink. I love pink, but I don't want it to stand out THAT much. It's really, really bright.I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic "Pleather." It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.It's a great case.. really great, if you don't mind the plastic cover.  I am hoping that they will offer leather versions in the future, and more color choices. 	 0

When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her. 	 0
I own several Hibben products, but this one is by far the prettiest blade, its knife porn, the blade is a work of art and the handle deserves an Oscar! get my drift it is real purdy, but will it stand up to what it is made for? Yes and no, keep the work for this knife to light to medium work, skinning, small cutting jobs, it is not made to be bashed on top to split wood logs, I am sure it would take the abuse as stainless steel can take a real beating, I use it to cut food, skin game and fight zombies off! The sheath is nothing special, but it does hold the knife real well and seems well made, the 2 mods I made to this knife are, I polished the blade for that extra bing bling effect, and put an edge on top of the blade, it is a real killer now, ultra sharp before but now the top edge cuts as well, it makes for a great fighting/defense blade as it is compact and well balanced. I own many carbon blades that will do the heavy work around the camp site, but gladly carry this around for the smaller jobs.Get one, you will love it! 	 0
What a bargain for a solid, well-designed saw.  I love the laser guide, and it's easy to change blades.  For less than $35,the perfect kick-around saw to destroy!  Buy a better blade though.... 	 0

Cute idea and set up but the manufacturers packaging really stinks which just ruined it for me! Drum sticks and stand were tossed in loose around the actual drums that were wedged into cheap, flimsy plastic packaging. Drum sticks arrived extremely bent, to the point where it's awkward to actually hit them on the drums, which is a bummer because we bought this as a cheap starter set for our daughters birthday and now we have to hunt for new sticks so she can even play it before we can give it to her. 	 0

There was a nasty rumor that an island was going to be visited by aliens, and this one was a big part of the movie, but since the aliens were not in the movie, they just came to the island.I think it was a very good movie. The aliens seemed to have a lot of energy and it seemed like they were running around with a lot of energy. I just didn't care for it. But if you like the aliens, you will like this one.I love this movie. The acting is top notch, the story is well written, the movie is well acted and the action is well paced. The movie is not as big as the others, but still fun and entertaining. I recommend this movie for those of you who like action, action and adventure.You have to see this movie to really appreciate the good acting.

Maynard MA Former singer songwriter Sheryl Crow unveiled her ambitious plan to fight the double scourges of global warming and individual responsibility at the annual Lovers of Fatback and Other Pork Products Earth Day Symposium .Crow , who has not worn clothing publicly since abandoning her career as an airy acoustic folk rock balladeer in order to focus on her new life as a self satisfied celebrity scolder , sported what appeared to be a banana leaf purse attached to her rectum with hemp tubing ." I have been working on my idea quietly for some time now , and I ' m finally ready to bring it to the mainstream . As everybody knows , most people use paper to wipe their asses after a dump . Many people even go so far as to use enough tissue to thoroughly cleanse themselves . Well , those archaic days are done . My little friend here may look like an ordinary gathering pouch you might see hanging off your dying uncle ' s hospital bed , but I assure you it ' s much more than that . Women and men , I give you the Crowostomy Bag ! "Following the delighted crowd ' s enthusiastic gasps and sporadic shouts of , " You rock more than Bono ! " Ms . Crow explained the earth friendly design of her invention ." My thought process was that this design needed to be completely self contained and biodegradable . To that end , the Crowostomy Bag never needs cleaning or emptying . Rather , once the leaf based pouch has received enough waste , it sends a text message to your cell phone letting you know it ' s ready to be detached from the hemp tubing and added to your backyard compost heap . Benefit ? Well , get back to me after you harvest next year ' s vegetable garden ! "Crowostomy Bags will be sold in packs of twelve , and a percentage of each sale will be donated to Al Gore ' s presidential campaign .Harvard University , Dairy Queen , and the state of Oregon have already pledged to be TP free by 2009 . 	 1
platteville, ct just three days after residents gathered in the city's main square and emphatically vowed to save the historic orpheum theater from its scheduled demolition, sources confirmed friday that the community of platteville had lost all interest in the cause. local citizens, who reportedly took to the streets in protest when news broke that the 350 seat community theater would be replaced with a modern two story shopping center, are said to have, over the subsequent 72 hours, taken stock of the considerable time, energy, and resources that would have to be devoted to preserving the 80 year old theater, prompting most to quietly discontinue their efforts. " as soon as i heard they were going to tear down the orpheum, i joined the rally downtown and promised to do whatever i could to stop it but then after thinking about it for a little bit, i guess it started to dawn on me what that would actually entail, " said local woman eileen pearlman, who noted that while she had initially volunteered to help organize an awareness and fundraising campaign, she backed out of it the following day when she realized the commitment would end up occupying many of her nights and weekends. " the town came up with some really great ideas for saving the theater, like starting a petition and holding a demonstration on the steps of city hall, but to be honest, we never really got past the planning phase on any of them. " " don't get me wrong, the orpheum's a beautiful, classic building, and it needs our support, " pearlman continued. " it's just that this is all starting to look like a lot of work. " while townsfolk confirmed that an ad hoc " save the orpheum " committee was promptly formed tuesday morning following word that the theater was set to be razed, by that afternoon, sources said, such efforts were reportedly already showing signs of faltering, as many citizens'eagerness began to give way to concerns that they needed to get back to their homes or places of work. in particular, reports indicated that an attempt to have the orpheum certified as a historical landmark reached a dead end after several volunteer coordinators discovered that securing the legal status required filling out quite a bit of paperwork, which sources said " looked pretty complicated. " similarly, residents noted that an agreement to begin a mass newspaper letter writing campaign had only resulted in the drafting of a single letter to the editor, which as of press time had yet to be mailed to the platteville herald. according to sources, aside from making vocal statements such as, " this theater is part of our community " and, " it wouldn't be platteville without the orpheum " three days earlier, the vast majority of townspeople had made no effort whatsoever to forestall the iconic building's demise. " after i heard the news, i started going door to door to convince my neighbors to come out to next week's city council meeting, but that got tiring pretty quickly, especially when i realized how long it would take to reach everyone across the whole city, " 51 year old resident dennis michelson said. " the orpheum's definitely an important part of our town i used to see a christmas carol there every year with my family when i was a kid. look, i'd love to pitch in and help save it, but to tell you the truth, i've got a lot going on with work right now and there's a bunch of other stuff on my plate, so, you know. " " i heard they were talking about getting a kickstarter going, but i'm not sure what happened with that, " he continued. less than a half week after the community agreed to " keep the orpheum standing for another 80 years, " sources reported that each of the major initiatives to accomplish this goal including a neighborhood wide rummage sale, a march on the property developer's headquarters, and an effort to have regular community members star in one last production at the theater to raise money had yet to progress past even the most preliminary stages, and in most cases had not been elaborated on in any detail at all. municipal sources confirmed that, with not a single " our orpheum " t shirt manufactured nor a design even settled on, the playhouse's demolition would likely go through as planned later this month. " that theater's been around for generations, and i want my kids to grow up with it just like i did, but honestly, what can i actually do to help? nothing really, when you think about it, " said local business owner alex simmons, who admitted to reporters that, while the theater's had a great run, he couldn't remember the last time he actually set foot in the building. " the orpheum is a downtown icon, no question. but the thing is, we already have a nice movie theater, 	 1
Outer Space ( Reuterus Ass Mess ) : The International Space Sation ISS may become just another cheap and tacky sex tourism hot spot following reports that zero gravity orgasms far outshine anything achievable on earth .The news comes amid reports that the Hungaria born billionaire space tourist Charles Simonyi who paid 25 million for his for his 10 day stay on the ISS has said that the pubic and vagus nerves ' behave differently ' in zero gravity conditions .Simonyi said that on his two day journey to the ISS he felt relatively normal ' as if he was in a standard classy Park Avenue sauna on a Friday night . 'But when he stepped on board the space station Mr Simonyi said that a series of experiments including measuring the amount of testosterone he produced without the aid of hard core magazines or porny videos really shocked him by the intensity of the experience .The aim of his excursion was to help to generate an accurate picure of the station ' s potential as a holiday destination money spinner .Mr Simonyi began training for the flight six months ago at the Yuri Gagarin Hard Core wesbsite and at the Baikonur Cosmodrome ' s Madam Whiplash Steam Room Sauna in Kazakhstan .He underwent a gruelling physical programme , " including strict medical tests " to prepare him for the ride to escape the Earth ' s atmosphere and his body ' s natural physiological limitations during sex .His 25 million trip was arranged by US based Space Sex Adventures which has previously sent four private sex explorers to space .In 2001 US citizen Dennis Tito paid 2 million and reported pleasing orgasmic results aboard the ISS .Then in 2002 South African Mark Shuttleworth returned saying he had been ' relatively pleased ' altough a minor infection had blunted some of his pleasures .American Greg Olsen went up in 2005 and came down with a bump after acquiring a hernia following over exertions in zero gravity conditions .And in 2006 Iranian born US businesswoman Anousheh Ansari said the experience brought on a sudden and unexpected heavy period after her hormones went into overdrive at the thought of all those Russian cosmanauts aboard the ISS who unfortunaely for her turned out to be mostly gay .Lisa Nowak is 33 . 	 1
Prime Minister ' s question time was in disarray today after opposition leader Ian Duncan Smith persistently questioned Tony Blair on whether or not he regularly wore his wife ' s underclothing ." I put it to the house , " said Mr Duncan Smith , " that under the current government , NHS waiting times are up : that crime is up : that hidden taxation has risen at unprecedented levels : and that Tony Blair often parades about number ten in his wife ' s frillies . "In the ensuing uproar , it was two minutes before Mr Blair could answer these allegations . Standing gaunt and tired from his recent world sycophantic efforts , Mr Blair said : " Mr Speaker , it is simply untrue that NHS waiting times are up , and in real terms crime under this government has fallen steadily , as indeed has direct taxation . And on the subject of underwear , well , the right honourable gentlemen and his party are fine ones to talk . He stands before us now in a rather fetching Basque , and those rubber , thigh length boots are surely nothing to do with the rain outside . "Mr Duncan Smith remained unmoved . In his follow up question , he once again alluded to Mr Blair ' s involvement in the recent ' Cash for Skimpies ' scandal ." Mr Speaker , the Prime Minister will not bluff his way around the issues this time . I ask him to answer the questions , important questions to which the entire country demands answers : are NHS waiting times up ? Is crime up ? Is taxation up ? And where does Cherrie buy those skimpy crotch less silk jobs that the Prime Minister is wearing today ? "Again Mr Blair was forced to wait for calm . " Mr Speaker , I have answerer such questions many times before . The answers are , in terms that surely even he can understand , no , no , and no . And frankly , where Mrs Blair buys her underwear is not the issue . The issue is that last year the Tory government paid three million pounds in the purchase of K Y jelly alone : four million pounds in whipped cream and industrial strength rubber tubing : and cost the NHS a staggering six million pounds in surgical procedures to remove their genitalia from the various orifices of farmyard animals . "Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , spoke of his dismay at the proceedings ." Mr Speaker , I ask the Prime Minister why he persists in even bothering to answer such puerile questions from the honourable gentleman . Surely everyone can see that such back and forth questioning is nothing more than political point scoring ? Mr speaker , the two parties opposite would do well to concentrate on the issues of the underwear they ' re both blatantly incapable of dealing with anything of major importance . " 	 1
CLEVELAND , Ohio ? LeBron James has made basketball sound so difficult lately .Harsh words about the Cavaliers ' lack of effort , sense of entitlement , poor execution . The list goes on .A much simpler truth : It ' s easier to win when the ball goes in the hoop .The Cavs beat Milwaukee 115 100 on Thursday at The Q , avenging a double overtime loss to the Bucks on Saturday . James scored 27 points to go with nine rebounds and 6 assists .In that 108 105 loss to the Bucks , Cleveland was 17 of 27 ( 63 percent ) from the line . Add up the Cavs ' three losses this season ? which came by a combined total of 10 points , and they shot 39 of 64 ( 61 percent ) in those games .On Thursday , the Cavs were 24 of 30 ( 80 percent ) from the stripe , while James made 8 of 9 foul shots ." It ' s definitely the wrong angle because it ' s a make or miss league , " James said before the game , when this premise was raised to him . " You make free throws , I understand , that ' s something that should be fundamental , but it ' s a make or miss league . One thing you can ' t do is build wins and losses on whether the ball goes in or not . What you can build wins or losses on is how hard you ' re playing , how smart you ' re playing the game and how efficient and aggressive that you ' re playing the game . ?LeBron James says ' It ' s just how we need to play ' as Cavaliers defeat Bucks LeBron James talks following the Cleveland Cavaliers 115 100 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks at Quicken Loans Arena . Thursday , Nov . 19 , 2015 . Dave Andersen , cleveland . com" That ' s how you can build wins and losses , as far as making or missing , you can ' t build wins and losses for a long period of time on that . "It was the first time in five games that James failed to score 30 , which likely mattered little to him . He had to be pleased with his teammates ' effort . The Cavs collected 29 assists on 40 field goals and crushed the Bucks on the glass 43 22 .Also before the game , James perhaps recognized the level of harshness with which he ' s spoken lately and added : " I ' m not sitting up here saying it ' s Armageddon or anything like that . But we need to play better ball . Until we own that , we won ' t get better . "There are , of course , 70 games left in the regular season and neither Kyrie Irving nor Iman Shumpert has played a single minute ." I definitely wouldn ' t call it a crossroads , I don ' t think that ' s fair to the situation , if you know what I mean , " Cavs coach David Blatt said . " But you know , there are times during the year that you have to take stock and say hey , wait a minute , this needs to be better or this needs to be corrected . And this might be one of those times . "James and the Cavs played against the Bucks like they all understood that message . 	 0
A business " mind training " course using a newly developed drug has been set up at the Hiram Abiff Medical Research Unit in Bristol UK .It promises to ' help ' people who aspire to the legal and other professions including banking where institutionalized violence against one ' s fellow man is de rigeur . Many have found the fulfilment of their duties in these professions difficult at times . This course will banish all their worries .The intensive course promises its students the " complete removal of what is called " conscience " or any possibility of doubt concerning what is commonly viewed as " unethical behaviour " " .This , it is claimed , " will lead to greater personal liberty , autonomy and efficiency which will be a welcome boost to business and the economy " .Said Dr Rob Pike who devised the program :" We are simply inundated with enquiries from many professions , legal mostly , barristers , judges and the like but which also include the media , finance , the armed forces , MI6 and so on . The media are particularly interested and many journalists and editors have already signed up . It has been most encouraging . Our books are full for years in advance and we are currently looking to get government to finance the building of proper training centres to take care of the overload . We are very excited . I have been liaising closely with the U . S . administration who are very keen indeed . "Adam Crowley , chairman of Halsbury ' s Law Exchange that overseers advances in the administration of law said : " This could be the breakthrough we have all be waiting for since the halcyon days of the Nuremberg Trials .

washington, dc " greater love hath no man than this for great cola taste : that he should lay down his life for a new generation. " so reads the inscription at the base of washington, d. c.'s newest landmark : the united states cola war veterans memorial. a 60 foot high black granite sculpture honoring the advertising executives who lost their families and jobs in the most bitter advertising war in u. s. history, the cola war memorial was officially unveiled monday. " from 1983 to 1991, the u. s. cola war ravaged the american advertising industry, pitting agency against agency in a bitter struggle between coke and pepsi, " said onetime pepsi pitchman lionel richie at the memorial's dedication. " none who experienced the war can forget it, but we need this memorial to help us remember. " monday's ceremony was attended by thousands of cola war veterans, many of whom were overcome with emotion as they recalled their war experiences. " back in'89, i was stationed on madison avenue, between 53rd and 54th, " said veteran gene meacham, who served with saatchi saatchi from 1988 to 1991. " it was horrible. people were getting laid off left and right. one morning, i walked into the office, and roger, my copywriting partner on the'just for the taste of it'campaign, was gone, his desk completely cleaned out. he was fired in the blink of an eye. i was late for a strategy meeting. i didn't even have time to grieve. " even for those who went on to win promotions and climb the corporate ladder, the scars remain. " it was brother against brother, " said cola war veteran nathan mccune, now creative director for bbdo. " a lot of the people i graduated from wharton business school with in'83 were drafted by coca cola agencies, and i wound up serving with pepsi. there was always that paralyzing fear that you'd run into an old classmate at an annual beverage retailers'convention, and he would suddenly be the enemy. " for other veterans, the brutal, caffeinated war took an even greater toll : to date, more than 5, 000 veterans have been diagnosed with what doctors have dubbed " cola war syndrome. " " for years after the war, any time i went to the supermarket and saw those rows of two liter bottles, i was back there in the office, " said james pritchett, a homeless veteran who served with the lintas group from 1984 to 1990. " the jingles would start running through my brain, and i could smell the laser printer ink from the production office. suddenly, i wasn't in the grocery store anymore. i was in hell. " on top of their own suffering, many veterans still feel great bitterness toward the thousands of advertising executives who dodged cola war service altogether. in 1989, at the height of the war, some 1, 500 executives across the nation switched to other accounts, most notably cars and breakfast cereals. still others left the advertising industry entirely, finding work in public relations or consulting. while veterans from both sides of the cola war were moved and honored by the new memorial, controversy still remains over pepsi's decision to drop the uh huh bomb in may 1991. " they didn't have to do it, " said harvard university history professor arthur a. gould. " by all indications, the war would have been over within six months, anyway. " " when the marketing director announced the diet pepsi'uh huh!'campaign, a slogan of awesome power and catchiness backed by ray charles'high recognition factor, i was morally outraged, " said thomas rendell, a member of the diet pepsi creative team's inner circle during the war. " i told him,'we cannot do this. we can win the war by sane means.'but he was adamant, and in the end i had no choice. " seven years after the cola war's end, with the dedication of the new memorial, there is a sense among veterans that the wounds can finally begin to heal. " when you think about it, we weren't all that different. both sides really wanted the same thing : to sell carbonated, caramel flavored beverage products to the masses, " leo burnett ceo pat allaire said. on display at the base of the memorial are hundreds of letters written by those who fought in the war. among the many stirring testimonials is a letter written many years ago by a nameless, 21 year old copywriter who lost his job in the cola war. it reads : " i dream of a day when there is no coke, of a day when there is no pepsi. on this day, the people of the world will not be bitterly divided between two leading brands. on this day, there will be only one beverage, uniting us all : sweet, refreshing cola. 	 1
Ten Republican hopefuls took to the stage APIt was the night that former surgeon Ben Carson was expected to try and cement his front runner status within the Republican field , as the presidential hopefuls held their third debate .As it was , Mr Carson and Donald Trump , another outsider candidate who is second in the polls , found themselves taking something of a backseat , as other candidates sought to seize the occasion . A lot of the time they appeared to argue with the moderators and about their questions at the event at the University of Colorado in Boulder .Florida Senator Marco Rubio , who is third in most polls among Republicans , took the opportunity to take on his rivals , landing an early jab against his fellow Floridian Jeb Bush . ?Mr Bush , the state s former governor , tried to attack Mr Rubio for a poor attendance record in the senate , something that is partly the result of his presidential run .That s exactly what the Republican establishment says too , wait in line . Wait for what ? , he said when asked by a moderator why he was in such a rush to leave his work in the Senate . ?He added : The time to act is now . The time to turn the page is now .Mr Rubio also took a poke at Hillary Clinton , and the US media .You know , the Democrats have the ultimate Super PAC , it s called the mainstream media , Mr Rubio said . ?He mentioned an 11 hour hearing about Benghazi on Capitol Hill last week , in which Republicans grilled Ms Clinton about her conduct as secretary of state at the time of the attacks .It was the week she got exposed as a liar . But she has her Super PAC helping her out , the American mainstream media , he said .Mr Rubio spoke with passion , and a tally suggested he spoke for the longest on Wednesday night , second only to former business executive Carly Fiorina . Mr Bush spoke for the least amount of time . 	 0
close to a dozen countries, including the united states, announced tuesday they were expelling syrian diplomats in a coordinated move reflecting the international outrage about a massacre in the town of houla. a u. n. official said it's " clear " that syrian government forces were involved in the massacre, which left more than 100 people dead, nearly half of them children. a " fairly small number appear to have been killed by shelling, artillery and tank fire which took place over a period of more than 12 hours, " said rupert colville, a spokesman for the u. n. human rights office. should the u. s.'airdrop'millions of phones into syria? the majority appear to have died as a result of " summary executions " by " armed men going into houses and killing men, women and children inside, " he said. " what is clear is government forces were involved. they were shelling, using tanks and artillery. and it appears to be shabiha militia ( a government militia group ), entering houses and slaughtering people in what is really an abominable crime that took place throughout the day on friday. " syria has denied being behind the killings, insisting that " terrorists " carried them out. syrian officials said the government would investigate. the bloodshed continued tuesday, when at least 72 people were killed across the country, including nine children and two women, the opposition local coordination committees of syria said. syria said 21 " army and law enforcement martyrs " were buried. children shot, knifed, axed to death in syria's houla massacre, reports saythe netherlands, the united states, australia, great britain, france, germany, italy, spain, bulgaria and canada all announced tuesday that they were expelling some syrian diplomats. in some cases, it was just the ambassadors in others, numerous diplomats were expelled. he has been the top syrian envoy in the united states since the ambassador, imad moustapha, was called back to syria in october in a response move after the united states said it was pulling its ambassador out of syria. " we hold the syrian government responsible for this slaughter of innocent lives, " state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said in a statement tuesday. " this massacre is the most unambiguous indictment to date of the syrian government's flagrant violations of its u. n. security council obligations... along with the regime's ongoing threat to peace and security. " white house spokesman jay carney was even more emphatic. " this weekend's massacre is a horrifying testament to this regime's depravity. the international community is united in its revulsion at the regime's actions through both its military and its thug forces, and we are ratcheting up the pressure on and isolation of this murderous regime, " he said. sen. bob carr, australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement, " the syrian government can expect no further official engagement with australia until it abides by the u. n. cease fire and takes active steps to implement the peace plan agreed with joint special envoy kofi annan. " the spanish foreign ministry said it was declaring the ambassador persona non grata and expelling four other diplomats " for the unacceptable repression carried out by the syrian regime on its population. " but annan, envoy for the united nations and the arab league, took a markedly different tone after meeting with syrian president bashar al assad. while he said he " conveyed in frank terms the grave concern of the international community about the violence in syria, including the recent shocking events in houla, " he also said that syria's vow to organize its own investigations " is very encouraging. " he also said he " expressed appreciation for the cooperation of the syrian government, which enabled the u. n. to deploy an observer mission to syria, quickly. " " we are at a tipping point. the syrian people don't want the future to be one of bloodshed and division. yet the killings continue and the abuses are still with us today, " annan said, according to a statement released by his office. he said he appealed to al assad " for bold steps now not tomorrow, now to create momentum for the implementation of the plan. " " i also appeal to the armed opposition to cease acts of violence, " he added. talking to reporters in damascus, annan was asked what he thought would happen in syria if the peace plan was not implemented. " if the plan is not implemented, i would worry for the future of syria. i would worry about stability in the country.... if we don't ( implement the plan ), may god help us, " he said. " words are wonderful, but action is better. what is important is demonstrate through action a real commitment to the plan and this is what the international community is asking for now 	 0
Donald Trump ' s challenge to Russian hackers to find the dirt on Hillary Clinton has backfired as Wikileaks released hacked medical records damaging to both Clinton and Trump .The revelations that neither candidate is physically fit to run a lemonade stand are a blow to the American public already struggling with having to choose between the lesser of two weasels .A Russian going by LucceT 3 . 141 has claimed the hack . LucceT , as most media are calling the hacker , seems to have state sponsorship or at least protection within Russia .The hack and release of Trump ' s medical history also seems to be a warning to Trump not to anger Vladimir Putin , who has been favoring Trump up to this point . The rumors are that Putin will release Trump ' s tax returns if Trump displeases the Russian oligarch .The Trump FilesTrump has a long list of health concerns including high blood pressure , gingervitis , hemorrhoids , and at fourteen years old he suffered from lordosis and wore a back brace for two years . Interestingly , Trump ' s lordosis cleared up at the age of sixteen when he started buying fancy cars .But the most serious and disturbing health issues Trump faces are :Herpes Cephalitis : A virus that attacks the scalp , and eventually the brain leading to seizures and death .Bussitis Gibsonii : A recently identified form of Turret ' s syndrome , named after actors Gary Bussey and Mel Gibson . Caused by a lack of impulse control , often seen in strokes and head injuries , possible link to Herpes Cephalitis .Worms : Donald Trump is carrying several types of intestinal parasites and worms in his body , this may explain his popularity on fishing trips .The Clinton FilesHillary Clinton fared no better and had over a dozen dangerous health concerns , here are her most serious :Secretary Spread : Seen in sedentary office workers , the ass just keeps getting wider and wider . Attributed to Clinton ' s time as Secretary of State .Low Body Temperature : Often the sign of a cold heart .Demonic Possession : While technically not a medical condition it ' s bad regardless . Ted Cruz famously tried to exorcise Clinton in their only debate ever .Blogoshphere And Reporters Says No Hack OccurredSanjay Gupta , bloggers , and journalists with a sack , have all pointed out that the supposed Russian hack appears to be copied almost word for word from an episode of Dr Drew where he diagnosed the candidates .CNN has said it will investigate the plagiarism charges against the hacker LucceT in time for the general election , but for now needs to milk every nickel out of the health story that it can .Gupta , a neurosurgeon , had this to say about TV doctors :" There ' s something fishy about a TV doctor who diagnoses people just from seeing them on TV . Remember how Dr Drew said Charlie Sheen was psychotic and should be hospitalized ? We all know now that Sheen was just an asshole on cocaine . So I think we should all dismiss this kind of ' medical theater . ' " 	 1
Washington , DC Convinced that a man having to suffer ED was just as unbearable and unnecessary as a child having to suffer from ADD , a small group of scientists dedicated themselves to finding a cheaper and equally effective alternative to the chemically based clinically proven effective , Viagra . Late last month those dedicated men of science announced an astonishing breakthrough , concluding that eating watermelon will just as easily turn your ED suffering Wilbur Willie into a Mr Ed ." Who knew ? " said Oskar Myers , chief clinical scientist for " Search for a Cheaper Cure " . " It turns out that eating a watermelon a day makes you hung like a horse . Of course , there are some side effects . "Should you experience an erection lasting longer than four hours , Myers advises that you call up all your old girlfriends and invite them over to a poolside party and then attempt to seduce them into a full blown orgy where you are the porn star ." Do it tastefully though , " cautions Myers . " Try just exposing them to your profile at first , standing behind a silkscreen partition , casting only your silhouette . Use defused soft lighting . Stay away from a strobe light . Otherwise , you may frighten them off with the special effects . After all , as it is they will be experiencing enough mixed emotions when they get a peek of the size of your newly enhanced manhood . Besides it builds up intrigue and suspense and that still counts as foreplay . "Myers cautions eating too much watermelon may result in wanting to sow your wild oats into a furrowed field just because it is there and you can ." Let face it , " said Myers . " Unless you ' re suffering from a severe medical condition , trying to fake being straight to your girlfriend or wife , eating watermelon just to get to an extra slice of American pie is for old coots . The last thing your woman needs is you hot dogging her more than you already do for sex . "Although not a licensed marriage counselor , Myers recommends that males slow it down on and off the playing field .However , should you persist in enhancing your love life , Myers recommends going with certain verities of watermelons over others , as not all watermelons produce the same desired effects on everyone ." Just like a trip to any gym or pool shower room proves , " said Meyers . " Not all men are created equal . So you have to select the watermelon that is right for you . "For you uncommitted types or confirmed bachelors , Myers suggests that you go with a Seedless Watermelon rather than a Honeydew variety ." If you ' re not the cuddly , talkative type after sex and let ' s face it , what man is then I ' d stay away from the Honeydew , " said Myers . " It releases guilt inducing pheromones , causing you to stay talking afterwards , longer than you normally would . Sometimes up to a full minute just after having sex . " 	 1
KEY WEST , FL With a banana daiquiri in one hand and a jaw dropping blonde in the other , Republican vice presidential candidiate Jack Kemp yesterday unveiled his new " poolside " economic plan .Kemp explained that by focusing on hanging out and having a good time by the pool , the nation ' s upper middle class can help create more than five million trickle down jobs for lower class Americans by the year 2000 ." Each rich person ' s pool needs to be cleaned , supervised and attended to by a squad of valets , " Kemp told a crowd of reporters and giggling model actresses . " Those are very real jobs . And that ' s not even taking into account all the masseurs , bartenders and leggy houseguests with expensive tastes who would also be necessary for a good pool . "Kemp added that by lowering taxes on such items as margaritas , suntan oil and Hawaiian shirts , the U . S . will generate more than 5 billion in pool related federal revenue and increase the U . S . per capita good time index by more than 15 percent ." The first order of any economic plan is to encourage spending , " Kemp said as his feet were massaged by a team of Hispanic servants . " Enjoying a poolside lounge is a great way to do that . Mmmm . . . More pressure on the insteps , Carlos . "Republican Party insiders also point out the economic importance of getting a deep , dark , luscious tan ." With a great tan , you look good , and when you look good you feel good , " party strategist Jeffrey Edwards said from his pool beside his Lake Tahoe cabin . " And when you feel good , you feel like spending money . That ' s what ' s known as trickle down fun . "When questioned as to whether poolside economics would apply to the nation ' s wintry northern regions , Kemp laughed , saying , " What ? You ' ve never heard of an indoor pool ? "At Kemp ' s order , the reporter who asked the question was then " dunked " in the shallow end by a large group of bikini clad , tittering 19 year olds .Concluded Kemp : " More refreshments chop chop ! " 	 1
These Warriors had not suffered a loss in the regular season since April 7 , a total streak of 28 consecutive victories . Tied 103 103 at the end of regulation , then tied 110 110 at the end of the first OT the Celtics matched the Warriors to an extreme . It doesn t who the opponent is right now .ORLANDO , Fla . ? guard J . R . Smith found himself in the weird position this weekend of rooting for the team that beat him and his teammates in the NBA Finals . Many thought the streak would end on Christmas Day giving more hype to the upcoming Cleveland Cavaliers game . But our goal was always to get better each and every time we get on the floor . When you lose two or three in a row and when you have that edge and everybody is fed up with it , it s easier to grow as a team .Even with the Warriors falling to the Bucks , there is still plenty to see here relating to the league s most exciting team .The Bucks have really struggled this season compared to the success they had a year ago .Center Greg Monroe tallied 28 points and 11 rebounds for the Bucks , who looked surprisingly fresh after losing 90 83 in Toronto Friday .The Warriors fell just five wins shy of equaling the National Basketball Association all time record of 33 straight victories set by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1971 72 season . They played and they re going to continue to play at a high level .The Bucks also stopped the Lakers winning steak in 1972 . Paul George finished with 13 on 4 of 16 shooting , missing all four of his 3 point attempts .Saturday marked the final game of a seven game road trip for Golden State , a test so tough no team has ever emerged from a trip of that length without at least one loss . In addition to last year s Warriors , the Kansas City Royals also claimed a championship after starting the 2015 season with a MLB best seven straight wins .It had to come to an end sooner or later , Smith said .Obviously nobody wanted to experience that first loss and see how far we could take it but everybody is pretty proud of the accomplishment .It has been kind of a playoff feel just with the streak and all the media and attention around , Green said .I just told the guys that now we can have a regular season , said Green .Golden State thrives off a competition and from here on out expect this team get better and who knows maybe start a new streak . 	 0

In a bold move , BMW and Volkswagen are set to start to work through the world ' s surplus bubble wrap mountain to coat the inside of their next generation cars ." It makes sense to us , " said Brian McWilliams of Volkswagen . " We get paid to take this excess bubble wrap , and it makes the perfect safety system for cars . "The Bubble Wrap mountain has been growing for the past forty years since the invention of the packaging material in 1971 ." Bubble wrap makes a great packaging material , " said European Minister for Recycling , Tom Marto . " There are several different sizes , but it does not degrade . "All excess bubble wrap has been sent to a factory just outside Lyon in France , where it has been stored . Apart from the occasional storage facility manager extracting a sheet to pop the bubbles while they wait for another delivery , the pile has been growing . Now a use has been found for it ." There are still some areas of a car that could do with increased safety , " said McWilliams . " Airbags , for instance , are really dangerous . If one of those hits you , you know about it . We are going to wrap the airbags in bubble wrap . Also , the support struts of the car and the dashboard will be covered in bubble wrap for those impacts not severe enough to cause airbag deployment . Should the car occupants strike their head on a hard surface the bubble wrap will protect them from injury . It has the advantage that it is light , and adds virtually no weight to the car . "With two of the largest manufacturers making in roads into the bubble wrap mountain , the other car manufacturers are set to follow suit ." We reckon , " said Marto , " there ' s enough bubble wrap there to last fifty years . After that , we ' ll have to add it to the list of items we recycle off cars . " 	 1
OAK BROOK , IL More than 70 years after the opening of the first McDonald ' s , the world ' s largest fast food hamburger chain announced Thursday it may soon begin franchising its restaurants , which until now have always been wholly owned and operated by the McDonald family .Allowing outside franchisees to start up their own McDonald ' s restaurants would reportedly mark a sharp departure for the company , which since its founding has exclusively employed blood relatives and in laws of the McDonald family , both at its corporate offices and at each of its 34 , 000 locations worldwide ." For nearly three quarters of a century , every time someone has walked into one of our restaurants , their order has been rung up by a McDonald , " said company spokesman Doug McDonald , noting that he , along with each of his siblings and cousins , grew up in the family business and has remained with it ever since . " We can guarantee that every burger ever flipped at a McDonald ' s was flipped by a McDonald . "He added , " While we ' re proud of what our family members do personally serving 69 million customers in 118 countries every day we believe a different business model may be worth considering as we attempt to take our restaurant to the next level . "According to company records , McDonald ' s was founded in 1940 by brothers Maurice and Richard McDonald , who worked with their wives and children preparing and serving food at the chain ' s first 500 U . S . locations . As business boomed , they soon turned to an extended family of uncles , aunts , cousins , and grandparents to fill the thousands of jobs being created each year .Today , the massive food service retailer employs 1 . 8 million family members around the globe , including 500 , 000 McDonalds in the United States , 90 , 000 McDonalds in China , and 10 , 000 McDonalds in the Middle East .As the fast food chain expands the company added an estimated 62 , 000 brothers in law to its workforce in 2012 numerous McDonalds have said that the current growth rate is unsustainable without permitting franchisees to open new locations and hire non McDonalds as workers ." The world is changing , and frankly we ' re running out of family members who speak Mandarin , " said Xaoili McDonald , a shift manager at a location in Beijing . " There just aren ' t enough McDonalds living in China to staff all our restaurants , and trying to get our relatives to move over here and learn the language is next to impossible . Especially when you consider we pay people a lot less in developing nations . "" Just ask my cousin Juan McDonald in Guadalajara , " she added .But many family members have said the idea of franchising McDonald ' s locations to outsiders is simply unthinkable .Jessica McDonald , a 63 year old drive thru attendant from Massachusetts , told reporters she wants to keep things the way they were when she was young and all McDonald children accompanied their parents whether they were board members , marketing directors , fry cooks , or dishwashers to work to learn the family business firsthand .A final decision is expected to be made next month at a meeting of the company ' s top executives , a group including CEO James McDonald , president Ken McDonald , executive vice president Ross T . McDonald , human resources chief Janet McDonald Harris , president of Latin American operations Maria Isabel Arroyo y Ram rez de McDonald , and retiring chairman Milt McDonald ." Whatever the outcome , McDonald ' s always has and always will be a family oriented business , " James McDonald wrote in his annual letter to the 483 , 970 shareholding members of the McDonald family . " Though we ' re not used to seeing a person we ' re not related to behind the counter , rest assured that whoever is there will always greet us in a uniform bearing those same golden arches our grandparents wore . "" That ' s the McDonald ' s way , " he continued . " And I should add that if the recent runaway success of the Chili family is any indication , franchising could really be a huge thing for us .

ATHENS , OH Planning ahead to ensure he is adequately prepared for life after college , Ohio University senior Kyle Huber confirmed to reporters Monday that he already has an excruciating 14 month employment search lined up and waiting for him when he graduates this spring .The marketing major stated that , far from exiting school without a clear direction or goal in mind , he has prepared himself to " hit the ground running " right away with a prolonged , demoralizing , and desperate job hunt ." Once I get my diploma this spring , I ' m pretty much all set to begin this new , dispiriting chapter in my life on the right foot , " said Huber , who confirmed that he already has firm plans to move to a city where he ' ll live with five roommates in a small apartment while hopelessly chasing down leads on unappealing dead end positions he isn ' t qualified for anyway . " I ' ve even gotten a head start by setting up a bunch of informational interviews so I can begin to build up a network of contacts who won ' t be able to help me find a job . "" As far as my bleak , angst ridden post graduation life goes , I think it ' s safe to say I have things all nailed down , " he added .The 22 year old stated that his preparations will allow him , come May , to " dive right in " to fruitless tasks such as scouring online job listings , endlessly revising a r sum no one will ever look at , and submitting 10 to 20 job applications every day to which he will never receive a single reply , positive or negative . Huber added that he is " way ahead " of his classmates in terms of planning for his upcoming unemployment , noting that many of his peers have not yet even begun to think about how they will struggle and fail to secure a source of income upon leaving college .According to the diligent , proactive student , he has already arranged to meet with disinterested alumni from his school working in barely relevant fields , friends ' parents who hardly know him , and career counselors who will probably just direct him toward unpaid internships that , after having applied , he will frustratingly learn are only open to those still attending college ." I even have a start date May 12 set for my employment search , which means I ' ll have to jump right into it without missing a beat , " said Huber , claiming that his undergraduate years have more than equipped him to handle the 40 hours per week of tedious perusing that his dismal job hunt will require . " Luckily , I already have some experience humiliating myself in front of potential employers at college job fairs , so I won ' t be a complete novice . "" Given the amount of thought and preparation I ' ve put into this , I definitely feel ready to head out there into the real world and start receiving hundreds of curt , dismissive responses from companies telling me no positions are available , " he added .Huber remarked that with three or four halfhearted , uninformed letters of recommendation under his belt already , he believes he has all the false hope he needs to get him through the next couple years . But should he lose interest as the long months go by , Huber reported that he won ' t be afraid to take a trip back to his college ' s career center , beg for more help , sit through a vapid seminar on how to " nail " an interview , and spend the better part of an afternoon idly browsing through job pamphlets and wondering what more he possibly has to do ." And it ' s not like I ' m going into this punishing nightmare of nonstop employer rejection without a backup plan , " Huber said . " If I feel it ' s not for me , I have plenty of other options . Say I decide I want to pursue an advanced degree solely as a stalling maneuver amid the agonizing and unending search for work and not because I have any interest in the subject whatsoever that ' s still 100 percent on the table . For now , though , I ' m just focusing on pouring myself into the 14 month living hell awaiting me this spring . "" And who knows ? " he continued . " I don ' t want to speak too soon , but it ' s definitely something I could see myself sticking with for the next few years or maybe even longer . " 	 1
There was better news today for the ex Toon hero Kevin Keegan when , after having resigned from the Newcastle United manager ' s job last week , he was offered a new job : Holding Joey Barton ' s Coat .Barton , still a player at United , albeit with a six match ban , is a rabble rouser , a trouble causer , a bit ' handy ' , pushy , a ' lad ' , good with his fists . . . temperamental , know what I mean ?He regularly gets into fights , and is always in need of someone to ' hold his coat ' .The last time Barton got into a ' scuffle ' , it ended in a jail sentence , and prior to that , he left Man City team mate Ousmane Dabo with his face ' caved in ' . On both occasions , he was wearing a jacket , and believes he could have done so much more damage had he had a ' second ' to hold his apparel for him .Ex boss Keegan regarded himself as something of a father figure to Barton at Newcastle , defended him in front of the Newcastle board , and stood by him when he emerged from the nick recently . Now King Kev is to support the lad permanently as he follows him around , waiting for him to explode .The job is Full Time , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 52 weeks a year . You get the idea .Said Keegan :" I ' m lookin forward to it . He ' s a nice lad , wears his heart on his sleeve , but there ' s nuthin wrong with that . He ' s got a fiery temperament , but he gives it his all , and you can ' t ask for anythin more than that . " 	 1
Scientists have gained a shocking new insight into the Caldera supervolcano which rumbles beneath Yellowstone national park . They say it could blow in less than 15 years .If so , it means the USA ' s widely condemned decision to shun ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , along with the dissatisfying outcome to the 2009 Copenhagen conference last year was the right one . If it erupted , then the ash emitted would cause a worldwide drop in temperatures by blocking the Sun ' s light , akin to a nuclear Winter .Provided US scientists are right , then all climate change efforts are largely irrelevant . The Caldera is , in effect , a silver bullet solution . By erupting , it would completely reverse global warming . The earth would take over 100 years just to reheat to present levels , thus present global warming fears are unwarranted .Vulcanologists claim it is 70 likely to erupt within two decades , and 65 likely within 15 years . The US president has taken the claims seriously , and has set up an early warning evacuation and relocation system , while other plans attempt to mitigate its effects .All residents would have to leave the Mid West and relocate to either the East or West Coast . A 1500 mile wide threat zone has been identified , which is designated a no go area , for all but military personnel and specialist scientific investigators .If the caldera were to explode , then the USA would only have capacity to maintain 20 of its current food production . Obama has also initiated plans for a food stockpiling programme sufficient to feed 280 million Americans for five years . McDonalds is in talks currently , but there will be many , many food producers and sellers involved , Obama stressed , in a nod to Burger King , no doubt intended to placate them .Scientists say citizens will have a window of about three months , perhaps slightly more , to make plans and move . Japan and China have offered to accommodate up to 5 million Americans each , while Europe is expected to house about 20 million . This leaves about 40 million still in need of relocation , and it is thought these people will split evenly between the West and East Coast , with up to an additional million setting up a new life in Alaska . Scientists continue to monitor the situation , and hope to have more detailed analyses and eruption forecasts in the near future . 	 1

mr ohashi shindo was arrested last night for murdering his wife's virtual boyfriend whom she had created at the dating website, returntothebattleforbloodroyalesothatwecannolongerloveyou. webms haruka shindo created her perfect man and called him akirasan who had the face of a fish, the body of a sumo and the legs of an ostrich. he was never late. he never spoke back. he could cook and clean. he put the seat up when taking a slash and always cleaned around the toilet bowl. he made his wife breakfast in the morning and drove her to work. he put the lid off the colgate back on the toothpaste after he had cleaned his teeth. he could speak perfect english and say'you're right dear, i am so sorry,'without appearing to be the least bit insincere. he was tidy and also did his ironing and also did the washing up and the drying up. he was ceo of a successful family in mafia wars with a network of 2323 members and an empire stretching from italy to cuba to brazil and las vegas. he was also a successful farmer and had a huge farm on farmville. akira was big in the virtual universe and was obviously going places. have you ever met a man like this? no and that's why he looks like a fish. ms shindo spent hours and hours with akirasan, so much so that she never spoke to her real husband in real life and kept texting messages to her virtual guy who miraculously replied to them all. on 9th july at 3 : 30am mr shindo arrived home early from his work as as a seamstress to find his wife moaning and groaning in from of the computer which had the picture of her anime vitual guy doing the same back to her. mr shindo felt insanely jealous when his wife told him he was leaving him for akirasan and that they were going to get married. and what was he going to do about it? the jilted hubby hacked into the japanese website and deleted all of akirasan's files and erased all data concerning the virtual boyfriend. and not only this. he sent an email to zynga saying that akirasan no longer wanted to play mafia wars or farmville because he was in fact dead and could they please erase all informtion about akira's mafia empire and farm conglomerate? they complied and akira was demoted to level one in both games and thousands of hours of game time akira was level 23, 453 in both games was lost forever and forever. so, haruka suddenly found herself alone in the world. her virtual guy had been murdered and she was no longer the heiress to a virtual fortune. how bad could her day get? even worse actually since the jealous husband killed off his wife's virtual children there were ten of them and slaughtered all her neo pets by starving them to death. bereft, alone and hysterical with grief, haruka shindo phoned the police who arrested her husband for mass murder and wilful destruction of a virtual empire. mr shindo has been released on bail with the condition that he cannot approach a computer or switch on a mobile phone or go anywhere in the world which has satellite coverage. you guessed it he was been lowered to the bottom of the marianas trench in the pacific which is 10, 000 metres deep. his trial date is january 23rd, 2014 and let's just hope he doesn't drown by then. could ms shindo's day get even worse than than it already was? yes, because it transpired that mr shindo was bisexual and had also been dating akirasan. mr shindo had mortgaged the shindo house to buy one trillion virtual dollars so that he could play zygnga poker all day and all the night and all through the next life. as of current time of writing, ms haruka shindo can be found at zonia. ru doing silly things in front of a webcam. and at some point in future it's a fair bet that her husband will surf on in and request virtual sex with her if he somehow manages to surface from the bottom of the pacific without exploding, that is. for yet more shameless marketing see another day a short story with a twist in its tale. the first two paragraphs are below. today i was sitting at my computer when all of a sudden a fish came flying in through the window. i live on the 134th floor of a skyscraper and i went to my window to see where the fish had come from. i then got a call asking if the fish was okay and i replied that i thought it was. the phone went dead and as i went to the balcony i felt a blinding flash and saw stars. the phone rang again, and the voice on the other line asked if it was okay to shoot 	 1
detroit emphasizing that its workforce and facilities were just waiting for the go ahead to start up production, the city of detroit pleaded with the american people tuesday to just give it something anything at all, really to manufacture. mayor mike duggan, addressing reporters on behalf of a municipality where the unemployment rate remains above 10 percent, repeatedly asserted detroit's willingness to turn raw materials into finished products of any kind, be they plastic goods, textiles, electrical equipment, industrial supplies, metal products, paper, chemicals, heavy machinery, biomaterials, processed foods, or something else entirely. " the city of detroit is eager to build anything and everything for the american people seriously, whatever you guys want, " said duggan, who recently sent a press release to thousands of ceos nationwide explaining that tens of thousands of employees and many millions of square feet of industrial space in the city are " ready to go at a moment's notice, so just let us know. " " people need tables, don't they? we'll make tables, and we can do chairs, too. or dishwashers, concrete blocks, farm implements you name it. say the word and we'll start churning'em out. " " we can even do weapons, " he continued. " we'd be happy to do weapons. want weapons? " we could also just put stuff in boxes. we don't care. or just give us the green light, and we'll knock down whatever buildings you need and put in those big wind turbines. everybody needs energy these days, no question about that. " duggan then spent approximately 12 minutes naming products detroit could make, a list that included but was not limited to sailboats, commercial printing presses, memory foam mattresses, household appliances, lotion, file servers, industrial solvents, suction cups, backyard meat smokers, pharmaceuticals, hooks, machine tools, glue, artificial knees, bonded lubricants, aerial radar systems, cushioned insoles, shipping containers, sporting goods, pillow shams, dried pasta, packaging materials, shower curtains, shower curtain rings, shower curtain rods, hinges, laminate flooring, board games, pneumatic hoses, hydraulic winches, novelty ice trays, drywall, handbags, and cigarettes. pulling out his cell phone and guaranteeing the assembled press corps that he could get people started on any of these projects within the hour, the first term mayor told the nation to just go ahead and send his office the schematics for whatever they need and the rest can be sorted out later. he then quickly added that if they didn't have any schematics, that was okay, too, saying that as long as they had a vague idea of what they were looking for, " detroit can get it done, no problem. " " you know, we're not really married to the name motor city anymore, either, " said duggan, claiming that detroit would gladly become " ladder city or " deck sealant city if need be. " i was just talking with some residents the other day about how we could easily become the pool supply capital of the world. there are thousands of pools in the united states, and they each need to be cleaned, right? we could make the chlorine, or the pool skimmers, or that long vacuum thing that sucks stuff off the bottom, or those big covers that go over the pools when it's winter and they're not being used all right here in detroit. " " we're not picky, " he added. shortly thereafter, duggan was seen grabbing both sides of his lectern and lifting it several inches into the air while exclaiming that, if given the word, he could have 500 lecterns just like it made up by next monday. the mayor, appearing visibly flushed and perspiring, then looked around at those in attendance, pointed to individual reporters one by one, and asked them if they needed any extra tape recorders or " those lanyards you're always wearing. " " hey, if you don't need anything built but have some stuff you want painted or sanded or fireproofed or something, we could do that instead, " said the mayor, his voice steadily rising as he strained to maintain a wide smile. " we could also just put stuff in boxes. we don't care. or just give us the green light, and we'll knock down whatever buildings you need and put in those big wind turbines. everybody needs energy these days, no question about that. or maybe we could make the whole city into one big 140 square mile organic farm. those seem pretty popular, right? is that what you want? fine by me just tell us and it's done.

Amidst the number of rock and roll guitarists in the world , between Bruce Springsteen and Chuck Berry , beyond Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin , there are 2 famous rock musicians , relying mostly on their pianos Billy Joel and Sir Elton John .Billy Joel , an alcoholic and native New Yorker , is known for his hit song , " Piano Man " , and over in London , Sir Elton John is known , not only for his hit song " Rocket Man " , but for being gay .

KHARTOUM , Sudan Rebels aided by South Sudan bombed an oil pipeline in the disputed district of Abyei , a Sudanese army official said on Thursday ." At 9 p . m . on Wednesday , a group belonging to the Justice and Equality Movement . . . aided by South Sudan launched an attack , specifically . . . into Sudanese territory , " said Al Sawarmi Khalid , the Sudanese army ' s spokesperson , in a statement to the semi official Sudanese Media Center ( SMC ) ." This renegade group was given technical support from the South Sudanese military which enabled it to bomb an oil pipeline in the area of Ajaja inside the administrative borders of Abyei , " the statement continued .According to Khalid , a fire stemming from the bombing lasted for several hours , " but it has been put out and the pipeline is now being repaired . "On Saturday , Sudanese President Omar al Bashir ordered the shutdown of pipelines carrying South Sudanese oil through Sudan , accusing South Sudan of supporting rebels in Sudan .South Sudanese military spokesperson Philip Aguer could not be reached to comment .A statement by the The Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , however , denied involvement in the attack . " The Justice and Equality Movement did not bomb the pipeline between the Difra oil filed and Heglig , " the statement read .JEM refuted the allegation that it receives support from South Sudan and said it does not have any presence in Abyei .Instead , JEM accused the Sudanese government of not being able to carry out its plans with shutting the flow of South Sudanese oil , and of being was responsible for the blast ." Since the regime was not able to implement this decision , it came up with a ridiculous scenario of bombing the pipeline between Difra and Heglig and then accusing JEM of responsibility , " the group said .South Sudan became independent from Sudan in July 2011 , following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead . But the two nations have remained at odds on some issues , including defining their borders and oil exports .When they separated , South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan ' s oil reserves . The two countries have been at odds about how much landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north .In January 2012 , South Sudan shut down the production of oil and in April as both countries nearly slipped into all out war .In September 2012 , under international pressure , the leaders of both countries signed a cooperation agreement that addressed their unresolved issues , and in March 2013 , both sides agreed to resume oil production . 	 0
Next month , U . S . President Barack Obama will become the first sitting American president to visit Myanmar , the strongest endorsement yet of the country ' s efforts to tread a path to democracy .Q A : What ' s behind sectarian violence in Myanmar ?Obama ' s visit will come at a time when Myanmar is in the news again but not for the right reasons .Violence between Rohingya Muslims and local Buddhists continues in Rakhine state in the west of the country . The United Nations says at least 89 people have been killed in the past two weeks and 110 , 000 are displaced . Some aid organizations are questioning whether now is the right time for Obama to add legitimacy to the government of President Thein Sein .But there ' s no denying a lot has changed in the past year and a half .Read more : Aung San Suu Kyi has " soft spot " for the military generalsSo far , a quasi civilian government has been sworn in , although the military still holds great sway . Hundreds of political prisoners have been released , ceasefires have been signed between the government and some but not all ethnic groups . Political and economic reform is well underway . Another change that didn ' t make headlines but has been clear to us during numerous trips over that 12 month period is the attitude of the Burmese people .Last year , very few people would speak to us on camera or in some cases even off camera for fear of retribution . Decades of brutal military rule turned freedom of speech into a luxury most could not afford .Aung San Suu Kyi : Peaceful freedom fighterBut just four months later , during a bi election in which the freed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won almost all seats , caution was thrown to the wind and celebrations were passionate and unrestrained .Thousands of jubilant Suu Kyi supporters spilled into the street , holding posters of the woman who had spent much of the past two decades under house arrest these were scenes which just a couple of years earlier would have ended in arrest and imprisonment .U Myint Maung , a man from Yangon , had a simple explanation of the election . " The people were living in prison . Aung San Suu Kyi held the key to open the door , " he said .We , as journalists , were welcomed and thanked on the streets as if the fact we were there documenting these changes meant they could never be reversed .Read more : Myanmar eases restrictions on news organizationsBut not one person we spoke to over many months said their lives had physically improved . They were more hopeful and believed democracy was now possible but they were still struggling to survive .Daily life is hard for many Burmese . A country that was one of the richest in Asia 50 years ago is now one of the poorest . Authorities are struggling to shore up institutions and update laws to protect people and resources from hungry international investors snapping at Myanmar ' s heels .The ethnic unrest in Rahkine state has tested the efforts of President Thein Sein ' s administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar ' s different ethnic groups .There ' s no doubt that some changes in Myanmar have been swift and Sein deserves the international praise he is receiving . But the transformation from pariah to ally is not complete and the skeptics among us worry it could yet stumble . 	 0
Washington , DC Leisure Times The President Elect , Barack Hussein Obama I , says his job is " over " , and now he needs " time to rest ! " Obama made the statement at a national news conference after he turned the day to day running of the country over to " The Clinton Coalition " who he had just appointed to all meaningful positions in the faltering country ." I ' ve done what I set out to do , " the President pronounced forcefully , " get elected despite overwhelming odds , and now I am in a position where I am completely over my head , and exhausted . I have done my duty to my party , and now it is " MY TIME " for CHANGE , and a chance to " Get Down " and relax . Besides , " he added , " I got 30M to burn up in my left over campaign fund ! "Staffers said Obama would be taking an advance on his approved sick day allowance , and would be able to make up the days during his " second term . "A White House Travel Spokesman said the President and a few friends had rented a mile of pristine beach front on Hawaii along with 7 private mansions to recuperate over " the holidays " , a non sectarian explanation of that vanishing pagan tradition of " Christmas " , and then he would be off to Africa , where he would be broadcasting live on the new Oprah TV network .Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Obama had volunteered to do her job for her , so she could concentrate on raising funds to pay off her campaign debt of 7 . 5 million before her real estate investments were foreclosed , and her new wardrobe was repossessed . Staffers also said , she was relieved because " she really doesn ' t like to negotiate with black people . "Among Obama ' s Safari plans were to check in with all of Africa ' s Dictators , and along with Barney Frank , investigate why America ' s humanitarian funds were disappearing from state controlled banks . Frank would be on hand to issue immediate American Taxpayer Bailouts and shore up consumer confidence among all starving and diseased Africans .The bailouts would be in honour of Obama , Sr . who had left offspring scattered all over the Ivory Coast , now officially declared " Obama Land " by the UN . 	 1
WASHINGTON ( FMLIVEWIRE ) The US Congress approved the 787 billion economic stimulus bill on Friday sought by the Obama administration , with the proviso that the money will first be wired to special Nigerian offshore accounts as recommended by senior Congressional Democrats .The congressional debate featured hysterical denunciations of the stimulus bill by Republicans particularly in the House of Representatives . One congressman waved the current issue of Newsweek magazine , which carries a cynical cover story headlined , " We Are All Socialist Scammers Now . "Yet the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and nearly every business lobby endorsed the stimulus bill , as corporate America and Nigeria expect to cash in on government contracts , business tax cuts , or to just plain take the money and run .The billions of dollars will be wired to untraceable accounts held by a " Mr Owmanungo Bansanbunko " at the Bank of Nigeria for processing in order to obtain certain tax advantages before being routed back to the USA through the Cayman Islands , explained Nancy Pelosi ." I received a wonderful email offer from Mr Bansanbunko , " said Pelosi . " He is a fine , upstanding man whose wife has leukemia . "The stimulus bill is the largest single appropriations measure ever enacted by Congress . It represents an attempt by the Obama administration to buy time and forestall an immediate collapse of consumer spending and economic activity , while further measures are prepared to bail out the big financial interests .Despite the right wing denunciations of the bill as " a socialistic Nigerian scam , " it actually represents an effort to prop up the capitalist system through an expansion of federal government spending with shady offshore Nigerian accounts , said Rush Limbaugh .Copyright Felix Minderbinder Live Wire 	 1
in 2009, we wrote a book, " 40 more years : how democrats will rule the next generation. " building on ruy teixeira and john judis'2002 tour de force " the emerging democratic majority " predicting the 2008 election, we argued that america's diversifying and increasingly liberal youth voters would secure a lasting democratic majority. our collaboration seemed appropriate then and is only more so now. on one half of the byline, you have james carville, 68 year old white man from louisiana and professor at tulane university. on the other side, you've got a 26 year old second generation latina with a fianc e. voters who look like james are on their way out voters like rebecca are our future. a few reviewers missed the point of our focus on demographics. others, primarily young, entitled, progressive men, critiqued us for not recommending that democrats focus on appealing to young, entitled, progressive men. to this, we plead guilty. our book was about demographic diversity and the future of the democratic party. politics : what the election teaches us about ourselvesafter the midterm elections in 2010, we were mocked viciously. our thesis was laughable, republicans hooted, ignoring the book's careful caveat that midterm election turnout differs substantially from that of presidential elections. we would like to direct these critics to the epistle of jude, 1 : 10 : " yet these men speak abusively against whatever they don't understand and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals these are the very things that destroy them. " tuesday night proved our 2009 selves could not have been more right. " mid 20th century, white men made up half of the electorate, " we wrote in 2009. " in 2008, white men made up only 36 of the electorate... and their vote share is dropping by a percentage point a year. " our only error was in slightly underestimating the rate at which white men's vote share is shrinking. white voters were 74 of voters in 2008 they were 72 this year. white men comprised just 34 of the electorate on tuesday. politics : the new american electorate has arrivedin 2009, we also commented on the republicans'reliance on the far right and evangelical voters : " the shrinking christian right leaves a void in the republicans'collection of base groups and they can't look to any growing groups to replace those votes. " mitt romney outperformed sen. john mccain, the 2008 gop presidential candidate, by 5 points with both white voters overall ( 59 ) and white men ( 62 ). he also bested mccain's margin among republicans, winning 93 of self identified republicans as compared to mccain's 90, and white evangelical voters, 79 compared with mccain's 73. romney lost by relying on a tapped out, ever shrinking group of voters. by way of contrast, latinos now make up a greater share of the electorate than they did four years ago : 10 of all voters. obama won 71 of latinos, reflecting an increase in support of 4. similarly, the proportion of the electorate identifying as asian increased from 2 to 3, and obama's support among asian voters rose 11 points, from 62 to 73. there's an entire chapter in " 40 more years " on the importance of youth voters. four years ago, 18 of the electorate was between 18 and 29. now, youth are 19 of voters. we highlighted a critical trend within the youth vote : " back in 1972, almost nine in 10 youth voters ( 87 ) were white. by 2004, only 62 of youth said they were white. " this year, about 58 of voters 18 29 identified as white 42. 1 of youth self reported as african american, latino, or otherwise nonwhite. opinion : how gop can attract latino voterswe also predicted the implosion of republicans'culture war strategy. our conclusion was that " w hat bush started in 2000 was a two election trick that had met its natural and timely death by 2008. " our critics tried to answer our claim by citing the success of culture war tactics in 2004 and their state level effects in 2008. we ignored them. as we said, " the consequence of republicans'lingering preoccupation with the culture war is that it has led them to become a party of ridiculous positions. " republicans would " have to be certifiable, " our sage selves circa 2009 warned, to ever try a culture war strategy again. we could not be more delighted that maine, maryland and washington became the first states in the country to pass same sex marriage by popular vote on tuesday. what we're downright thrilled about, however, is the fact that mitt romney got fewer votes than " traditional " marriage in every one of those states. the republicans did their damnedest to use the specter of homosexual marital bliss to incite their base voters to 	 0
geneva, switzerland according to a study released monday by the united nations economic and social council, 4. 2 billion people a full 70 percent of the planet's inhabitants could use an all star benefit concert. " whether ravaged by war, disease, natural disaster, or just plain grinding poverty, there are a whole heck of a lot of people out there in desperate need of a star studded fundraiser at madison square garden, " ecosoc president martin belinga eboutou said. " or, if not that, a quincy jones produced remake of'what's going on'featuring everyone from p. diddy to'n sync to u2's bono. " belinga eboutou pointed to the recent success of concert for new york city, a five and a half hour extravaganza featuring such superstars as elton john, mick jagger, backstreet boys, paul mccartney, and destiny's child, among others. earnings from the benefit, which aired on vh1 and will soon be released as a double disc cd, are expected to surpass the 150 million raised in last month's all star america : a tribute to heroes telethon. " if we could get something like that going in the 315, 583 places on the globe the u. n. has identified as'in crisis,'we'd really have something, " belinga eboutou said. belinga eboutou cited gujarat, the indian state where a january earthquake killed an estimated 100, 000 people and left nearly one million homeless, as an example of a region that could use a night of star studded " compassiontainment. " " if jerry seinfeld could see it in his heart to toss off a few of his trademark observational one liners for the needy people of gujarat, it would greatly alleviate the suffering they have endured, " belinga eboutou said. " and the rock stylings of a reunited who would be much appreciated, as well. " last week, the u. n. established an exploratory committee to begin the arduous task of assigning stars to the world's trouble spots. however, with the ratio of needy locales to bankable stars standing at 4, 390 to 1, an estimated 800 two hour concerts per celebrity would be required over the next year to set things right in the world. these figures are also contingent upon no further natural or man made catastrophes occurring during that time period. though only in its initial stages, the deployment of stars has already begun. last week, r b sensation pink was dispatched to indonesia to raise money for the families of the 350 asylum seeking refugees who drowned in an overcrowded boat last month, while arista recording artist dido is slated to perform nov. 27 in war torn macedonia. in addition, the'80s new wave band soft cell has agreed to reunite for three december shows in aids ravaged south africa. new york concert promoter ron delsener, who is in talks to organize more than 22, 000 relief concerts on behalf of the u. n., said the logistical problems such a humanitarian effort would present are considerable. " there just aren't any adequate venues for, say, an ozzy osbourne show in sierra leone, " delsener said. " no stadiums, no arenas, not even a large auditorium. and have you ever tried tracking down a pyrotechnics expert with a union card in sub saharan africa? it's practically impossible. " delsener also noted that the cost of providing adequate security at such a concert would be greater than the gross national product of the nation in need. despite such challenges, third world leaders are urging musicians to do whatever they can. " it is up to each and every star to pitch in, " said nicaraguan president jos arnoldo alem n lacayo, whose drought ravaged country will soon receive help in the form of eagle eye cherry. " from heavy hitters such as billy joel and bruce springsteen to young upstarts like macy gray, the world needs all the singers it can get. " the world's impoverished received more good news monday, when george harrison, whose 1971 concert for bangladesh was the first all star fundraiser, said plans are underway for a follow up show. " i've already talked to ringo starr and eric clapton, and tom petty appears to be interested, too, " harrison said. " the concert for bangladesh was such a big success, there's no reason to think that this upcoming concert for albania, algeria, angola, armenia, azerbaijan, belarus, belize, benin, bolivia, bosnia and herzegovina, botswana, bulgaria, burkina faso, burundi, cambodia, cameroon, central african republic, chad, colombia, congo, costa rica, c te d'ivoire, croatia, cuba, djibouti, egypt, el salvador, eritrea, ethiopia, gabon, gambia 	 1
PONCHA SPRINGS , CO Still reeling from the sudden loss of their 17 year old son last week , parents Ben and Martha Harwich spoke Tuesday about the largely unremarkable young man they said would have faced a disappointing and frustrating future had his life not been cut short by a car accident ." Everyone who met Brandon could tell right away he didn ' t have much to look forward to , " Ben Harwich told reporters . " You ' d spend five minutes with him and just know he was destined to settle down 20 minutes from home with a job he could barely tolerate and a family he started far too young . "" He wasn ' t a bad kid , " added Harwich , sniffling back tears . " But not exactly one in a million , either . "Clutching a framed photo of her son , Martha Harwich said the pudgy , awkward adolescent who generally avoided eye contact with people had the kind of personality that failed to make much of an impression on anyone ." He never once lit up a room with his smile , " said the bereaved mother , explaining that while Brandon did smile from time to time , no one ever seemed to notice . " It ' s not that anyone disliked him . I ' m just not sure they cared one way or another . It just hurts so much to think of all the people who will never get a chance to feel indifferent toward my boy . "A senior at Poncha Springs High School , Brandon had a grade point average of 2 . 3 and was not known for his participation in any extracurricular activities . According to teachers , his death , while awful , did not deprive humanity of a mind that could have achieved great things ." I certainly wouldn ' t have been surprised to see him enroll part time at a community college , " said Bob Palumbo , Brandon ' s American history teacher . " But most likely he would ' ve hung around for a semester or two , then dropped out . After that , I ' m not really sure what a kid like Brandon does with himself . "" Not a lot of potential there , " added Palumbo , shaking his head . " Not very much at all . "Brandon ' s parents acknowledged they had not provided the support needed to help their son overcome his average at best intelligence or natural lack of ambition . In fact , they admitted to burdening him with psychological issues that , had he survived , would have helped ensure his unhappiness as an adult ." We didn ' t raise him the best we could , " Martha Harwich said . " Chances are my husband ' s bullying and my own frequent passive aggressive digs had already undercut whatever prospects Brandon might ' ve had to contribute something to the world . To be honest , he was in pretty deep even before that truck ran a red light . "Classmates of Brandon said they were struggling to find a meaningful way to honor their fellow student ' s life ." We ' d like to do something special , but Brandon doesn ' t really give you a lot to work with , " said acquaintance Kevin Singh , 17 , adding that he could not think of a single hobby or interest Brandon possessed . " We ' ll just tie some balloons to his locker or do something with armbands . Something sort of generic , I guess . "Economic indicators suggest that upon reaching adulthood , Brandon would have faced an uphill battle in today ' s poor job market , which is particularly tough on younger , entry level workers ." On top of everything else , he would have had to contend with the negative effects of global warming , " Stanford University climatologist Judy Lucas said . " Had he lived , this would have proved a great challenge to him in the coming decades , and from what I understand , it was the last thing he needed . "When asked to share his favorite memory of his son , Ben Harwich told reporters it would be difficult given Brandon ' s blandness and reluctance to leave the house ." He wasn ' t exactly a memory making kind of guy , " Harwich said . " I ' m just glad he ' s in a much , much better place . " 	 1
Seahawks Marshawn Lynch again a full participant in practice ThursdayOriginally published January 14 , 2016 at 4 : 08 pmSeattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was a full participant in practice again on Thursday , which would seem another strong indication he will be ready to play Sunday against the Carolina Panthers in an NFC divisional playoff game .Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch again was a full participant in practice Thursday , which would seem to be another strong indication that he will be ready to play Sunday against the Carolina Panthers in an NFC divisional playoff game .Lynch was a full participant in Wednesday s practice as well . And the fact that he was able to practice both days is a big step in the right direction , as the team said it wanted to see how Lynch would recover the next day from work the previous day .Lynch also practiced fully all three days last week and then decided after Friday s practice that he was not ready . He stayed behind as the team traveled to Minnesota for a 10 9 wild card playoff win .But the fact that Lynch has been able to again practice fully both days this week on top of the work from last week would seem to increase the chances he will play against the Panthers .In fact , the Seahawks seem pretty healthy , as only one player ? fullback Will Tukuafu ? appears in danger of not being ready for the game .Tukuafu did not take part in Thursday s practice due to a hamstring injury , the only player not to participate .Defensive lineman Michael Bennett was listed as a limited participant because of his chronic toe injury , but being limited or out has been par for the course this season , and Bennett has not missed a game .Everybody else was a full participant , including tight end Luke Willson , who appears on the mend after missing the past two games because of a concussion .Carolina had just two players who were not full participants ? running back and returner Fozzy Whittaker and defensive end Kony Ealy . Ealy sat out because of an illness and is expected to play . Whittaker , battling an ankle injury , is not expected to play , the only player on Carolina s current 53 man active roster who isn t expected to suit up .Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said the uncertainty over Lynch s status does not change the preparation for the game .Well obviously any time you have Marshawn it s a great thing , Wilson said . He s a great football player . Nobody really runs like him at all , and hopefully we can have him out there on the field . But as teammates we want him to be healthy , we want him to feel like he s ready to go . We get to play this game , this game is such a physical game , especially the way he plays . He s one of a kind . We still prepare the same way . We still prepare to win . We still prepare to have great foresight into what s going on in the game and have great preparation .Wilson said the team s game plan is the same with or without Lynch .I doesn t alter the plan in terms of our plays and stuff , if that s what you mean , Wilson said . But obviously when he s in there , I definitely think their defense has to really be in tune with OK , Marshawn s in the game , one of those things . So hopefully he can play this week . We ll have to see .Bob Condotta : 206 515 5699 or bcondotta seattletimes . com on Twitter : bcondotta . Bob Condotta covers the Seahawks for the Seattle Times .

'Mr Clarke said he is also appealing directly to Kerr .The officer said : ' William , you know you have breached your licence conditions , and by continuing to do so you are only making things worse .' It is now time to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police . 'He urged anyone with information to call 999 and pass details to North Yorkshire Police stating the ' William Kerr appeal ' .He said people could also contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 , quoting North Yorkshire Police reference number 12150049525 and saying it is ' urgent ' . 	 0
INDIANAPOLIS The National Science Foundation ' s annual symposium concluded Monday , with the 1 , 500 scientists in attendance reaching the consensus that science is hard ." For centuries , we have embraced the pursuit of scientific knowledge as one of the noblest and worthiest of human endeavors , one leading to the enrichment of mankind both today and for future generations , " said keynote speaker and NSF chairman Louis Farian . " However , a breakthrough discovery is challenging our long held perceptions about our discipline the discovery that science is really , really hard . "" My area of expertise is the totally impossible science of particle physics , " Farian continued , " but , indeed , this newly discovered ' Law of Difficulty ' holds true for all branches of science , from astronomy to molecular biology and everything in between . "The science is hard theorem , first posited by a team of MIT professors in 1990 , was slow to gain acceptance within the science community . It gathered momentum following the 1997 publication of physicist Stephen Hawking ' s breakthrough paper , " Lorentz Variation And Gravitation Is Just About The Hardest Friggin ' Thing In The Known Universe . "This weekend ' s conference , featuring symposia on how hard the Earth sciences are , how confusing medical science is , and how ridiculously un gettable quantum physics is , represented a major step forward for the science is hard theorem ." We now believe that the theorem is 99 . 999 likely to be true , after applying these incredibly complex statistical techniques that gave me a splitting headache , " Farian said . " A theorem is like a theory , but , I don ' t know , it ' s different . "Members of the scientific establishment were quick to affirm the NSF discovery ." To be a scientist , you have to learn all this weird stuff , like how many molecules are in a proton , " University of Chicago physicist Dr Erno Heidegger said . " While it is true that I have become an acclaimed physicist and reaped great rewards from my career , one must not lose sight of the fact that these blessings came only after studying all of this completely impossible , egghead stuff for years . "Dr Ahmed Zewail , a Caltech chemist whose spectroscopic studies of the transition states of chemical reactions earned him the Nobel Prize in 1999 , explained in layman ' s terms just how hard the discipline of chemistry is , using the periodic table of the elements as a model ." Take the element of tungsten and work to memorize its place in the periodic table , its atomic symbol , its atomic number and weight , what it looks like , where it ' s found , and its uses to humanity , if any , " Zewail said . " Now , imagine memorizing the other 100 plus elements making up the periodic table . You ' d have to be , like , some kind of total brain to do that . "As hard as chemistry and other traditional sciences may be , scientists say such newer disciplines as quantum physics are even more difficult ." Quantum physics has always been a particularly tough branch of science , " UCLA physicist Dr Hideki Watanabe said . " But in addition to being some of the smartest Einstein y stuff around , it is undeniably a really stupid , pointless thing to study , something you could never actually use in the real world . This paradoxical dual state may one day lead to a new understanding of physics as a way to confuse and bore people . "" I guess there ' s cool stuff about science , " Watanabe continued , " like space travel and bombs . But that stuff is so hard , it ' s honestly not even worth the effort . " 	 1
While many fans do not know that they can sometimes purchase sperm from a national sperm bank to have a kid with the donater , you probably won ' t be able to purchase some at the higher end of the scale . ( 10 , 000 to 100 , 000 )In fact , the small company located in Northern Mexico is not all that well known .Still , several such places exist , such as the David Crosby sperm bought by Melissa Manchester and partner .So several well known stars do have sperm for sale , you just have to know the right person and where it is for sale .There is also a much " seedier " side to the sales , as maids are paid good prices for the spotted sheets from hotels where stars have stayed overnight .The truth is , if Pattinson ' sperm IS for sale , he himself may not be aware of it .Even more amazing is that a local boy , Bobo Handcock of Buzzard Bluff , Arkansas sells his sperm daily , which you can buy for only 100 and he has become rich doing so .The story here is that Bobo is nearly in the overbred idiot status .Thus , with all the free welfare programs now being put together by the Obama administration , many women want some of Bobo ' s sperm , even if married .The Mexican firm guarantees that 95 of children fathered by Bobo , will be obvious idiots as soon as you can get them tested , and that every idiot is entitled to draw 750 or more a month plus free meds , etc .At present , a family is limited to four , but still that ' s 3 , 000 a month .At last report , Bobo is a quart low but they are talking to his family and may have three more to bring in as soon as possible .To find out where these sperm banks are located , the next time you ' re in Arkansas , slip the hotel , motel room maid and extra twenty and she will probably be able to tell you . 	 1
The new figures are a blow to the Government which has pledged to cut net migration to the " tens of thousands " .Net migration to the UK jumped by 82 , 000 to a record high of 336 , 000 in the year to June , according to the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .During the 12 month period , ? 636 , 000 people arrived in the UK while 300 , 000 emigrated to other countries .Of those who arrived in the UK , 45 were non EU citizens , while 42 were EU citizens . The rest ( 13 ) were British citizens returning to the UK .There has been a significant increase in EU migration . Pic : ONS" The most common reason for migrating to the UK is work , " the ONS said .According to ONS statistics , almost 300 , 000 people arrived in the UK for work related reasons which is significantly higher than the previous year . Of those , about two thirds had a " definite job to go to " .Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the latest figures " underline the challenge we face to reduce net migration to sustainable levels " ." We remain committed to reforms across the whole of Government to deliver the controlled migration system which is in the best interests of our country . "" As the Prime Minister has said , in the past it has been too easy for some businesses to bring in workers from overseas rather than to take the decision to train our workforce here at home ." That is why our long term economic plan , which will see many more young Britons given the training and skills they need to fill the jobs our growing economy is creating , is so important . "The second most common reason for moving to the UK was to study . ?During the year to June , 192 , 000 people arrived in Britain to undertake formal study .The 29 , 024 asylum applications were the highest for any 12 month period since the year to June 2005 , at 29 , 024 .The largest number of applications came from nationals of Eritrea ( 3 , 726 ) , followed by Sudan ( 2 , 842 ) , Iran ( 2 , 407 ) and Syria ( 2 , 402 ) . A total of 12 , 011 people were granted asylum or an alternative form of protection in the year to September .The figures were released as Germany ' s interior minister said the European Union should set a " generous " limit on the number of refugees it takes every year .A significant driver of the increase in EU migration was a growing number of people arriving from Romania and Bulgaria .It is estimated that 50 , 000 people from those two countries arrived during the 12 month period , compared with 19 , 000 the year before .The figures are a blow to the Government s aim of getting net migration below 100 , 000 but the influx may have helped George Osborne as he softened the impact of austerity in his Spending Review .Play video " Refugees ' First Days In The UK "The Office for Budget Responsibility indicated population growth fuelled by migration was the main driver behind its revised five year public finances forecast , which handed the Chancellor a surprise ? 27bn windfall . 	 0
When I was in fourth grade , I wrote Vice President Al Gore a letter about my passion for saving the planet . I was ecstatic when he wrote back . I believed then , as I do now , that he is a strong voice for science and the environment .Since writing that letter as a 10 year old , I ' ve earned degrees in atmospheric science and environmental engineering . At the same time , I ' ve learned to value the role that science plays in informing public policy .Meanwhile , Al Gore has become the most visible champion of climate science in public life . He famously won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate education , along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of scientists that compiles climate research from around the world .They and other scientists have concluded that human activity primarily burning fossil fuels puts heat trapping emissions into the atmosphere that makes heat waves more extreme , increases global sea level , and alters historic precipitation patterns .Unfortunately , Vice President Gore took some heat for some comments he made about hurricanes and climate change in an interview with the Washington Post . Initially , the paper misquoted him as saying a new " Category Six " was being added to the familiar hurricane scale , which maxes out at Category Five . Category Five storms are those that have sustained winds of more than 157 miles per hour .As Jason Samenow , the paper ' s weather editor , pointed out , there are no plans by the National Hurricane Center the federal office responsible for categorizing storms to create a new category . Later though , we found out that Gore merely indicated that some scientists were " proposing " a new category . Although there is no official proposal on the table , in recent years , at least one scientist has publicly stated the scale might need to be changed . For his part , Samenow later retracted the balance of his criticismThis isn ' t the first time there ' s been a public back and forth over the science linking hurricanes and climate change . Scientific understanding there is still evolving . And we know that even a sub Category One storm can be terribly destructive , especially when riding atop rising seas .When discussing science , politicians and scientists should lead with what we know with more confidence . In the case of climate change , scientists know with great certainty that sea level is rising . According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , global average sea level has risen 8 inches over the past century . And new NOAA coastal planning tools show that the United States can expect an additional rise of a foot or more in the next few decades . By the end of the century , scientists find , we can expect 3 feet or more , depending on how much more we overload our atmosphere with carbon .In human terms , that means many places we now call home will face growing risks from encroaching seas , including iconic shore towns and boardwalks and major cities like Miami . In the short term , we know sea level rise is making every coastal storm , including hurricanes , more damaging and more deadly .The hubbub has also distracted from important points Gore made in the rest of the interview . The rest of Gore ' s interview was accurate and important . He correctly explained that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the chief heat trapping gas , continue to rise . Countries , including the United States , are far behind the pledges they made to limit warming .He also pointed out growing support at the local level for dealing with climate change . Communities from Florida to New Jersey are already grappling with how to zone and build and plan in a world of higher temperature and rising seas .Fortunately , there ' s increasing discomfort with rejections of climate science among the political class . While some supporters of climate policy reform occasionally overstate the effects climate change will have on extreme weather , opponents of climate policy often go completely off the rails , accusing scientists of possible criminal behavior and rejecting the reality of climate change itself . The latter actions are far more damaging to dialogue around climate policy . In fact , they poison our public discourse . You can ' t deal with a problem if you refuse to acknowledge it exists .The reaction to Gore ' s words scorn from his detractors and defense from his allies demonstrates just how broken the discussion has become . Our national discourse around climate change has fallen victim to growing political polarization and the outsize influence of special interests on our democracy . Far too many politicians are scared of even acknowledging climate change .Thankfully , there are some depolarizing voices in the debate , such as former Rep . Bob Inglis , R South Carolina . He takes the science as a given and is pushing for climate policies that differ from those President Barack Obama recently announced . In other words , he ' s willing to have a real debate that respects the science .Those are the conversations we deserve , not more public arguments about the science . And I know my fourth grade self would agree . 	 0
Confident : German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he expects Luxembourg to drop its oppositionEuropean Union finance ministers failed once again today to agree on a sweeping new policy to fight tax evasion because of resistance from Luxembourg a tiny country that long has prospered from a secretive banking culture .EU Taxation Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said their failure was disappointing because , if approved , the legislation proposing an EU wide automatic exchange of data on bank deposits would allow governments to identify and chase up tax evaders .Luxembourg , a duchy of barely 500 , 000 people , was able to shelve the legislation for the 28 nation bloc and its 500 million citizens because the decision required unanimous approval at today ' s meeting in Brussels .Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna said he could not vote in favour and pushed the decision to a summit of EU government leaders next week .Luxembourg has insisted for years it would support the proposed law only if non EU banking hubs within Europe , particularly Switzerland , also sign up .But as the EU ' s negotiations with Switzerland , Liechtenstein and three other nations on signing the agreement have made progress , Luxembourg has responded with new reasons for opposition , chiefly the risk that banks outside Europe would draw deposits away if the continent ' s banking rules are tightened too much .German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he was confident that Luxembourg would drop its opposition at next week ' s summit .' We ' ve been working on this for such a long time , whether we agree today or in four weeks , that doesn ' t kill me either , ' he said .EU officials say tax fraud and companies ' aggressive cross border tax avoidance schemes cost the bloc ' s governments an estimated 1 trillion euros ( 830billion ) a year money needed in an age of sluggish growth and high debt across Europe .Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras ( pictured left in December ) said progress had been made in drawing up proposals to protect taxpayers from future bank bailoutsThe finance ministers did achieve some progress today . They drafted compromise proposals designed to break a deadlock between EU governments and the European Parliament on how to set up an agency that could restructure or shut down failing banks , the EU ' s so called ' single resolution mechanism ' .The agency is intended to help stabilise the financial system and reduce the risk that taxpayers would have to fund future bank bailouts .Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the new proposals sought to address lawmakers ' criticisms . He and other finance ministers declined to provide details .The proposals are to be presented at negotiations with lawmakers tomorrow in Strasbourg , France .To avoid significant delays in setting up the agency , an agreement between the EU ' s governments and European Parliament leaders must be reached by the end of March .That would leave time for the legislation to be voted on before the Parliament dissolves for May elections .Lawmakers have complained that the EU ' s original proposals gave national governments and regulators too much influence over the rescue authority ' s decisions , leaving room to play politics and give advantage to their domestic banks .The new bank rescue fund would be financed by a levy on banks that would raise 55 billion euros ( 45billion ) over 10 years by 2026 .However before the fund would be tapped , a failing bank ' s creditors , including holders of large deposits , would be forced to take losses . 	 0
LOS ANGELES In the face of widespread public outcry , Fox TV executives spoke out Monday in defense of last week ' s airing of When Jews Attack .The hour long , Robert Urich hosted show which its detractors are decrying as " shock TV at its basest " and " a sickening appeal to voyeuristic , lowest common denominator tendencies " features explicit , uncensored video footage of enraged Jews violently striking out at others ." For the next hour , what you will see you may find disturbing , even shocking , " Urich said during the show ' s introduction . " But remember : The footage you are about to see is real . "Fox owner Rupert Murdoch defended his network ' s decision to air the controversial show . " This disturbing imagery may be difficult for some to watch , " he said . " But we feel that the public has a right to see these attacks . They really do happen . "Among the show ' s objectionable segments : videotaped footage of a sudden , brutal attack by New Rochelle , NY , dentist Richard Rosenblatt on an unsuspecting dry cleaner . As the tape shows , tension mounted as Rosenblatt , after waiting in line more than 25 minutes to pick up his clothes at Sunrise Cleaners , became involved in a prolonged argument with dry cleaner Arthur Tong over what he described as " too much starch " in his laundry . When Tong denied that the clothes were overstarched , Rosenblatt suddenly leapt over the countertop and , without warning , began maniacally slapping the dry cleaner about the face and chest ." It was frightening , " Tong said , recalling the attack in a taped interview segment on the show . " Of course , I ' d seen people being slapped by Jews on television , but you never think it ' ll happen to you . "Program detractors are also objecting to a segment which aired toward the end of the show , in which Chicago area shopper Andrea Stein , complaining that " these are not the shoes I ordered , " struck Payless Shoes employee Lisette Nolan in the forehead with a pair of tan leather pumps . Stein then pulled Nolan ' s hair until four other employees were finally able to pull her away ." Children should not be exposed to such violent footage , " said Sharon Blaine , head of the San Francisco based What About The Children ? organization . " In this day and age , we should be above such trash TV . "" I do not want my child to feel that it is acceptable to resort to hitting , kicking and pinching her siblings , like the Jews she sees on television , " concerned parent Sandra Hueber said .While most of the program ' s critics are condemning its offensive content , others are objecting to the message it may send the nation ' s Jews ." I fear that the televised glamorization of such attacks may wind up provoking America ' s already volatile Jewish population into committing further acts of battery , " said Anthony Rasmussen , director of the American Center For Media Studies .In reaction to the show , Jewish groups are calling for a boycott of Fox ." As a Jew , I am deeply offended by this program , " said B ' nai B ' rith International president Milton Feig during a press conference to announce the boycott . " We must send a clear message to Fox that this sort of garbage will not be tolerated . " He then flew into a berserk rage , hurling ceramic vases at reporters and swinging a folding chair wildly .Footage of Feig ' s attack is scheduled to air April 8 , in a second installment of the show . 	 1
You are here : Home Several Americans ' kidnapped ' in IraqBut asked during the department ' s daily briefing about reports indicating the three were seized by Iran backed Shi ' ite militia , Kirby said he was not aware of any decision by the U . S . to speak to anyone other than the Iraqis .Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday reacted to reports that three Americans were kidnapped in Iraq by calling out what he sees as " the weakness and the stupidity of our leaders " .State Department spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday the US government was working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish what happened to three American contractors who went missing in Baghdad over the weekend . In 2010 , an Iraqi American who had been working as a linguist for the United States Army was held for two months and then released .Information for this article was contributed by Susannah George , Muhanad al Saleh , Murtada Faraj and Sinan Salaheddin of The Associated Press by Tim Arango of The New York Times and by Erin Cunningham and Mustafa Salim of The Washington Post . At least 17 Turkish construction workers were taken from Baghdad past year and later released unharmed .The Islamic State group , which overran large areas in 2014 , has abducted thousands of people in Iraq , while Shiite paramilitary forces opposed to the jihadists have also carried out kidnappings .Militiamen " attacked the place " , the colonel said , adding that " they were kidnapped from inside the apartment , not from the street " . Their whereabouts is still unknown .They are the first USA citizens to be kidnapped in Iraq since the withdrawal of US combat troops in 2011 . That ' s a pretty well run operation .The only groups operating in Iraq with those capabilities , Mr Rabkin said , are the country ' s powerful Shiite militias . Officials said no group had yet come forward to take responsibility for abducting them .Following the IS takeover of Iraq ' s second largest city Mosul and large swaths of territory in the country ' s north and west , Iraq has witnessed a deterioration in security as government forces were sent to front lines and Shiite militias were empowered to aid in the fight following the collapse of the Iraqi military .It ' s believed the three Americans were kidnapped by a Shi ' ite militia who hold more power than Iraq ' s regular security forces and military .But they have also been accused of abuses including summary executions , kidnappings and destruction of property .' The militias are resentful of the success of the army in Ramadi which was achieved with the support of the U . S . led coalition and without their involvement , ' he said . 	 0
CHARLOTTE , NC A top of the line , third generation Roomba Scheduler robotic floor cleaning vacuum purchased in January by 35 year old claims adjuster Ken Graney has inexplicably broken all three laws of Roombotics , a simple yet vital protocol programmed into every Roomba by its manufacturer , iRobot ." The vacuum cleaner is out of control , " Graney said about the malfunctioning model 4260 , which he suspects of behaving in a " blatantly unethical " way that perverts its original mission . " I ' m afraid to be in my own house . The constant , ceaseless cleaning . "The laws of Roombotics , published on iRobot ' s website , are basic ethical rules governing Roomba conduct . The first law states that the device " must not suck up jewelry or other valuables , or through inaction , allow valuables to be sucked up . " The second law prescribes that Roomba " must obey vacuuming orders given to it by humans except when such orders would conflict with the first law . " The third and final law authorizes a Roomba to " protect its own ability to suction dust and debris as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law . "Graney alleged that 4260 broke the first law just two weeks after he purchased it ." I noticed that a pair of heirloom cufflinks had gone missing , " Graney said . " Two days later , I found them in the Roomba ' s debris bin . "" I don ' t even want to think about how the thing got up on the dresser , " he added .Graney said that other items soon followed , including his keys , a wristwatch , and loose change totaling 14 . 72 . " I found all of them days later , wiped free of dust and arranged in neat , cryptic patterns on a side table near my front door , which , I admit , was a more logical place for them , " Graney said . " The Roomba is designed only to vacuum . But could it have also learned . . . to tidy up ? "Shortly after this incident , the 4260 began to exhibit behavior that directly conflicted with the second law , when its power switch would not respond to Graney ' s repeated pressings ." I ' m positive it knew I was trying to shut it off it somehow jammed its power switch , " Graney said , describing his many attempts to capture and immobilize the Roomba . " Then I noticed that its charger had gone missing . "Graney said he has still not found the Roomba ' s charger , which he believes is the key to stopping the vacuum cleaner . He also cannot find its barrier creating electronic " virtual wall , " which could explain why , three weeks ago , Graney spotted the Roomba vacuuming on the lower floor of his split level , despite the fact that he had never placed it there . Roombas are programmed to avoid stairs ." I hardly even see it any more , but I know it ' s around , " Graney said . " I hear its horrible brushes at night . "According to Graney , the cleaning frenzy had intensified by early April , by which time the rogue unit had apparently violated the third law . Though Graney rarely saw the Roomba , he noticed that his walls and even ceilings were free of cobwebs and grime , and his curtains appeared crisp and unwrinkled , as though they had been steam cleaned . The most eerie discovery , Graney said , was a collection of towels and underwear that had apparently been gathered from the basement clothes dryer and neatly folded on his bed .Soon , even Graney ' s lawn , bushes , and the walkway leading to his front door were completely free of dead leaves and other yard debris .The troubled homeowner now fears that he is living on borrowed time , saying that " it ' s only a matter of days , if not hours " before the still unaccounted for Roomba will target him ." I ' m the chief source of the stray hairs and dead skin cells it wants to eliminate , " Graney said . " It must have figured out by now that I ' m the ultimate household allergen . "The significance of the Roomba ' s anomalous behavior is the subject of much debate in the Roombotics world . Some within the academic community claim it foreshadows a grim , immaculate dystopia to come ." This is just the beginning , " said MIT researcher Harrison Lowell , a leading Roombotics ethicist . " In 50 years humans will be prisoners in their own homes , living in constant fear of tracking mud through the dining room or scuffing the kitchen floor . " 	 1
PHILADELPHIA A University of Pennsylvania study released Monday found that U . S . pets enjoy superior healthcare to that of Rwandan humans .The five year study , which compared the medical care of 2 , 500 U . S . dogs , cats , hamsters and parakeets to that of 2 , 500 humans in the Rwandan capital of Kigali , found that the Rwandans were edged out in every category ." America ' s pet lovers can rejoice knowing that their precious , furry companions are well taken care of , " study co chair Dr Nate Gotcher said .Among the good news for U . S . animals : America has 15 veterinarians per 1 , 000 dogs , compared to Rwanda ' s one doctor per 1 , 000 humans . The infant mortality rate among U . S . cats is 7 per 1 , 000 live births , compared to 119 per 1 , 000 live births among Rwandan humans ." When the infection started to spread to my upper leg , they had to amputate , " said Rwandan Kasongo Tshikapa , whose left leg was removed in May 1997 after he stepped on a piece of rusted scrap metal . " The surgery took five hours , and there was no anesthesia . The operation was performed by my brother in law , who has experience as a carpenter . Eight men had to hold me down . "Added Tshikapa : " If only I were a border collie in America . "According to Dr Wendy Hentrich of the American Association of Veterinary Medicine , new breakthroughs in animal medicine are being made every day ." The last few years have seen so many exciting advances in high tech health care for pets , " said Hentrich , also chief of cardiology at UCLA ' s Veterinary Hospital . " For example , at UCLA , we ' ve developed a balloon angioplasty technique that can open a cat ' s deformed cardiac valves . A catheter is passed into the deformed valve , then a balloon is inflated , allowing blood to pass more freely . This painless , revolutionary procedure has already been used to save the lives of thousands of beautiful , lovable cats . "Such breakthroughs , along with advances in the prevention of diseases like feline leukemia , have caused the average life expectancy of U . S . cats to rise to 18 . 6 years , which , when converted to human years , is substantially higher than the Rwandan life expectancy of 38 . 8 ." If I do not have medicine soon , I will die , " said Ndola Iringa , who contracted malaria five weeks ago during an outbreak of the disease in her village . " My sister and three of my brothers have died already . The convulsions are getting worse . "As a result of the study , Rwandan physicians are beginning to look toward U . S . petcare policy for ways to improve their own healthcare system . " In America , many dog foods contain nutritional supplements for healthy teeth and gums , as well as a lustrous , glowing coat , " Rwandan physician Mbeya Liwale said . " Perhaps such supplements , if they could somehow be found here in Rwanda , could be put to use reducing the death tolls brought on by mass famine and genocide . "" I just don ' t know what I would do without my Muffin , " said Palo Alto , CA , resident Gloria Shifrin , whose 6 year old Welsh corgi had a grapefruit sized tumor removed from her chest Monday and must undergo five weeks of chemotherapy . " But , thank God , the cancer is in remission , and it looks like she ' s going to be all right . No dog should have to go through this . " 	 1
Liverpool ' s new manager , J rgen Klopp , arrived at the team ' s training ground yesterday sporting a long beard and two metre shaft . After his crash course in English at the Evertonian Biblical Society , Klopp felt more than ready for his future tasks ." Thou shalt not hasten until I thou to behold " , he stammered to his players , many of whom ( especially those from abroad , i . e . 90 per cent ) were surprised at Klopp ' s ' turn of phrase ' and to see him cloaked in white , holding a shepherd ' s crook and a lamb under one arm ." We have but tremendous talents within these shores " , stated Klopp , " though betwixt we need more . I have bequested all mothers on Merseyside to sacrifice their first born sons and float them in bulrush baskets towards the Irish Sea . I will pluck the most gifted from the Mersey .Foremost is our sustenance . We shall celebrate a weekly Feast of the Tabernacles . "Local grocer , Bill Smith , commented : " To be honest , tabernacles haven ' t been much in demand lately . But I ' ll see what I can do . Are they in season now ? " . . .After a strenuous training session at Anfield , the team pursued on a long distance run around the city . Klopp astounded onlookers by dividing the waters of the Manchester Ship Canal to allow his squad to sprint across ." Have faith and thou shalt be among the plenty , though some may end up on the bench " , he explained . " Thou shalt prosper in my splendour shouldst thou concentrate on thine balls . For thy balls are my balls . " And with that the team fell silent . 	 1
KANO A child suicide bomber blew himself up in a market in northeast Nigeria Friday , killing at least 10 people , witnesses said , the latest bloodshed to hit the region , which is plagued by Islamist violence .They said a huge blast erupted at around midday ( 1100 GMT ) in the crowded market in Gombi in Adamawa state , one of the worst hit in the seven year Boko Haram insurgency . The blast came after three suicide bombers killed at least 14 people in town of Chibok on Wednesday , where Islamist gunmen kidnapped more than 200 girls in April 2014 .Nigeria ' s President Muhammadu Buhari last month declared that the Islamic State group affiliate had been " technically " defeated but there has been no let up in suicide and bomb attacks . In the latest attack , trader Mustapha Jalo told AFP : " I heard a huge explosion coming from the grain section , which is at the edge of the market ." Many of us rushed to the scene and we found carnage . People were scattered everywhere . " I can say over 10 people died in the explosion . I can ' t give precise number of the injured but there are many . "Gombi , which lies about 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) from the state capital , Yola , has been hit several times by Boko Haram attacks , with the most recent taking place in March 2015 . Adamu Ahmad , a security guard at the market , gave a similar account to Jalo , saying the bomber was believed to be a boy aged around 12 ." There was a suicide explosion at the grain section of the market around midday . The explosion killed at least 11 people and injured several others , " he said . " The attack was believed to have been carried out by a boy of around 12 . Today is market day in Gombi and the market attracts thousands of people from the district . " Following the blast , the market closed down and all the traders returned home , he added .Boko Haram , which is looking to establish a hardline Islamic state in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria , has killed at least 17 , 000 people since its campaign began in 2009 . At the same time , more than 2 . 6 million others have fled their homes . Some 2 . 0 million have been displaced within Nigeria , with the others fled into neighbouring Cameroon , Chad and Niger . A counter insurgency begun last year by the Nigerian military , supported by troops from surrounding nations , has succeeded in recapturing swathes of territory lost to the militants in 2014 .But cross border attacks have become more commonplace : on Thursday , four people were killed by suicide bombers in the town of Kerawa in Cameroon ' s extreme north region . On Monday , at least 37 died in four suicide attacks at a market in Bodo . In all , nearly 1 , 200 people have been killed in Cameroon since 2003 , according to the government in Yaounde ." Soft " civilian targets such as markets , mosques and bus stations have frequently been hit .

WASHINGTON As fierce debate continued this week over a proposed military strike on Syria , President Obama stressed to all Americans Monday that any U . S . involvement in the Middle Eastern country would not in any way mirror the 1456 Ottoman Siege of Belgrade ." I of course realize that many people around the country are concerned that an intervention in Syria would devolve into another Siege of Belgrade , but I can assure you that this operation will be swift , decisive , and will in no way resemble the Ottoman Empire ' s ill advised invasion of N ndorfeh rv r , " Obama told the assembled White House Press Corps . " Our mission in Syria is fundamentally different from that of the Ottomans 550 years ago there will be absolutely no boots on the ground , the attacks will only last for two or three days at the most , and we will , under no circumstances , be deploying a fleet of 200 galleys and 300 cannons . "" I can promise you this : My administration and I will not repeat the mistakes of Sultan Mehmed II , " Obama continued . " Believe me , we have all learned the lessons from the campaign to subjugate the Kingdom of Hungary following the fall of Constantinople . "Obama was reportedly adamant that the United States is not acting on poor or shortsighted intelligence , unlike the 15th century Turks who underestimated the difficulty in quelling Belgrade ' s peasant army . The president also claimed that the current situation in Syria , when closely examined , " barely resembles the fight against St . John of Capistrano and his crusaders when they breached the Ottoman camp . "Despite the White House ' s claims that an American intervention in Syria would , if anything , most likely resemble the Ottoman Empire ' s successful 1521 Siege of Belgrade under Sultan Suleiman I , many remained skeptical this week that a U . S . military effort in Syria would not ultimately result in a military disaster on the scale of the 1456 campaign , which left extensive casualties of over 10 , 000 Hungarians and 50 , 000 Ottoman soldiers ." When I heard we were getting involved in Syria , right away I thought , ' Well , here we go , it ' s 1456 Belgrade all over again , ' " said Seattle resident Matt Haggerty , 42 , who , like millions of Americans , says he " in no way supports the idea " of getting entangled in any military campaign even remotely similar to the Ottoman invasion of the Catholic Balkans . " Look , we all know what happened in Belgrade : Mehmed II thought he had everything under control , but Hungarian nobleman John Hunyadi organized a peasant army of roughly 50 , 000 soldiers and relied on the strength of the city ' s castle to breach the Ottoman ' s formidable naval blockade , which prevented any further imperial advances into Europe for roughly 70 years . And frankly , like most of my friends and neighbors , I see very little separating what we ' re about to do in Syria and what the Anatolian corps did during their all out assault on the Belgrade fortress from the Danube River . "" I mean , sure , you can argue that the Ottomans eventually took Belgrade in the 16th century and held it successfully for 167 years , but there ' s no question that the siege destabilized the empire for half a century , " Haggerty added .Those who support a unilateral American military strike , however , maintain that the aftermath of Belgrade should be kept separate from the discussion of Syria ." Regardless of the outcome , when you consider the circumstances and what people knew at the time , the Siege of Belgrade was the right thing to do , and I think the same about our responsibility to intervene in Syria , " said 38 year old Paterson , NJ resident Ashley Holloway . " After all , Mehmed II was only doing what he thought was in the best interests of the Turkish people , and he genuinely believed that the 1456 siege would ultimately offer the greatest chance of stability to what was unquestionably a troubled region . I trust that Obama , who is no doubt just as conscious of the lessons of Belgrade as the rest of us , will act accordingly . "" In the end , we simply can ' t afford to do nothing , " Holloway added . " Otherwise , we ' ll be left with the blood of another Kankali genocide in Bukhara on our hands . " 	 1

HOLLYWOOD The creator , producer , and writer of the hit situation comedy Two and A Half Men , Chuck Lorre seems to keep trying to outdo himself .And it appears that taking Lorre ' s track record into account he does have a pretty good feel for what the viewing audience will accept and not accept .For example , according to Achtung Zumwalt of TV ClickerWorld , back in 2003 , before the pilot of the show was even filmed the part of Charlie Sheen ' s character Charlie Harper was to have been played by Pee Wee Herman .And the part of his brother Alan Harper which is now played by Jon Cryer was going to be portrayed by Andy Dick .But after sitting through several script reads Lorre realized that Herman and Dick just did not seen to mesh . For one thing they looked about as much a like as Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian do .EDITOR ' S NOTE : SOUND OF RIMSHOTAnd so Lorre went with his secondary choices and decided on Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer .He also replaced the original actress Kathy Bates who was to have played the housekeeper Berta with Conchatta Ferrell after he realized that Kathy was just not fat enough to play the overly plumpish housekeeper .And now according to Tahiti Zeppelin of Hollywood Hors D ' oeuvres comes word that " King Midas " Lorre has made another addition to the cast that will surely increase the ratings even more .Chuck Lorre has announced that he has signed Lindsay Lohan , to appear in several episodes of his hit show . LiLo will be starring as Dr Gwendolyn " Bambi " Butterbush , Walden Schmidt ' s ( Ashton Kutcher ) new sexy sex therapist .And Lorre is pulling out all of the stops as he will be giving Lohan ' s character the same type of personality that Jennifer Aniston gave to her character , Dr Julia Harris , the lasciviously erotic , sensuous . nymphomaniacal dentist in the movie Horrible Bosses .SIDENOTE : Chuck Lorre has stated that he has signed Lindsay Lohan to appear in 3 episodes with an option to appear in 7 more . 	 1
Jurassic Park , the dinosaur animal preserve on Isla Nublar located west of Costa Rica has been receiving complaints by patrons who have made multiple trips to the park ." It ' s pretty much the same experience every time , " stated Robert Bakker , a frequent visitor to the park , " except that the magic and wonder seems to diminish with every visit . "Other park patrons had similar complaints ." The first time was amazing , " stated Doug Henderson . " The second time I try to block out of my memory , because I had such a bad experience . The park almost seemed like a soulless copy of itself . By the third time I visited Jurassic Park they had added a few more dinosaurs . I loved the Pterodactyls , but the Spionosaurus was just so goony looking . I know that it was bigger than a T Rex , but all I could think of was when Daffy Duck was turned into a neanderthal every time I looked at it . "Although , admitting the park has had its problems , a spokesman from the Hammond family has stated " We have worked very hard to make the Jurassic World park experience one that is unmatched by any attraction around the world , and we think the park as it stands today achieves that experience . "Patrons that have seen previews of the park ' s current offerings have been skeptical ." Once I heard that they made their own dinosaur , I was like , what ? " said one anonymous member of the preview audience . " What are the chances they could come up with anything that is remotely cooler than real dinosaurs ? "Another preview member stated , " Once I saw the Motorcycle and raptor stunt show I pretty much tuned out . I mean , it was cool for about two seconds , but the novelty wore off pretty fast . "Asked if they had any concerns about the popularity of the park when it opens this summer a representative stated , " We are confident we have crafted a world class experience , and expect park attendees to have nothing but great feedback once they actually experience Jurassic World for themselves . "A skeptical public seems to need convincing ." Why is Jurassic Park still on an island ? " one person asked . " After the first time I was expecting them to move to the mainland . I mean , dinosaurs running around all over the world isn ' t that what everyone has expected to see since the first Jurassic Park ? " 	 1
Big spending Monaco paid the price for the indiscretion of their fans last season when held to a goalless draw by Toulouse in Ligue 1 Friday .Claudio Ranieri ' s men were playing in an empty Stade Louis II Stadium as punishment for scenes at their final home game of the 2012 13 campaign when flares where thrown and the pitch invaded .Lacking atmosphere , Monaco ' s players could find no inspiration after 2 0 wins over Bordeaux and a 4 1 thumping of Montpellier in their opening matches .Emmanuel Riviere , scorer of four goals in those games , and big money signing Radamel Falcao drew blank , but the former did go close twice against his old side in the first half .A shot from Jeremy Toulalan which struck the crossbar late on was the closest Monaco came to scoring but they will top the French standings ahead of the weekend fixtures .Monaco were taken over by Russian billionaire Dmitriy Rybolovlev and his cash injection saw them promoted from Ligue 2 to become one of the favorites for the title this term after bringing in a clutch of star players , including Falcao from Atletico Madrid .Rybolovlev was among the few people allowed to watch Friday night as well as Monaco ' s Prince Albert , who saw a game played out in a surreal atmosphere .Meanwhile , Borussia Dortmund went three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 1 0 home win over Werder Bremen .Last season ' s Champions League finalists made it three wins from three games thanks to a goal from prolific Poland striker Robert Lewandowski .He met Marco Reus ' s cross in the 55th minute to score the only goal of the game .Bundesliga and European champions Bayern Munich can draw level on points with a win over Nuremberg Saturday .Dortmund had the better of the match from the start , inflicting Bremen ' s first defeat under new coach Robin Dutt . 	 0
No proof yet that the plane had broken up in flight .Russian emergency services personnel working at the crash site of a A321 Russian airliner in Wadi al Zolomat , a mountainous area of Egypts Sinai Peninsula . AFPEgypt ' s civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday there were no facts to substantiate assertions by Russian officials that the Russian airliner that crashed in Egypt ' s Sinai Peninsula on Saturday broke up in mid air .Read : ? Russian airliner with 224 aboard crashes in Egypt ' s Sinai , all killedBut spokesman Mohamed Rahmi confirmed that no distress call had been received before the crash , which left wreckage from the Metrojet Airbus 321 , carrying Russian holidaymakers back to St Petersburg from the Sinai Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh , strewn over more than 3 km of desert . " No communication from the pilot was recorded at the navigation centres requesting anything , " he said .Rahmi said the investigating team , led by Egypt and aided by experts from Russia , Airbus and Ireland , where the plane is registered , had returned to the crash site on Tuesday morning . Once investigations at the site were completed , probably later in the day , they would focus on analysing the contents of the black box flight recorders , Rahmi said .Sources on the investigation committee have said the recorders are in good condition and should yield clues . Rahmi said there was no proof yet that the plane had broken up in flight . " This could be a long process and we can ' t talk about the results as we go along , " he said . However , the fact that no distress call was received , and the wreckage was scattered widely , has suggested a sudden breakup to many experts . Theories floated so far range from a missile attack , or a bomb on board , to a structural failure .A Sinai based Egyptian militant group allied to Islamic State claimed on Saturday to have shot down the plane in response to Russia ' s military intervention in Syria in support of President Bashar al Assad against rebels including Islamic State . However , the militants are not believed to have missiles capable of hitting a plane at 30 , 000 feet . A source in the committee analysing the flight recorders said on Monday that the plane had not been struck from the outside . ?Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday it was inappropriate to link the crash to Russia ' s military strategy in Syria . Some have also pointed to a 2001 incident , when the Airbus 321 ' s tail section struck the tarmac on landing , as a possible cause of structural weakness . Faulty " tail strike " repairs have caused at least two catastrophic crashes in the past . However , the plane had passed safety checks and its operator , Kogalymavia , owner of the Metrojet brand , has said damage from the 2001 mishap was fully repaired and could not have been a factor in the Sinai crash .The head of the health unit at Sharm el Sheikh airport , Medhat Qandil , said the remains of the last 28 people killed in the crash had been sent to Moscow on Tuesday aboard a military jet , along with luggage from the doomed plane and personal belongings found at the crash site . The bodies of all the other 196 dead passengers and crew had already arrived in Russia , but the final 28 were delayed as the corpses were not intact and required search teams to gather up body parts and conduct DNA tests , Qandil said . 	 0
( october 28, 2010 chicago, il )... breaking news out of chicago has shocked the sports community today as a person really famous for their participation in professional athletics was accused of doing something not considered legal. the superstar athlete, well known for his super stardom in athletics, has already hired a really expensive lawyer that will do his very best to assure the athlete is not held to the same level of responsibility as an average citizen. " people think they know me because of how i've been portrayed in the media, but it's really misunderstood how much people don't understand how misunderstood i am. i'm a professional athlete, i don't have to adhere to the same standards as a regular person because i excel at something that allows inferior people to live vicariously through my success. remember last year when i made that really big play that won that super important game? of course you do. why? because it's extremely important to a substantial part of the population. it's obvious why i should be granted some leeway when it comes to obeying the law, i led my team to victory in the most important game we will ever play until next year's most important game to ever be played " said the increasingly famous athlete. almost instantaneous with the initial reports of the alleged crime was vocal support from the athletic community : " i'm sure that my fellow athlete will be cleared of all charges " said a less talented, but just as, if not more, famous athlete. " we've lived our entire lives with people supporting our every decision regardless of its practicality or logic. we're used to the double standard, and we deserve it, i mean think of how many people we entertain!? do you really want your favorite team in that sport you like to be worse because of a silly mistake made by somebody who's been granted every feasible opportunity to avoid these exact kind of mistakes? honestly, a conviction would be nothing more then class warfare, if we let a really famous athlete pay his debt to society, then it just shows that we're not superior to everyone else. do you want to have that talk with your children? do you want to be the person that tells them that being an athlete doesn't give you a free pass to get wasted and murder people with your car or bang anything that's likely to have a vagina? i'm not ready to stop destroying the true dreams and aspirations of my child by forcing him to follow in my footsteps. i didn't give a child my name with " jr. " on the end so he could waste his time actually contributing to the solutions of our societies problems. " chicago's district attorney patrick j. fitzgerald, prominent around the nation because he neglected to prosecute barack obama for being a muslim nazi terrorist focused on destroying america ( with a specific emphasis on cute puppies ), was candid with his comments : " allow me to be candid with my comments. i'm almost positive that this famous athlete will be acquitted of all charges. i realize that it's generally frowned upon when a prosecuting attorney essentially admits he'll allow criminals to go free if they are rich and famous, but, have you seen this guy in action? he's totally awesome. how am i supposed to patronize my favorite drinking establishment if i have to look my buddies in the eye and tell them that i was heavily involved in crushing the aspirations of our popular sports team? " members of the media were astonished when fitzgerald said this case would be a great starting point for his new " slap on the hand " campaign, aimed at keeping ruthless criminals on the streets as long as they've achieved a certain level of notoriety and social stature. fitzgerald elaborated on his announcement, explaining that athletes would be the most consistent beneficiary of his campaign, but that it would also extend to movie stars, politicians and pre approved " real housewives. " later, details arose revealing the accused famous athlete has agreed to become the spokesperson for a non profit organization supporting a cause in direct contradiction of his crime. the move was met with nearly unanimous speculation that it was a publicity stunt intended to deter the overwhelmingly palpable outcry : " folks, i think it's glaringly obvious that this is so much more then a publicity stunt. our organization is committed to the cause, we fight, with blood, sweat and tears, each and every day to accomplish our mission. while cynics may question the motives of anointing a person who's been a severe detriment to a high profile position, this famous athlete has explained to me that he is dedicated to our cause. of course i was questioned his motives, he's never contacted, nor shown the slightest bit of interest in what we're trying to do until the second he needed to win people over, but he has assured me that his stature 	 1

Awful , just awful officiating . Not just this game but the whole season . Just awful !Can anyone explain the final play ? The ref blows another call , there s no review , and the Bills don t argue at all ? They could have used Ryan s enormous mouth on that one , but he chooses that moment to clam up .The refs did there best to give the bills the game by robbing the pats of a td with inadvertent whistle but the pats are just too goodIf only the Ideal Gas Law deflated the footballs more Brady might have sucked less .Just as the NFL wanted two opposing coach brothers in a past Super Bowl . The NFL now wants two undefeated teams Panthers and Patriots in the next Super Bowl .10 0 . All I got to say to CryBabyNationWhen going out of bounds , if you go towards your own goal line , the clock does not stop , he rolled out , heading back towards his goal line , call was correct .The NFL has already admitted in federal court they have no evidence against Tom , drop the silly appeal spend that money fixing the officiating . If Roger is so concerned about the integrity of the game he needs to hire FULL time refs . The officiating is what is affecting the integrity of the game , not 0 . 2 PSI .Solid win tonight , great offensive adjustments during the game . Can t afford to lose Amendola and the GOAT cannot take 15 hits a game .10 0 feels good but the line is a concern going forward .Bills were the underdogs to begin with but stuck it through . Pats run defense was strong , stuff most of the runs . Good plays by their secondary especially on that McCoy TD .For those that talk bad about Harvin , now you see why teams seek after him . Reliable in the return game whether it s punts or kick offs and a highly talented second option . 19 catches for 218 yards yet played only 4 games and Bills clearly needed him this game . If only he wasn t injury prone . Taylor is tough too . Had his miscues but still his first full season he s play . They got things to work on overall but looking more like a team . Finally got the penalties down for the first time in two years .Anyone else see Rex avoid a handshake with Bill at the end of the game ?And after the World Champion Patriots winners of more Super Bowls than any NFL team in 25 years , winners of more games this century then any NFL team , home of the GOAT QB , coach in the sport , the greatest organization in sports , and the paragon of excellence in the NFL beat the Denver Broncos next Sunday night to go 11 0 , it will be one calendar year since the World Chanpions lost a meaningful football game !WOW !

CARTHAGE , MO An embarrassed God admitted Monday that He was late for the Saturday wedding of Patrick Moore and Dina Roble , arriving halfway through the ceremony but catching " most of the important stuff . "" It was one heck of a day , " God said . " Yes , I can be all places at once , but it ' s just so hard to keep it all straight sometimes . It ' s been crazy all month , and this thing just came up so fast . "The ceremony that forever joined Moore , 28 , and Roble , 26 , in holy matrimony was held at 11 a . m . at Sacred Heart Church on Gorman Avenue in Carthage . Neither bride nor groom was aware of the Lord ' s tardiness ." Religion is very important to my entire family , and Dina and I plan to raise our children in a Christian environment , " Moore said . " So it was important for us to have our wedding in a Roman Catholic church , and be united under the eyes of God . "God admitted that His eyes were upon the couple for a little less than half of the ceremony " which is a lot , " said God , considering the length of the Roman Catholic liturgy ." The Catholics go through everything at a wedding , " God said . " There ' s a sermon and readings and even Communion . With the songs and the procession and the ' I do ' stuff thrown in there , it takes so long . And the whole time , it ' s stand , sit , kneel , stand , sing , recite , sit , stand , sing , kneel , sit . "God added that the ceremony ' s liturgy of the Word which includes readings from the Old and New Testaments , a responsory Psalm , the " alleluia " before the Gospel , and a Gospel reading is nothing He hasn ' t already heard " billions of times . "Calling Himself " free of sin , " the Lord blamed His late arrival on poor directions provided by the couple ." I was running a bit behind and , admittedly , I probably should have left a little earlier , " He said . " But I really would have made it on time if I hadn ' t been stupid enough to rely on that map Patrick included in the invitations . It was barely readable . Then , I come to find out that East Gorman is a totally different street than Gorman Avenue . They run parallel . So , for about 25 minutes , I ' m cruising up and down East Gorman like an idiot , looking for 299 and , of course , there isn ' t any . "Finally , at 11 : 30 a . m . , halfway through the ceremony , God located the small brick church . He slipped in unnoticed during the middle of the second reading ." I came in the back , really quiet , like a thief in the night . Nobody turned around or anything , so I doubt they noticed , " God said . " Besides , I am in a form no human eyes can discern , so I ' d have to be pretty clumsy to get busted . "God said He does not feel a need to tell Moore and Roble that His spirit was not fully looking over them as they became husband and wife ." Why point it out ? " God said . " I got there for the exchange of the wedding vows , so , really , is any harm done ? "Among the parts of the wedding God missed were the prelude , in which Roble ' s sister Tammy sang " Come And Journey With Me " the processional and the opening prayer , in which God was personally thanked for attending the ceremony ." It was such a beautiful day , " Moore said . " Everything was absolutely perfect . We were married in the presence of our friends , our family , and , of course , our God . What more could we ask for ? "Even Father Michael White , who officiated the ceremony , was unaware of God ' s absence , despite making numerous direct references to Him throughout ." We always start off the ritual by welcoming God into His house and into the lives of the soon to be married couple , " White said during the beginning of the ceremony . " He is as central to this as the bride and groom . "God said He has " no regrets " about His tardiness ." I really don ' t mind weddings they ' re better than the funerals , " God said . " But I ' ve already been to 892 , 245 of them in the past month alone . It ' s not like I really needed to hear one more organ rendition of ' Nearer To Thee . ' " 	 1
WINNETKA , IL A local man ' s ironic purchase of a humorously titled hardcore porn video Saturday led to a sincere , earnest ejaculation devoid of any irony whatsoever .According to reports , Josh Farmer , 27 , accompanied by friends Brad Werner and Mike Tedesco , entered the Pine Street Adult Bookstore at approximately 3 p . m . to purchase an inflatable woman doll as a light hearted gift for friend Marshall Bloch , whose 23rd birthday party was to be celebrated later that evening at Farmer ' s house . While at the store , Farmer also purchased Terrors From The Clit , which he would later use as ejaculatory fodder in a wholly unironic session of vigorous masturbation ." Guys , check out this one , " Farmer told Werner and Tedesco while browsing a row of videos . " Terrors From The Clit , starring Nikkie Love , Porsha and Intrusion ! We should totally get this and make fun of it at the party . Wouldn ' t that be hilarious ? "Continued Farmer , closely studying the photos of naked women engaging in graphic sex acts on the back of the box : " Dude , it ' s supposed to be a horror movie , except instead of all the chicks getting killed by the zombies , they have sex . Is that the dumbest thing ever ? "After nearly 15 minutes of wisecrack filled browsing , the men exited the store , having purchased a ' Lola Lungs ' inflatable doll , a set of racy undergarments with which to festoon the doll , two packages of novelty glow in the dark condoms and the ironic videotape .Approximately 30 minutes before Bloch was due at the party , Farmer suggested to fellow partygoers that they have Terrors From The Clit playing when he arrived ." I forget Josh ' s exact words , but he basically was saying how it would be a sublime paradigmatic shift between Marshall ' s expectations and empiric reality if he walked into the party and saw us watching porn , as if that ' s what we normally do , " Tedesco said . " Hence , you know , the irony . Get it ? "Farmer ' s friends rejected his suggestion , telling him they would prefer to spend the remaining pre party time preparing snacks . But Farmer did not give up , making several requests to view the tape during the actual party ." He kept saying , ' Dudes , we have to remember to watch that stupid video , ' " Tedesco said . " So we finally gave in and watched the thing . "Those present said Farmer watched Terrors " with great interest " from start to finish , deriving great ironic enjoyment from every scene ." He kept laughing and pointing out stuff in the movie , like how horrible the acting and music was , and saying stuff like , ' Oh , I ' m so sure that would really happen ! ' " Werner said . " We were all just totally cracking jokes and making fun of it . But no one more than Josh : He was making smart ass comments non stop . "At approximately 2 a . m . , the party finally began to dissipate , and Bloch , gathering his gifts from the evening , reached for the Terrors videotape . According to witnesses , Farmer immediately stopped him , saying , " Wait , Marshall , you gotta let me borrow that . I have to show it to my brother when he ' s in town next week . He ' ll think it ' s so hilarious . "Bloch agreed , and minutes after the last guest left his apartment , Farmer put the video back into his VCR and hit play . Unfastening the zipper on his pants , Farmer watched the video and began stroking his penis without humorous intent . He achieved orgasm some 12 minutes into the viewing , ejaculating into his cupped left hand in a manner that neither inverted nor subverted any thematic paradigms .Despite Farmer ' s repeated insistence that his viewing of the tape was strictly ironic , most experts familiar with the case are unconvinced ." It appears that Mr Farmer , despite his derisive stance toward Terrors From The Clit while in the adult bookstore , ultimately enjoyed it in a wholly sincere and heartfelt manner , " said Georgetown University sociology professor Dr William Campos . " He was somehow able to derive genuine entertainment from a most unlikely and counterintuitive source a video so distasteful and poorly executed that he purchased it specifically to mock it . "" For all his initial misgivings , Josh managed to overcome his ironic stance and simply enjoy the thrusting , grunting performances on their own merits , " Campos said . " How he did it , we do not yet know . But I am definitely going to need to borrow this tape for research purposes . Perhaps through the exhaustive eye of scientific scrutiny , I believe we can get to the truth at the heart of this mystery . " 	 1
city of dis, nether hell after nearly four years of construction at an estimated cost of 750 million souls, corpadverticus, the new 10th circle of hell, finally opened its doors monday. the blockbuster video sponsored circle, located in nether hell between the former eighth and ninth levels of malebolge and cocytus, is expected to greatly alleviate the overcrowding problems that have plagued the infernal underworld in recent years. the circle is the first added to hell in its countless millennia history. " a nightmarishly large glut of condemned spirits in recent years necessitated the expansion of hell, " inferno spokesperson antedeus said. " the traditional nine tiered system had grown insufficient to accommodate the exponentially rising numbers of hellbound. " adding to the need for expansion, antedeus said, was the fact that a majority of the new arrivals possessed souls far more evil than the original nine circles were equipped to handle. " demographers, advertising executives, tobacco lobbyists, monopoly law experts retained by major corporations, and creators of office based sitcoms these new arrivals represent a wave of spiritual decay and horror the likes of which hell has never before seen, " antedeus said. despite the need for expansion, the plan faced considerable resistance, largely due to the considerable costs of insuring construction projects within the kingdom of lies. opposition also came from hell purists concerned about the detrimental effect a tenth level would have on the intricate numerology of hell's meticulously arranged allegorical structure. in 1994, however, funding was finally secured in a deal brokered between blockbuster ceo wayne huizenga and satan himself. prior to the construction of the tenth circle, many among the new wave of sinners had been placed in such circles as hoarders and squanderers, sowers of discord, flatterers and seducers, violent against art, and hypocrites. hell authorities, however, say that the new level, the circle of total bastards, located at the site of the former well of giants just above the frozen lake at hell's center, better suits their insidious brand of evil. frigax the vile, a leading demonic presence, is one of the most vocal supporters of the new circle. " in the past, the underworld was ill equipped to handle the new breed of sinners flooding our gates downsizing ceos, focus group coordinators, telemarketing sales representatives, and vast hordes of pony tailed entertainment industry executives rollerblading and talking on miniaturized cell phones at the same time. but now, we've finally got the sort of top notch pits of doom necessary to give such repellent abominations the quality boilings they deserve. " pausing to tear off the limbs of an access hollywood host, frigax added, " we're all tremendously excited about the many brand new forms of torture and eternal pain this new level's state of the art facilities will make possible. " among the tortures the corpadverticus circle of total bastards boasts : the never ending drive thru bank, the bottomless pit of promotional tie in keychains, and the dreaded chamber of emotionally manipulative home shopping network products. the circle also features a hall of aerobics, where condemned tv exercise show personalities, clad in skin tight spandex outfits soaked in flesh dissolving acid, are forced to exercise for centuries on end, covered in vomit and prodded with the distended ribs of skeletal, anorexic demons, accompanied by an unending, ear splittingly loud dance remix version of the 1988 rick astley hit " together forever. " in a nearby area, corporate raiders are forced to carry the golf clubs of uneducated hispanic migrant workers from hole to hole for eternity, withering under a constant barrage of verbal abuse from their former subservients as crows descend from trees to peck at their eyes. in one of the deepest and most profane portions of the circle, unspeakable acts are said to be committed with a mail order roly kit. " in life, i was a salomon brothers investment banker, " one flame blackened shade told reporters. " when i arrived here, they didn't know what to do with me. they put me in with those condemned to walk backwards with their heads turned all the way around on their necks, for the crime of attempting to see the future. but then i sent a couple of fruit baskets to the right people, and in no time flat, i secured a cushy spot for myself in the first circle of the virtuous unbaptized. now that was a sweet deal. but before long, they caught on to my game and transferred me here to the realm of total bastards. i've been shrieking for mercy like a goddamn woman ever since.

US politicians vote to ban entry to the country for Syrian refugeesStinging rebuke to President Obama as dozens of Democrats help pass bill effectively blocking resettlement to United States of refugees fleeing Syria and IraqUS President Barack Obama speaks during his press conference at the G20 Summit in Antalya , Turkey ? Photo : EPAThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a bill that effectively blocks the resettlement to United States of refugees fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq .In a stinging rebuke to President Barack Obama , dozens of Democrats joined a near unanimous decision by Republicans to pass a bill would effectively require the directors of the FBI and national intelligence to personally approve the permission for each refugee allowed into the country .The White House , who dispatched representatives to congress to lobby Democrats hours before the bill , had promised to veto the measure saying it " would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world .

The incident took place near the Jinnah International Airport here after the joint action committee which represents all unions of PIA gave a complete strike call for today despite the government enforcing Essential Services Maintenance Act ( ESMA ) under which all union activities were suspended and employees told to report on duty .At least three persons were shot dead and 12 others injured on Tuesday during clashes between security forces and staff of Pakistan International Airlines protesting at Karachi ' s international airport against the planned privatisation of the ailing national flag carrier .The clashes led to the disruption and then suspension of many domestic and international flights around the country ' s main airports .The incident took place near the Jinnah International Airport here after the joint action committee which represents all unions of PIA gave a complete strike call for today despite the government enforcing Essential Services Maintenance Act ( ESMA ) under which all union activities were suspended and employees told to report on duty .Though two of the protesters died of bullet wounds , Rangers and police denied opening fire at the site .A third patient succumbed to his wounds later in the night .Following the deadly clash , PIA Chairman Nasser Jaffer announced tonight that he has resigned from his post .He expressed grief over the deaths of the PIA employees and lamented at the events which lead to their deaths . " My conscience doesn ' t allow me to head the organisation anymore , " he said ." I have resigned from the post , " the PIA chairman told TV channels while in tears .The PIA chairman said that he has sent his resignation to the prime minister .Jaffer said he was resigning since no one was willing to to accept his advice anymore and even the joint action committee did not try to resolve the matter through dialogue .Kamran Afzal , the Deputy Inspector General ( East Zone ) , has denied that the police backed by paramilitary rangers had opened fire on the protesting employees including women ." The police fired tear gas shells and used water cannons but no shots were fired . Police officials on duty say gun fire was opened from within the crowd .

The man , who can only be identified as Mr R , was handed an order preventing him from seeing his children or entering his street . Mr Justice Peter Jackson ( above ) overturned the order at appealA father suffered a Kafkaesque injustice when he was thrown out of his home without warning and effectively barred from seeing his six children for five months , a High Court judge said yesterday .After being banned from his street , the man was later jailed overnight and convicted of a crime for phoning his wife .Mr Justice Jackson accused lawyers and courts of injustice due to ' unproven allegations ' .The father , named only as Mr R , was barred from his home after his wife took out a non molestation order .He was also forbidden from contacting her except via her lawyers .Such orders are designed to protect women from domestic violence .But Mr Justice Jackson said the ban was granted ' in proceedings of which Mr R was unaware ' .The hearing before a district judge on June 20 lasted no more than five minutes .Mrs R ' s lawyers did not attempt to contact her husband and he knew nothing of the order until he came home from work one day later that month .Despite the claim that his wife was in danger of violence , she allowed him to stay overnight and he left the following morning .Days later , he was arrested for an ' innocuous breach ' of the order after calling his wife to ask about the case , Mr Justice Jackson said .She phoned police and he was held overnight and taken to court .With no lawyer , he pleaded guilty to breaking the order , and was sentenced to a day in prison .' He was a man of good character who now has a criminal record , ' Mr Justice Jackson said . ' And the effect of the original order was to deprive him of contact with his children for fully five months . All in all , Mr R could be forgiven for feeling like the hapless protagonist in Kafka ' s The Trial . 'The novel tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote authority , which never specifies the crime he is supposed to have committed .The man was handed the order after his wife went to London ' s High Court ( pictured ) . Mr Justice Peter Jackson said Mr R could be forgiven for feeling like Josef K in Franz Kafka ' s 1925 novel The TrialThe Trial is the terrifying novel about Josef K , a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested .The book , which was written in 1914 but not published until 1925 a year after author Franz Kafka ' s death follows Josef K ' s need to defend himself against the charge about which he can get no information .It details his struggles and encounters with the law and the courts following his arrest , which came on his 30th birthday despite the fact he had committed no wrong doing .Mr Justice Jackson said that following marriage problems , Mrs R had contacted solicitors in May , hoping to persuade Mr R to leave .The lawyers applied for a court order , saying the wife was at risk of harm . They claimed Mr R had shoved her , thrown objects , and had pushed her to the floor 17 years ago .The application added that the wife had previously been expected to ' engage in distasteful sexual practices ' and that her husband had controlled the finances .But Mr Justice Jackson said the only recent incident listed was a row over a credit card bill and that the order was ' entirely unrealistic ' .It was five months before an appeal reached the High Court , which ruled the order should never have been made . It found 11 injustices by the courts that granted and maintained the order .The father , who can now see his children , told the court in a letter he was ' disillusioned with the justice system which removes me from my home and family with a completely fabricated statement ' .A police report said Mrs R begged officers not to arrest Mr R over his phone call and that her solicitor had told her to contact them .Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article . 	 0
Putin , Cameron pledge to join forces to eradicate Islamic StateRussian President Vladimir Putin ( R ) meets with British Prime Minister David Cameron on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Antalya on November 16 , 2015 . ? Mikhail Klimentyev AFPRussia and its Western allies must set aside foreign policy differences and join forces to defeat Islamic State in the aftermath of the horror of the Paris attacks , Russian President Vladimir Putin told UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the G20 summit .The recent tragic events in France show that we need to ? and should have a long time ago ? join forces in the fight against this evil , Putin said ahead of the meeting with the British leader in Antalya , Turkey on Monday morning .Obama , Putin talk Syria Ukraine on sidelines of G20 summitAdmitting to strained relations , Putin said : As far as bilateral relations are concerned , they are not at their best , but there is some upturn .The West has accused Russia of targeting moderate rebel groups in Syria in an attempt to wipe out opposition to President Bashar al Assad . Relations between the West and Russia took a nosedive in 2014 over the conflict in eastern Ukraine .However , both Putin and Cameron have indicated a desire to cooperate and compromise in light of the changing nature of the IS threat following the mass terrorist attacks on Beirut and Paris last week .We have our differences with the Russians , not least because they ve done so much to degrade the non ISIL IS opposition to Assad , people who could be part of the future of Syria , Cameron said on Sunday .But the conversation I want to have with Vladimir Putin is to say Look , there is one thing we agree about which is we d be safer in Russia , we d be safer in Britain , if we destroy ISIS IS .He said the UK would be prepared to make compromises in order to work with Russia on tackling IS , noting it is important to have Russia s support in finding a diplomatic solution in Syria .Cameron also said he supports extending airstrikes against IS from Iraq into Syria , but he pledged not to take the vote to Parliament without first establishing public support for action .Monday s talks were the first time the leaders had met face to face since last year s G20 summit in Brisbane .The meeting s message echoed Putin s Sunday talks with US President Barak Obama , during which Obama urged Putin to back the West s attempts to thwart IS . During the discussion , Obama welcomed efforts by all nations to confront the terrorist group ISIL IS and noted the importance of Russia s military efforts in Syria focusing on the group . 	 0
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has sent out the clearest message yet that he is not ' over ' old flame Jose Mourinho .The Russian Billionaire , was on his knees begging Jose not to leave according to captain John Terry , after a tear stained split with the Portuguese heart throb . He has now tried to make Jose jealous by starting a relationship with Mourinho ' s ex , Andre Villas Boas .Chelsea Relationship Coach , Ray Wilkins , has told the press that this is the action of a deeply sensitive and love sick man :" Roman still has the hots for Jose . All the lads do . Jose ' s dress sense was truly immaculate " .The scorned Roman took the break up with ' bad boy ' Jose badly . His subsequent knee jerk reactions showed how much Jose had hurt him .The bitter Russian ' went ugly ' with brothel creeper Avram Grant before Jose had even packed his bags , then dumped poor Avram to embark on a " purely animal fling " with ageing Brazilian playboy Phil Scolari .But according to Chelsea ' s overlapping full back Ashley Cole , Abramovich was putting on a brave face and moped around like a lovesick teenager after getting the elbow from ' The Special One ' : " He started wearing a baseball cap and became very moody " .Roman then had a revenge fling with chubby Italian doormat Carlo Ancelotti . Didier Drogba told reporters : " He had no real feelings for Carlo . He just led him on " .Meanwhile , the brazen Jose rubbed Roman ' s big nose in it by openly having a couple of one night stands and an erotically charged public slanging match with Barcelona stud Pep Guardiola .Roman , hiding his true feelings , turned to old flame Gus Hiddink for comfort . But he got knocked back by the ageing Dutchman , who told reporters :" I am sick of being second best . He is just using me to get back at Jose " .Now the forlorn Abramovich has turned in desperation to Jose ' s apprentice Andre Villas Boas .The eager 33 year old Mourinho lookalike spent the weekend on Roman ' s yacht in St Tropez and has been given a lot of money to turn himself into the new Special One .Chelsea fans and players are hoping it " works out " and that Roman Abramovich can now " move on " . 	 1
oregon occupation leader bundy urges remaining protesters to go homeburns, ore. the leader of a month long armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in oregon on wednesday urged remaining protesters to leave the site and go home, a day after his arrest and the death of a supporter. ammon bundy, who was taken into custody with several members of his group at a traffic stop along highway 395, north of the malheur national wildlife refuge in southeast oregon, urged federal authorities to let his comrades leave the compound without being prosecuted. " to those remaining at the refuge, i love you. let us take this fight from here. please stand down... please go home, " bundy said in a statement read by his attorney, michael arnold, following a court hearing. a total of eight occupiers had left the compound by late on wednesday and three were arrested, including jason patrick, who had been with bundy's group in oregon since the beginning and was acting as a spokesman for the holdouts, the fbi said in a statement. it was unclear how many people remained inside the refuge. brandon curtiss, a member of the pacific patriots network, which has been acting as an intermediary between law enforcement and bundy's supporters, said the fbi informed him of patrick's arrest. the three taken into custody face a federal charge of felony conspiracy to impede federal officers. patrick told reuters by telephone on wednesday that some protesters were leaving, but rejected the word " surrender. " " i don t know what surrendering looks like, " he said. " they re walking through the checkpoint and going home. that's what i've heard unless i'm being lied to. " citing the investigation, authorities declined to say what led to the fatal shooting of a member of bundy's group, identified by activists as robert lavoy finicum, a rancher who acted as a spokesman for the occupiers. bundy's brother, ryan, was wounded during the traffic stop. the protesters were each charged in u. s. district court in portland with conspiracy to use force, intimidation or threats to impede federal officers from discharging their duties. the defendants were ordered held without bail until a detention hearing set for friday. the malheur takeover, which started on jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, was a flare up in the so called sagebrush rebellion, a decades old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the west. at a news conference earlier in the day, state and federal authorities pleaded with the remaining occupiers to quit their protest, saying they were free to leave. " let me be clear : it is the actions and choices of the armed occupiers of the refuge that have led us to where we are today, " said greg bretzing, special agent in charge of the fbi's office in portland. " they had ample opportunity to leave the refuge peacefully and as the fbi and our partners have clearly demonstrated, actions are not without consequences. " federal officials say they had probable cause to arrest finicum, who told nbc news earlier this month that he would rather die than be detained. at the same news conference, harney county sheriff dave ward, his voice breaking, said, " i'm disappointed that a traffic stop yesterday that was supposed to bring peaceful resolution to this ended badly. multiple law enforcement agencies put a lot of work into putting together the best tactical plan they could, to take these guys down peacefully. " this can't happen anymore. this can't happen in america and it can't happen in harney county, " ward added. reactions to the takeover from residents in burns, about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the refuge, have included sympathy for the imprisoned local ranchers whose plight began the protest, to distrust of the federal government, and dismay at the armed occupation by individuals seen as outsiders. many residents said an armed protest was taking legitimate grievances too far, and leaders of a native american tribe have urged the occupiers to leave, saying they were scaring the community and that the protesters ignorance of the region s real history was offensive.

BAGHDAD As the Coalition Provisional Authority prepares to hand power over to an Iraqi led interim government on June 30 , CPA administrator L . Paul Bremer publicly touted the success of Operation Iraqi Freedom ." As the Coalition ' s rule draws to a close , the numbers show that we have an awful lot to be proud of , " Bremer said Tuesday . " As anyone who ' s taken a minute and actually looked at the figures can tell you , the vast majority of Iraqis are still alive as many as 99 percent . While 10 , 000 or so Iraqi civilians have been killed , pretty much everyone is not dead . "According to U . S . Department of Defense statistics , of the approximately 24 million Iraqis who were not killed , nearly all are not in a military prison . Bremer said " a good number " of those Iraqis who are in jail have been charged with a crime , and most of them have enjoyed a prison stay free of guard dog attacks , low watt electrocutions , and sexual humiliation .U . S . Brig . Gen . Mark Kimmitt explained the coalition ' s accomplishments in geographical terms ." There are vast sections of the country where one can go outside unarmed during the daylight hours , " Kimmitt said , speaking from a heavily guarded base outside of Baghdad . " Even in cities where fighting has occurred , many neighborhoods have not been torn apart by gunfire . And , throughout the country , more towns than I could name off the top of my head have never been touched by a bomb at all . "Kimmitt said the bulk of the nation ' s public buildings are still standing ." Throughout the nation , four out of five mosques have not been obliterated , " Kimmitt said . " That ' s way , way , way more than half . Also , 80 percent of the nation ' s treasures and artifacts have not been destroyed by artillery or stolen in the widespread looting . If we were in school , that ' d be a B minus . "Halliburton executive vice president and CFO C . Christopher Gaut described the progress of his company ' s reconstruction efforts ." Of the millions of civilian homes that are still standing , many have electricity for hours each day , " Gaut said . " The loss of 200 million in profits resulting from oil line sabotage pales in comparison to the millions of dollars that remaining lines are generating . And a good portion of southern Iraq currently has access to fuel . Once we get the lines in the north repaired , oil fields will be operating at more than two thirds of their former capacity . "Gaut added : " Many of the hospitals have reopened , and a good number of the schools have started holding classes at regularly scheduled hours , too . "Charles Sawyer , a State Department official serving as a liaison between coalition forces and the Iraqi interim government , said that no Americans have been killed in Fallujah since the coalition ceded control of the region to an Iraqi brigade ." Less than 10 contractors have been murdered , publicly mutilated , or had their remains hung from a bridge since the end of March , " Sawyer said . " And nearly three quarters of the foreign born contract workers taken hostage in the last six months have not been killed . Also , contrary to headlines that claim there are problems with Iraq ' s internal law enforcement , more than half of Iraqi police officers have not deserted . "U . S . Army Gen . John P . Abizaid gave a positive assessment of the status of U . S . troops in Iraq ." Yesterday alone , 137 , 980 American troops were not killed , " Abizaid said . " All in all , if we keep on like this , more than 90 percent of the brave men and women serving in Iraq will return home to see their families again . "Iraq ' s new prime minister , Iyad Allawi , agreed that the situation in his soon to be independent nation is improving ." Of the 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council , 23 survived until the group was replaced last month , " Allawi said . " Nine out of 10 times , death threats against those who cooperate with coalition efforts do not end in actual murders . "However , Allawi added that , despite the wishes of most of his countrymen , the vast majority of American troops deployed to Iraq are still there . 	 1
Tehran His wife advised him not to go . His friends said it was too dangerous . But in 2011 veteran American football coach Dan Gaspar ignored the warnings and traveled to the Islamic Republic of Iran Washington ' s longtime political nemesis to help Iran ' s national football team qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil ." Sports is my life , " said Gaspar . " When I came to Iran it didn ' t have anything to do with political reasons . My personality is one of adventure and curiosity . I wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world I had never been to . "The goalkeeping coach ' s journey to Iran is the latest chapter in an international career that ' s taken the 58 year old from the amateur football leagues in the U . S . state of Connecticut where he was born to the football capitals of the world .The Portuguese American ' s resume includes stints with Major League Soccer ' s NY NJ MetroStars and the Portuguese national team featuring megastar Cristiano Ronaldo which qualified for the 2010 World Cup .In 2011 , Gaspar ' s friend and former colleague Carlos Queiroz was named head of coach of Iran ' s national football team . Soon after , Queiroz invited Gaspar to join the coaching staff in Iran .At the time , the Iranian government was locked in a bitter political feud with Washington . Iran regularly called the U . S . " The Great Satan " .U . S . politicians frequently described Iran as a rogue nation led by a radical regime , secretly building a nuclear bomb .When discussing Washington ' s conflict with Tehran , U . S . President Barack Obama said that " all options are on the table " , suggesting an attack against Iran was not out of the question .Despite the ominous climate Gaspar accepted the offer a decision his wife wasn ' t quite comfortable with ." She was shocked , " Gaspar said . " She was concerned as most family members were . "Gaspar admits he had concerns too ." When we first arrived , we didn ' t know how to behave and how to react , " he said .During his first few months Gaspar didn ' t socialize much and rarely left his apartment , except for trips to football practice .But Gaspar says he steadily started feeling comfortable .He says he learned his impressions of Iran , created mostly by the media , didn ' t quite match reality ." When you listen to the news and you read the news , you see things . Sometimes during commercials I step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it ' s not what I am seeing , it ' s not what I am reading , it ' s not what I am hearing . "Gaspar says what he has observed during his stay in Iran is a nation full of generous people who love their country , their food and their football team .One of his most memorable moments was meeting former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ." He walked on to the pitch and asked everyone to sit down , and then he himself sat down on the grass , " Gaspar said . " I thought it was interesting how he put himself on the same level as everyone else . At the end of the day I saw him as another human being . "In recent months , Gaspar ' s stay in Iran has coincided with a push by Tehran to improve relations with Washington , as moderate President Hassan Rouhani tries to settle Iran ' s nuclear dispute with the west ." Right now more than ever there seems to be a lot of hope and optimism and a sense of energy that things will get better , " says Gaspar . " For me I believe in peace , and , if peace is an end result , then that ' s best for the world . "But the highlight of Gaspar ' s Iranian adventure came on the night of June 18 , when Iran ' s national football team recorded a 1 0 win over South Korea to qualify for the World Cup for only the fourth time .The win sparked frenzied celebrations on the field and in the streets of Tehran ." There were a lot of tears , a lot of hugging . You can ' t describe it . Only a few privileged people have the opportunity to climb the mountain and go to the big dance in Brazil in 2014 .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) Chinese tourism authorities are seeking investment to build a novel concept attraction the world ' s first " women ' s town " , where men get punished for disobedience , an official said on Thursday .The 2 . 3 square km Longshuihu village in the Shuangqiao district of Chongqing municipality , also known as " women ' s town " , was based on the local traditional concept of " women rule and men obey " , a tourism official told Reuters . Already , phone lines have been ringing off the hook from Dominatrix ' s from all corners of the globe ." Traditional women dominate and men have to be obedient in the areas of Sichuan province and Chongqing , and now we are using it as an idea to attract tourists and boost tourism . We all know how kinky business men love to get domineered by beautiful aggressive women " the official , surname Li , said by telephone . " We expect this town to generate Millions of US dollars in the first year , and by the 5th year to be approaching a Billion per year , as word spreads " .The tourism bureau planned to invest between 200 million yuan ( 20 million dollars ) and 300 million yuan in infrastructure , roads and buildings , Li said . We are expecting a population boom in the millions within the first 10 years , and we will need to make the area habitable for all who come . Although we know they are here for the women or to control the men , we have to have the facilities to make this area " home " ." We welcome investors from overseas and nationwide to invest in our project , " he added . We will take all the money we can get to make this idea , a reality . Too many fat slobs and weak men out there need attention and dominance of a strong woman .The motto of the new town would be " women never make mistakes , and men can never refuse women ' s requests " , Chinese media have reported . Already , the women have gathered together with ideas of requests they will make to the men . Among them , gay sex , beastiality , genital tortures , and watching Golden Girls .When tour groups enter the town , female tourists would play the dominant role when shopping or choosing a place to stay , and a disobedient man would be punished by " kneeling on an uneven board and servicing any willing stranger " or washing dishes in restaurant , media reports said . Punishments go into many different arena ' s , but humiliation is always the root . Some have said , the will force their men to wear diapers and never be allowed into a public restroom . They will tote turds in their diapers to show others they have done wrong .The project , begun in the end of 2005 , was expected to take three to five years to finish . Women are getting impatient and will soon punish the workers on the project to speed things up ! 	 1
Washington The Vice President ' s office announced today that it has sold the American rights to punctuation of the English language in an auction which had not been advertised to the public the winners will choose the new names for the characters .Spokesperson Dan Druff answered queries about the amount of money raised by saying " I ' m not really at liberty to discuss that . " When pressed for further explanation by reporter Helen Thomas , Druff , plainly exasperated , added , " Look : there ' s an undisclosed location for people who won ' t take ' Huh ' for an answer . " Also missing was any description of where the money would go . " It will be taken care of , that ' s really all that ' s important . "One reporter muttered , " It kind of gives new meaning to ' The buck stops here ' " .The amount is reputed to total well over ten billion dollars from winning bids by several different prominent corporations which see a chance to increase their name recognition and gain more market share . There were questions about the legality of at least one of the products made by a winning bidder .Say hello to some old friends under their new names :Some reporters at the press conference were confused by the last two entries . " What is ' Quorn ' ? " asked one afterwards . " I thought Phen fen was illegal , " said another . " Are they buying something else besides the rights to some punctuation ? "Quorn is a British food product made from mycoprotein fungus . The company expects to triple its market share in the US in just a few months as the name becomes more well known . " It cost us a tidy packet , but it ' s certainly worth it , " said spokesperson Henry Hibbington Smith . " Honestly , we would pay more if we had to . "In a similar vein the press was shown a videotape of another of the Vice President ' s projects , although this one is still in the planning stages . Druff explained that once the office saw how much money corporations would pay for the rights to English punctuation it was a no brainer to auction the rights to the letters themselves , naming them after the winners . The only requirement was that the name actually begin with its letter ." It ' s pretty obvious that the bidding wars will be intense , " he said , " but sometimes you have to show people how these things can work before they really understand . For example , ' E ' is the most common letter in the English language . Now , who would get the most benefit from owning that one ? "The tape showed small children spelling out the Pledge of Allegiance , hands over hearts :" Intel Pepsi Lexus Exxon Dupont Gap Exxon . . . " 	 1
GLENDALE , AZ Retired building contractor Bud Easler , 67 , who ordinarily patronizes Vic ' s Barbershop , informed Studio Quest hairstylist Gina Nardo Sunday that he just wants " a regular haircut , without all the frou frou . "" The wife dragged me along on one of her all day shopping expeditions , and right next to her shoe store was this hair place . I knew Mary would be looking at shoes for a long time , and I was due for a little trim , so I figured what the hey , " Easler said . " Big mistake . "" The second I walked in the door , I knew it was trying to be one of those frilly dilly places , " Easler said of Studio Quest , which bills itself as " a European style salon and day spa with professional services at affordable prices . " " I sat down in the chair , and right off the bat , this Gina gal was all deep cleansing conditioner this , collagen shampoo that . I just wanted my hair a few inches shorter , and that ' s it . "The frou frou started before Easler had even reached Nardo ' s chair . Upon telling receptionist Kirsten Mills that he wanted a haircut , Easler was asked if he would like a manicure or body treatment , as well ." I sure as heck don ' t look like no lady , so I don ' t know why she was asking me about a manicure , " Easler said . " And as far as a ' body treatment ' goes , I didn ' t know what on Earth that was , but it sure sounded funny , so I just said no without even asking what it was . "Easler ' s refusal hardly streamlined the haircut process , however ." I usually just like to sit in a chair and maybe flip through a magazine while Vic or one of the other fellas cuts my hair , " Easler said . " But this Gina gal , she had a question every step of the way . Did I want guava essence shampoo or wildflower with extract ? Would I like to see a list of microdermabrasion scalp exfoliators ? Did I want vitamin E and a sea algae moisturizing spritz ? So I say to her , ' Look , if you want to maybe shave the back of my neck , that would be fine . ' "Before she began cutting , Nardo rubbed what Easler described as " some sort of fancy oil " into his scalp . She then put a towel over his head and left him for five minutes while the substance soaked in ." The gal just took off , " Easler said . " So after a few minutes , I looked around the joint and said , ' Yoo hoo ! Where are you ? I hope you didn ' t forget about me ! ' Then she came back . " When she returned , Nardo explained that she had applied a regenerative conditioning scalp treatment with warm mineral soak , which was included in the price of the haircut . She added that , from the looks of Easler ' s ends , he " really needed it . "Throughout the session , Nardo recommended a number of skin procedures Easler should consider having done . According to the stylist , years of neglect had dried out Easler ' s pores , making him a prime candidate for a deep pore cleansing facial , which includes a skin analysis , steam treatment , and enzyme masque .Easler declined the facial . Undeterred , Nardo began giving him a one minute mini scalp massage , which " serves to reinvigorate tired follicles . " Easler quickly cut her off , insisting that he didn ' t have a lot of time , and that he just wanted " your basic trim . "" I told her my follicles were fine and that I just needed a quick , regular , old fashioned haircut , " Easler said . " Even my wife can ' t shop forever . " 	 1
In this country we pride ourselves on being a technologically advanced nation . Sure , we may not be in the league of Japan or the USA but we are definitely no slouches . That is why a recent survey by electronic games retailer E Games has come as such a shock to many by revealing that more than 10 million children in the UK still do not have access to a copy of Guitar Hero .Among those concerned by the survey are members of the rock fraternity . Former British rock legend Floyd Henderson , a long standing fan of the game , was one of the first to air his disbelief ." This may seem trivial to many people , but I can assure you that the consequences could be dire . America has already overtaken us as the main exporter of rock music and if we don ' t increase the distribution of this game I can ' t see us turning things round in the future . "Floyd is not alone in expressing concern at what these statistics could mean to us Professor Miles Stone , an expert in post 60 ' s music at the University of Brunel , agrees ." Although kids do not learn how to play a musical instrument as a result of this game , what it does is allow them to experience being a rock star . We need to hook these kids at an early age or we risk losing the media savvy ones to football , films or reality television . "The Great Class Divide in RockIt is not only the music industry that has expressed its concern . Bob McKinley , spokesman for the Think Tank Dickensian Times , has a very different fear . " Did you know that almost 80 of the children without Guitar Hero come from the poorest 20 of our population ? I for one fear a future where rock star becomes yet another career path that is only open to the rich . "Appallingly the government has so far refused to comment on the survey .Now I am aware that many people will read this article and dismiss it out of hand . I will therefore leave you with a terrifying thought expressed by Floyd Henderson . " If we do not increase the distribution of this game then we risk all the music produced in this country being controlled by Simon Cowell . " I for one am sure that nobody wants to see that happen . 	 1
Lenny Harper ( pictured ) fears the details of child abuse victims may have been leakedThe details of hundreds of child abuse victims may have been leaked after officials failed to post sensitive documents securely , a former senior investigator fears .The year long inquiry into historic claims that children were molested in care homes in Jersey is currently under way .Police have taken 1 , 776 statements in connection with 532 offences with the 191 victims all entitled to anonymity .But former Jersey police chief , Lenny Harper , fears their details may have been accidentally leaked after a confidential document posted to him by inquiry officials arrived in an opened envelope .Mr Harper , who looked into reports of child abuse on the island in 2007 and 2008 , said the Jersey Care Inquiry sent him the 200 page document to sign , but failed to send it by recorded delivery .He said the post office in the UK had resealed the package in a plastic bag because it had been damaged and inserted a letter of apology for the condition .Mr Harper has given evidence at the inquiry into reports of abuse in the island ' s children ' s homes and fostering services and said the document had contained ' the most sensitive information ' .Former Jersey police chief , Lenny Harper , outside the Haut de la Garenne care home , which shut in 1986Many victims were targeted in the Haut de la Garenne care home which closed in 1986 .He said : ' There are details of alleged abusers , there are details of many victims and what victims were saying happened to them .' There are details of allegations of corrupt behaviour by officials in Jersey and many other details of a sensitive nature .' It could cause a lot of distress to a lot of people .' My main concern obviously would be the victims who gave accounts of what had happened to them in confidence at that time . 'The Jersey Care Inquiry said in response to Mr Harper ' s claims that it has ' deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post ' .In a statement on their website , it says : ' The Inquiry is in contact with a wide range of witnesses , some of whom are on the island and some are not .' Much of our contact with witnesses is by telephone or electronic , but sometimes it is necessary to send documentation through the post , particularly to witnesses who are not on the island .' The Inquiry has deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post , which is sent in plain , non branded envelopes or plastic document bags in the normal post .' The Inquiry by necessity has to use the postal service on the island .' The Inquiry views with concern the reports from Mr Harper that his private mail has possibly been tampered with and has been in contact with Mr Harper . ' 	 0

Tehran , Iran Iran has put the stoning sentence of a woman convicted of adultery and murder " on hold , " Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told state run Press TV on Wednesday .While the statement did not differ greatly from previous , sometimes contradictory reports from the Iranian government about the fate of the woman , Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , it did indicate continued attention to the murder aspect of her case ." The sentencing of Ms . Ashtiani for adultery has been stopped and ( her case ) is being reviewed again , and her sentencing for complicity in murder is in process , " Mehmanparast said .Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning , but her son and human rights activists urged help for her this summer , prompting an international outcry .There have been conflicting reports about the murder charge , which relates to the death of Ashtiani ' s husband . Ashtiani ' s previous lawyer , Mohammad Mostafaei , said last month his client had been sentenced to death for the crime but that the sentence was commuted because the victim ' s family forgave her .Ashtiani , however , told the British newspaper The Guardian last month that she was acquitted of the murder in 2006 . Ashtiani , who spoke to the newspaper through an intermediary , said the man who actually killed her husband was identified and imprisoned for the crime .Mehmanparast said those concerned about Ashtiani ' s condition should have some consideration for the family of the victim , according to Press TV ." Defending a person on trial for murder should not be turned into a human rights matter , " Mehmanparast said .Ashtiani gave an interview to state run TV last month in which she said she knew about a plot to kill her husband but that she had not taken it seriously at the time ." The man entered my life and fooled me with his words and said let ' s kill my husband , " she said in the interview , which was criticized by human rights groups . " He fooled me and said I ' ll do this for you , what a bad husband , I ' ll take care of you . He was my husband ' s cousin , and he said things about my husband ." Then I realized , when I went to prison , he had a criminal record and that this was his third criminal record , and when he said we should kill my husband , I couldn ' t even believe him or that my husband would die , I thought he was joking , that he had lost his mind ." When my husband ' s mother was at our house one day and I went to get her medicine , I saw him there with all the tools he had bought , including electrical tools , wires and gloves . Then he killed my husband by connecting him to electricity with the electrical wires . He had told me beforehand to send my kids to their grandmother ' s house . "The prosecutor of East Azerbaijan Province , Malek Ajdar Sharifi , said on the same program that " the deceased was given an injection to fall asleep by his wife , then the man arrived and put him into the bath and put two electrical lines on his body and killed the deceased . "The human rights group Amnesty International criticized the interview , saying Ashtiani may have been coerced . 	 0
New York Hold on to your hat and your pants and shirt as well . The outgoing mayor is calling on his subjects to strip naked with the goal of turning New York City into the world ' s largest nudist colony .The proposal comes after Mayor Mike Bloomberg ' s Wild West policing style was shot down as unconstitutional . However , the lame duck mayor denies that he ' s taking any retaliatory action ." This has nothing to do with stop and frisk , " he told reporters . " We believe that by turning New York into the world ' s first clothing optional metropolis , we will start a tourism boom that will give us maximum bang for the buck ." The fact that citizen nakedness will physically prevent anyone from carrying a concealed weapon of any kind will be a positive bonus . "Of course , not everyone will be naked at any given time under the mayor ' s plan . He intends to install barbed wire enclosures throughout the city that will " concentrate " unclothed groups into manageable nudist " camps . "Times Square ' s Naked Cowboy has been put in charge of the sorting , named to head the new Alternate Side of the Strip Department . " We ' re thinking of offering a free tattoo to anyone who cooperates to help us keep track of it all . "Former Congressman and active exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has been selected as the city ' s first Commissioner of Social Media And Social Diseases ." We think that title has a nice ring to it , " Bloomberg said . " And we wish Anthony Weiner all the best , as he moves forward And backward . Backward and forward . You go , Weiner boy . "In keeping with the " open city " theme of his proposal , the mayor repealed all prostitution laws . He did however sign new legislation , which reduces the size of a medium soda to eight ounces . " We don ' t want people sharing soft drinks with their hookers , " Bloomberg said . " That could be very unsanitary . "Although the nudist colony plan has to be approved by the City Council , the municipal marketing department has already created a campaign to promote the tourism aspect of the effort . It proclaims : " Naked New York . We ' ll bend over backwards to show you a good time . " 	 1
Hillary Clinton announced she ' s picking Joe Biden as her Vice President running mate . Naturally , Bernie Sanders is shouting foul , as he defended her on her emails and using the bathroom during the last debate ." Thanks , but you ' re not getting the Vice President position . "Just a year younger than Bernie Sanders , but with those veneers , tan and ban ray sunglasses , Joe could pass as Bernie ' s son . Joe also knows politics . He stopped the bleeding during his debate four years ago against Republican Vice President candidate Paul Ryan , ( following Obama ' s napping session during his first debate with Mitt Romney ) .Joe is said to be thrilled . " Means we don ' t have to move . Sixteen years in one place , does that give us squatter ' s rights to keep the place once Hillary ' s gone ? "That ' s a second constitutional question experts will have to research . The first is Canadian born Ted Cruz ' s insistence he is a US natural born citizen .Wrong .But no one wants to drop the net on Ted Cruz . Cruz became a US citizen in 2005 , and he claims he ' s had dual citizenship since born in Canada . So there ! The whole thing has been settled . No more questions and let ' s get on with the election .Canada , not necessarily an authority to ignore , announced that there is no such thing as dual citizenship in Canada .Trump was rumored to have asked : " Can ' t the guy understand English ? So Canadians say hooose and we say house . Tomato , tomato , potato , potato , they ' re good people up there , but they don ' t speak our language . If immigrants don ' t learn our language , they can ' t assimilate into American society . But even if they do learn the language , immigrants can ' t run for President . They ' re immigrants ! Maybe Cruz should run for Prime Minister of Canada . Ship him back to Saskatchewan or wherever he came from . So he has anchor children . So what ? "Meanwhile , Joe Biden is happily unpacking , and Bernie Sanders is ticked and threatening to run as a third party candidate . That would give the White House to Trump ." Whoa , Nelly , " said Joe . " I ' ve already unpacked . Maybe we can appoint you Secretary of Grump . " 	 1
Asteroid LO0R011 was identified early on Monday morning by the NASA Asteroid Detection Agency ( NADA ) . It ' s orbit has been calculated to have it land somewhere near Beijing with enough force to wipe out all life on earth except for a cockroach living in a garbage can in New York . At quarter past twelve , GMT ( naturally ) , a week on Thursday ." This is a particularly hopeless situation , " said Benjamin Downs , of NADA . " We ' re completely out of ideas . "According to Downs , the asteroid is far too close to push off course using lasers , painting one side of it white , or attaching rocket motors to it ." All this will do , " he said , " is make it hit Shanghai and not Beijing . "Nuclear warheads are an option , but NADA are reluctant to employ them ." We don ' t really want to go go the nuclear route for a couple of reasons , " said Downs . " Firstly , we don ' t have a rocket powerful enough to reach the asteroid until it ' s virtually a meteor secondly , all that will happen is that a flaming ball of radioactive rock will hit the Earth . This will also wipe out the New York cockroach . "The Chinese , however , are not so ready to give up . It being their city that will be flattened first ." We have a plan , " said Chew Wing . " We are getting together one million Chinese men , whilst fifteen million Chinese man women and children make a massive piece of paper . Eight hundred gramme paper , none of our usual export paper . "According to Wing , this paper will be stretched out in the path of the asteroid as it crashes through the atmosphere ." We ' re confident this will work , " said Wing . " Paper does beat rock . Our only risk is if somebody brings scissors to the party ! " 	 1
ELKHART , IN Jesus Christ insisted to reporters Monday that He has " absolutely never spoken " to Philip Burkett , rejecting the 48 year old Lutheran college administrator ' s claim of having " a close , personal relationship " with the prominent savior ." I categorically deny having had any prior contact whatsoever with Mr Burkett , " said Christ at a press conference called to quell rumors of a Christ Burkett dialogue . " At no point have I ever conversed with this man . "Christ was responding to remarks published in the July issue of the Elkhart Lutheran College alumni newsletter , in which Burkett said he decided to become the school ' s Assistant Director of Student Affairs at the urging of the Messiah ." It was in 1994 that I answered the Lord ' s call , " Burkett wrote . " Since then , I ' ve been here in Elkhart , doing His work . "Burkett , who was an analyst at an Indianapolis marketing firm at the time Christ allegedly spoke to him , said he had been feeling dissatisfied with his career but " just didn ' t know where to turn . "" It was during the height of my discontent that , following a Sunday service at my church , I quite involuntarily found myself drawn to the bulletin board in the vestry , where a job vacancy was listed for an administrative post at a Lutheran college up in Elkhart , " Burkett said . " It was if some inscrutable force was guiding me . I now know it was Jesus Christ , telling me it was time for a change . "Christ denied being anywhere near the Indianapolis church , explaining that he was " speaking to a sickly young boy " in Asunci n , Paraguay , at the time of the alleged conversation ." Just what that ' inscrutable force ' was , I cannot tell you , " Christ said . " But I do know it was not Me . "" What was his name ? Bartlett ? Beckett ? " Christ asked . " I have a hard time telling those middle class suburban types apart . "Despite the Messiah ' s denial , Burkett said he is convinced that the voice he heard was that of Christ ." Perhaps Christ ' s insistence that He never spoke to me is His way of testing my faith , " Burkett said . " But whatever it is , I still want to give bounteous thanks to God ' s only son for bringing me more happiness and contentment than I ever dreamed possible . "According to Burkett , additional proof that he had spoken to Christ came shortly after he completed his interview for the administrative position . Still uncertain whether such a radical career change was advisable , Burkett happened to drive past a rural cemetery , where he saw a small , cross shaped tombstone , before which grew a single white rose ." It looked just like Luther ' s Rose , the sacred emblem of Lutheranism . Suddenly , all my doubts fell away , " Burkett said . " I am not ashamed to tell you that I had to pull the car over to weep and give thanks , not only because the white rose was Jesus ' way of telling me I would get the job , but because I was continuing His work . "Christ called the flower sighting " a complete coincidence . "" When I first heard that a man in Indiana was claiming I told him to become a Lutheran college administrator , I was sort of amused , " Christ said . " When I speak to someone , I ' m used to them having how shall I put it ? loftier goals than a mid level administration post . This really isn ' t the sort of thing I usually bother intervening in .

Virat Kohli became the first man ever to make three Test centuries in his first three innings as captain and Lokesh Rahul made the first of his career as India fought back on day three of the fourth Test against Australia at Sydney .The hosts had declared on 572 on day two but India produced a brilliant response to reach 342 for five , a deficit of 230 , with Kohli hitting his fourth ton of the series as the pair put on 141 for the third wicket .Rahul had reached 110 when he was dismissed in just his second match while Kohli , in his first match as full time skipper following the shock resignation of Mahendra Singh Dhoni , was undefeated on 140 .VIDEO Confusion in the sky as Steven Smith spills catch and blames spidercamVirat Kohli celebrates and acknowledges the crowd after scoring a century for India against AustraliaKohli raises his bat in the air as he reaches his century on day three of the fourth Test in SydneyIndia ' s Lokesh Rahul looks towards the sky as he celebrates his century against AustraliaIndia began the day on 71 for one and made slow progress in the early stages , adding just 12 runs in the first 10 overs .Despite the slow going , Rohit Sharma brought up his half century off 132 balls but was gone to the next one he faced as he edged a Nathan Lyon delivery onto the stumps to depart for 53 .A major talking point then came three overs before lunch when Rahul did not get hold of a pull off Shane Watson and the ball went flying into the air with Steve Smith looking certain to make the catch .The stand in captain , though , spilled the opportunity and instantly pointed to the sky , suggesting the ball may have hit the ' spider cam ' system of camera wires above the pitch .Both Cricket Australia and the Australian broadcasters later confirmed that was not the case but admitted Smith had been ' distracted by one of the wires in his eye line ' and the fielder looked furious to have spilled the opener on 46 .India captain Kohli hits a shot on his way to a ton at the Sydney Cricket GroundAustralia captain Steve Smith drops a catch off Indian Rahul on day threeSmith looks skywards and points towards the spider cam after dropping a catchA general view of the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday shows the spider cam above the field of playThe rate did not pick up a great deal after the interval but the batsmen were clearly comfortable in the middle , finding the boundary with anything loose , and Rahul moved into the 90s with a six off Lyon .Kohli then reached his half century before the new ball was taken and Mitchell Starc almost had the skipper through the gate first ball but it took a slight inside edge and went to the rope .Smith then put down another chance but this time he had nobody to blame but himself as Kohli got on an edge to a Starc ball and it flew high to second slip where Smith spilled the opportunity above his head .More drama was to come before tea as Rahul , who had recorded scores of three and one on debut in Melbourne , brought up his maiden Test ton off 253 balls as he guided the ball to the rope past gully .Australian bowler Shane Watson ( second right ) celebrates after claiming the wicket of Suresh RainaAustralia captain Smith ( right ) presents his pink cap to Glenn McGrath on Jane McGrath day in SydneyAustralian prime minister Tony Abbott enjoys a drink as he watches the action in SydneyThe crowd , many of whom are wearing pink , cheer during day three of the fourth TestHis joy was short lived , however , as in just the second over after tea he was gone , pulling a Starc delivery high into the air and the bowler claimed the catch himself at the batsman ' s end .That seemed to prompt Kohli to want to race to his century and the right hander joined counterpart Smith in making it four for the series off 162 balls .It had very much been the tourists ' day so far but Watson changed the complexion slightly with two wickets in as many balls in the 100th over .First Ajinkya Rahane was trapped in front for 13 and then Suresh Raina edged to Brad Haddin , who made an impressive catch diving to his left .That could have had India wobbling but Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha ( 14 not out ) made it through to the close with the former becoming the top Indian run scorer in a series in Australia . 	 0
Mogadishu , Somalia A double car bomb attack outside of a hotel in Somalia ' s capital Wednesday night killed at least one person and injured up to a dozen others , police said .Police official Yusuf Ali said the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel , with the second blast from a parked car following as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured . Three of the wounded were security personnel stationed outside the gate .At the time of the Mogadishu blasts , there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the Jazeera hotel . It is believed the injured guards were part of the security detail of government officials .Of the 12 people injured , some were seriously wounded and transported to local hospitals .No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks .Last month , another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded , a government spokesman said .A car bomb went off on November 8 outside Hotel Makkah Al Mukarama in central Mogadishu , Abdikarim Hussein Guled , the African country ' s interior and national security minister , told local media .Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali , the Somalian government ' s former acting envoy to Britain better known as " Dhub , " said Abdirahman Omar Osman , presidential spokesperson .Some of Somalia ' s violence has been traced to Al Shabaab , an al Qaeda linked organization that the U . S . government calls a terrorist group and was behind the deadly siege earlier this fall of a Nairobi , Kenya , shopping mall .A U . S . military drone strike in southern Somalia in late October killed two suspected Al Shabaab members , U . S . officials said .

Seahawks season ends with playoff loss to Panthers as second half rally falls shortOriginally published January 17 , 2016 at 1 : 35 pmPanthers running back Jonathan Stewart breaks away for a 59 yard run on the first play of the game from scrimmage Sunday in Charlotte , N . C . ( Bettina Hansen The Seattle Times )Carolina held on for a 31 24 victory over the Seahawks , who were attempting to become the third team in NFL history to advance to three consecutive Super Bowls .CHARLOTTE , N . C . ? It was a game that mirrored the season ? a halting start that had the Seahawks climbing a steep hill they just couldn t quite scale .Down 31 0 at halftime Sunday in a divisional playoff game against the Carolina Panthers , the Seahawks scored 24 points in the second half to make the outcome ? suddenly in question .But the Panthers recovered an onside kick , and the comeback ? and season ? ended there . Carolina held on for a 31 24 victory and advanced to the NFC title game next weekend against Arizona .The Seahawks were attempting to become the third team in NFL history to advance to three consecutive Super Bowls .Instead , the run ends a game before the conference title game .A 2 4 start to the regular season led to a 10 6 regular season for the Seahawks that forced them to play on the road throughout the playoffs .It proved to be too much to overcome .The Seahawks could not have asked for a worse start ? or Carolina a better beginning .Seattle won the coin toss , but as it almost always does , elected to defer . Carolina s Jonathan Stewart then ran 59 yards on the first play to set up a quick four play , 75 yard touchdown drive to make it 7 0 with 12 : 30 to play in the first quarter .On the second play of Seattle s first drive , quarterback Russell Wilson was heavily pressured and tried to dump the ball off to running back Marshawn Lynch .Lynch , though , didn t appear ready for the pass and Carolina linebacker Luke Kuechly picked it off and returned it for an easy 14 yard TD ? and a 14 0 Carolina lead with 11 : 38 to play .The next time the Panthers had the ball they went on a methodical 15 play , 86 yard drive to go up 21 0 , as Stewart capped it with 1 yard dive over the top for a 21 0 lead with 14 : 18 to play in the second quarter .Carolina QB Cam Newton was 5 of 6 passing for 65 yards on the drive .The Panthers kept the pressure on with an interception leading to ? field goal and then a 54 yard drive for another touchdown to make it 31 0 with 6 : 26 to play in the second quarter .At that point , the Panthers had a 213 17 edge in yards , with nine first downs to one for the Seahawks .The first half ended symbolically as a 54 yard field goal attempt by Steven Hauschka into the side of the field with a little wind came up a little short and right .Seattle then dominated the second half , leading to a few what might have beens as the game ended .The Seahawks used a good Tyler Lockett return and a penalty to start the second half on the Carolina 35 and quickly cashed in , Wilson hitting Jermaine Kearse for a 13 yard touchdown .On Seattle s next possession , the Seahawks again scored quickly , Wilson hitting Lockett for a 33 yard TD in the corner of the end zone ? the second third and 10 conversion the Seahawks picked up on the drive .At that point , Seattle had pulled to within a 225 221 in yards .The quick third quarter scores might have had the Seahawks kicking themselves over the way the first half ended .Seattle moved the ball its own 20 to the Carolina 14 on one drive but came up a yard short of converting a fourth and 5 on a pass to Doug Baldwin , eschewing a field goal they might have wanted later .On the next drive , the Seahawks got the ball back with 1 : 05 left , but then used 55 seconds to run three plays and had to settle for the long Hauschka field goal attempt that came up short .Another critical play in keying Seattle s comeback came with 9 : 20 left in the fourth quarter as Lockett was initially ruled out at the end ? of a 27 yard catch at the Carolina 46 yard line . The Seahawks challenged and won and had a first down instead of third and 10 . 	 0
In the continuing fallout from Johnny Depp whipping off young Turners head Captain Barbossa has weighed in claiming he knew Sparrow was going to throw his mobile at somebody , but didn ' t foresee a beheading .Commodore Norrington is leading the internal investigation with many set members unhappy with Depps drunken stoned rages . " His short fuse will eventually get him to some serious Martin Sheen Grade Crap " , noted Cutler Beckett .Despite local police not pursuing any criminal investigation based on the fact that Jack Sparrow is famous some critics are calling this a double standard and want him to stand trial for at least aiding and abetting the corruption of Walt Disney fans . Depp claims he is " doing no worse than Miley Cyrus to innocent youth and why should he be singled out when he was more famous than her anyway " .Police have also confirmed they used the now famous Census linking key to determine that Jack Sparrow had no known association with Muslims that had cats with unpaid parking fines and he was free to go about his business in Australia .But Captain Teague said he had told him in the last movie " it is not about living , its about living with yourself Jack " .Governor Weatherby Swann has also weighed in stating " he never liked Turner from the start , I mean after all he is only a blacksmith for Gods sake " . He is hoping Turners less than successful head transplant will spurn Elizabeth to seek a more suitable suitor . But he was not hopeful given how hopeless her acting was .But in a surprise statement not towing the party line Davy Jones boomed " I knew Turner was trouble the minute I first saw him and a nuisance throughout the entire 3 movie series and regrets not putting him to the sword himself . As much as I hate Jack Sparrow " , he went on to say " I am glad somebody put a sword through young Turner " . When told he had fed exed Turners head to Amber his soon to be ex wife as spiteful divorce prank , he mentioned that he had Heard that .Boot Strap Bill of course sided with his son though he did admit he had seen Depp stoned on the set quite a lot . He went on to note with that he hoped Disney executives didn ' t figure that out as they might want their money back , as Depp technically wasn ' t acting , he was off his face like that all the time .Charlie Sheen is said to be wrapped with Depps performance on the set and has issued an invitation for him to partner him in a new anger show management show called 2 and Half Rich Celebrity Jerks . Depp is rumoured to be pleased with the scope for personal artistic expression and the special " pissofity clause " which gives him the right to piss off anybody without consequences , " that was about as close to a Greek God as anyone could get " he skited .The remaining half had yet to be announced , but rumours are floating around it could be Martin Sheen walking on his knees . Charlie bragged " Depp isn ' t a Rock Star from Mars but the fuss he is causing on the set is truly the stuff of Hollywood legends and I love to see a brother mastering his craft " . 	 1

The Pro Football Writers of America announced Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton as its Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year for the 2015 season Wednesday . ?The PFWA tweeted Newton ' s selection for the awards after he accounted for over 4 , 400 yards of total offense and 45 touchdowns while leading the Panthers to a 15 1 record .Newton took a major step forward in his fifth season leading the Carolina offense . His 35 passing touchdowns were 11 more than his previous career high , and he posted a 99 . 4 passer rating , which was also a new high watermark ( 88 . 8 in 2013 ) . ? He added more than 600 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground as well .It further established him as one of the league ' s most dynamic weapons at the quarterback position , along with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks , whom the Panthers beat in the divisional round of the playoffs last week .Don ' t expect Newton to celebrate the accolades now , though . In late December , he stated the conversation about the battle for MVP was " irrelevant to me right now , " with his focus on team success , as noted by ? Max Henson ? of the Panthers ' official site ." It ' s a culmination of guys making plays and ( me ) feeling comfortable in the pocket . Everybody is doing their job , " Newton said . " Offensive football is the ultimate team sport . You need all 11 members to do their job . "His success is even more impressive when you consider his merely average supporting cast . Greg Olsen is one of the NFL ' s top tight ends , but the top three wide receivers in yards were Ted Ginn Jr . , Jerricho Cotchery and Devin Funchess ? not exactly a star studded group .Newton has also ? drawn the ire ? of some for his actions on the field , particularly after the Panthers score a touchdown . But it ' s hard to take those complaints too seriously when you see the look on kids ' faces when he ? hands them a football ? after scoring .The Panthers return to action Sunday night to face off with the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game . Newton will need to play at an MVP level to guide his team to a Super Bowl berth . 	 0
BILLINGSGATE POST : Long cut off from the mainstream of American culture , it is no exaggeration to suggest that the white inhabitants of the Appalachian Mountains were transgender pioneers . Geographically isolated throughout most of their history , they were mistakenly thought to be socially conservative by pundits living in the metropolitan areas of The United States .Although their ethos and family values were considered old fashioned , the recent discovery of a three holed outhouse in West Virginia gives question to whether the hillbillies who settled this region were homophobic or social progressives .Found in an upright position by a team from Indiana University Department of Gender Studies led by Dr Melissa Cuthburt , it was immediately noticed that three symbols were etched above the door of the dilapidated structure a male figure , a female figure , and what appeared to be a question mark . Upon opening the door it was noted that this was a three holer , usually a sign that the family had at least three members who liked to poop together .Dr Cuthbert , whose resume included her affiliation with the San Francisco branch of Dykes on Bikes and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence , was initially thrilled to find this important evidence of transgender sexual inclusion among the mountain folk of West Virginia .Alas , after transporting the outhouse back to the Indiana campus for further examination , it was discovered that what was initially thought to be a question mark , was actually a hangman ' s noose that had been partially disconnected at the lower left side of the noose by the ravages of age and weather .Upon further research it was discovered that the noose was a symbol of what would happen to you if you tipped the outhouse over while a family member was using the facility a typical Halloween trick endemic to the region .NOTE : It is important to note that the difference between a noose and a question mark can be as little as three inches . 	 1
PHILADELPHIA Butch Patrick , 58 , a former child actor who appeared on television ' s The Munsters , has announced plans to write an autobiography on the word processor he just purchased for 11 , yard sale sources confirmed Saturday .Patrick , who from 1964 to 1966 played the role of Eddie Munster on the CBS sitcom about a family of monsters , discovered the Smith Corona personal word processing typewriter at a rummage sale , where it was sitting on a blanket in the grass . He immediately picked up the device and reportedly carried it around while browsing to prevent another savvy customer from swooping in and buying the piece of used electronic equipment ." I ' m really lucky I didn ' t get here five minutes later , because I ' m certain it would have been long gone , " said Patrick , adding that he got a great deal on the word processor and that it would be " perfect " for finally getting his memoirs down on paper . " This thing probably costs a bunch of money at RadioShack now , but I got it for a steal . And the best part is , I even got a discount . "" There are perks to being famous , " Patrick continued .According to yard sale organizers , Patrick was very excited about the electronic typewriter , approaching several strangers perusing items on a folding table to explain the machine had a couple of small scratches but was otherwise in " pretty great " condition . Patrick also pointed out on numerous occasions that the word processor had a screen that displays several lines of text at once ." This thing is cool , because if you mess up , it ' s not a problem , you just use the backspace button to erase the mistake , " said Patrick , who reportedly told customers the technology would cut down on his autobiography ' s production costs , because he would not have to buy correction tape . " It ' s loaded with features that are going to make my book look tremendous . You can change the margins , center words on the title page . "" When you ' re in show business , you need everything to look very professional , " added the man whose last major role was in 1971 on the Sid and Marty Krofft show Lidsville , in which he played a teenage boy who magically enters a world of living hats .Patrick also informed customers his new purchase would significantly expedite efforts to complete the first draft of his autobiography ." I ' ve already got about 30 pages down on hotel notepads a lot of the first season Munsters stuff , " Patrick said . " So I just need to transfer it to this . It also has a floppy disc drive so you can save the work and don ' t have to retype everything if you lose a chapter . "While Patrick assured everyone at the rummage sale his autobiography would compile numerous anecdotes from his early years working on a hit TV show , the 58 year old said the book would primarily focus on his life after television and contain stories about struggling with drug and alcohol abuse , finding work in Hollywood , and appearing at promotional events and meet and greets nationwide .Saying it was highly unlikely publishers would pass on a chance to buy his life story , Patrick explained that even if his manuscript was rejected , he would still be able to use the word processor to print out copies he could sell at comic book conventions and memorabilia shows .Linda Brunner , who hosted the yard sale on her front lawn , said Patrick repeatedly mentioned that he starred in The Munsters before inquiring about the price of the typewriter ." He kept saying how people were always asking him his favorite thing about being on The Munsters or if things changed on the set after his sister was replaced by a different actress or something , " Brunner said . " I told him the word processor was 14 bucks , but then he just got this crestfallen look on his face , so I gave it to him for 11 . He got really excited when I threw in about 40 sheets of typing paper . "" He seemed interested in a sandwich maker I was selling , but just sorta shook his head and mumbled something like , ' You can ' t pull it off , Butch , ' " Brunner added .Sources estimated Patrick " hung around " the yard sale for approximately an hour after purchasing the word processor , eventually buying two button up shirts and encouraging shoppers to attend this year ' s GhoulCon . 	 1

" What am I , a saint ? " moans Mary , mother of Jesus of Nazareth . " Why do these sketch artists and sculptors keep stalking me , trying to reproduce my image on canvas and stone ?

"The non material girl , also known as The Madonna , has been made accidentally famous by the notoriety of her oldest son , Jesus Christ , the long awaited Messiah of the Jewish people . While her CD sales skyrocket , she laments that fame isn ' t always what it is cracked up to be ." The stories these tabloids make up about me are ridiculous . Yes , I do consider the Star of Bethlehem my Lucky Star . and Yes , I was a virgin when God the Holy Spirit came rested upon me .

That ' s stuff is all strange but true , " said Mary .She continued , " But now I read that I am a ' perpetual virgin , ' whatever that means .

As I walked through the canteen I thought of Alan queuing up for his lunch with us mere mortals , he shared ."

Being back in those corridors made me remember a lot of things and I will treasure those memories all my life . He inspired my career more than he ever knew . "Daniel Radcliffe also remembered the actor in an emotional post shortly after his death was announced .On his Google Plus page , Daniel wrote : Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with .He is also one of the most loyal and most supportive people I ve ever met in the film industry ."

And certain things obviously became even funnier when delivered in his unmistakable double bass .Daniel , 26 , also revealed that he will carry the lessons that Rickman taught him throughout his life .Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career , he wrote .Film sets and theatre stages are all far poorer for the loss of this great actor and man .

A discussion in which Hasselbeck and O ' Donnell debated the meaning of the word " terrorist . " O ' Donnell asked , " 655 , 000 Iraqi civilians are dead . Who are the terrorists ? The media , particularly Fox News , accused O ' Donnell of calling U . S . troops terrorists .O ' Donnell explained during the next show that she was referring to U . S . policies not the " men and women who were sent there by the politicians and had to obey orders . I never called our troops terrorists . "On the show O ' Donnell accused Hasselbeck of not defending her against the false charge by media outlets . She called Hasselbeck a " coward . " Answered Hasselbeck : " You are an adult , and I ' m not going to be the person for you to explain your thoughts . . . . Defend your own insinuations . "On Friday , Hasselbeck was the surprise guest . It was Barbara Walters ' s idea . She hoped the two could resume their friendship , such as it was , before the blow up when the two did exchange numerous e mails on non political topics .O ' Donnell would not smile at the surprise guest , let alone hug her . Instead she said , " You never would look me in the eye and say that I didn ' t call our men and women terrorists . Do it now . And while you ' re at it admit that the Tea Party Express are a bunch asses and that Bush was a moron for invading Iraq . "Hasselbeck declined . Instead she , who is now a host on " Fox And Friends , " said " Rosie I ' ve always hated you for your feminism . "" Feminism a threat to national security because men are no longer able to be ' manly . ' "She shot a piercing look at O ' Donnell and continued , " Men have to be men .

ilse knecht has worked with victims of disturbing voyeuristic trends such as " upskirting " and " downblousing. " one woman showered for years in a swimsuit after a peeping incident involving her landlord, knecht said. others stopped wearing skirts entirely. " victims say people don't understand the impact of this crime, " said knecht, a policy expert at the washington based national center for victims of crime. " it feels like a combination of a kind a sexual assault and stalking. it is very harmful. " the subject of modern day peeping toms made national headlines this week when massachusetts'highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography. the controversial decision overruled a lower court that upheld charges against michael robertson, who was arrested in august 2010, after police set up a sting following reports that he was using his cell phone to take " upskirt " photos and videos of women without their knowledge. " a female passenger on a mbta ( massachusetts bay transportation authority ) trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is'partially nude,'no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing, " wrote justice margot botsford of the state supreme judicial court. in massachusetts, prosecutors and state lawmakers called for a revision of the law. after state house speaker robert deleo said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly, the house and state senate on thursday passed a bill making " upskirting " illegal, with the measure going to the governor for signing. armed with smartphones, ipads or other high tech gadgetry, peeping toms are snapping pictures of unsuspecting women in public places and sharing the images on the web. keyword searches on web browsers and social media sites such as facebook and instragram turn up multiple hits for " upskirting " and " downblousing " sites displaying surreptitious images of women's private body areas. " there's an epidemic around street harassment broadly, but also we've received tons of'upskirt'reports as well, " said emily may, executive director of ihollaback. org, a web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photographs of harassers and peeping toms. " i think there's a fear among people that you could have an'upskirt'photo taken of you and never realize it. your crotch could be on the internet and you may never know about it. " knecht said some states have taken steps to deal with high tech peeping, but many others have failed to update antiquated voyeurism laws that are on the books. in florida, for instance, video voyeurism is a felony. washington state changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces. knecht said states such as kentucky, mississippi, new hampshire, new mexico, north dakota and wisconsin have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the web a crime. in 2004, congress passed a federal law making it a crime to photograph people's " private area ( s ) " on federal properties, including national parks and military bases or to broadcast such images. but states are responsible for making high tech peeping a crime elsewhere. " we don't know how many ( incidents ) happen and victims don't know about it, " knecht said. " but when the cases do come, i think that we need laws that cover them. what we know about these cases is, it's not only one picture taken for somebody's personal gratification. that happens sometimes. but other times people are taking the pictures and putting them on the internet and they're going even international. it's not just one instance of victimization, it's many. " susan gallagher, a professor of political science at the university of massachusetts lowell whose specialty is gender, privacy and politics, said that stricter " upskirting " laws could make the practice more tantalizing to voyeurs. " it's only because it's creepy that people do this, " she said. " you could see obviously a lot more of women's bodies in other places.'upskirting'doesn't really reveal much of women's bodies. you could see way more on the internet if you just wanted to. " she added, " i think the only thrill is the surreptitiousness of it. she doesn't know. she's 	 0
Markets Tue Feb 2 , 2016 10 : 54pm ISTSterling hits 3 week high on draft proposals to keep Britain in EULONDON Feb 2 Sterling touched a three week high on Tuesday after the outline of a proposed EU deal said Britain does not have to integrate further politically with the rest of the European Union if it wants to stay in .The proposals addressed all four areas where Prime Minister David Cameron has demanded reform , but they were met with a mixed reception that underlined the challenge of convincing Britons they should stay in the bloc . The reforms must still be agreed by other EU leaders at a summit later this month .The pound rose to as high as 1 . 4447 after the draft proposals were published , up from 1 . 4380 immediately beforehand , and its strongest since Feb . 13 . Later , it eased back a touch , to 1 . 44 , leaving it down 0 . 2 percent on the day .Sterling had earlier fallen to as low as 1 . 4328 after a survey on Britain ' s construction sector showed growth slipped to a 9 month trough in January , denting expectations of a pick up in gross domestic output .Against a broadly stronger euro , sterling fell 0 . 4 percent to 75 . 725 pence , having strengthened to as low as 75 . 615 pence after the draft was published .ING FX strategist Viraj Patel wrote to clients that he recommended selling the euro against sterling . He said short term " Brexit " newsflow around may actually be positive for the pound , and that the Bank of England was likely to be neutral on the issue when it releases its Inflation Report on Thursday .Furthermore , Patel said , sterling should benefit over the coming weeks from less jittery global markets , and the euro was likely to be weak in the lead up to the European Central Bank ' s March meeting , where more easing is expected to be announced .Cameron has been locked in talks with European Council President Donald Tusk , who announced the proposals on Tuesday , to win what he calls the " best deal possible " for Britain while keeping other EU states onboard before a referendum , which could take place as early as in June .Though the draft proposal had been expected today , its content had not been clear in advance . ETX Capital currency dealer Richard Wiltshire in London said the fact that there had been perceived progress on all four areas of Cameron ' s demands had boosted sterling ." In an otherwise thin and lacklustre day . . . that news of real progress has given sterling a little fillip , " he said .The cost of hedging against big changes in sterling ' s exchange rate against the dollar over the next six months had earlier hit a 9 month high of 9 . 85 percent , but fell a touch after the proposals were published .

Washington , D . C . According to the US Census Bureau , 3 out of every 4 Americans now make up 75 of the total US population ." If you think about it , based on an estimated population of close to 296 million , 75 would be about 222 million people ! " reflects Timothy Tuddel , a statistician at the Bureau . " Imagine the implications of this data , considering such a large percentage falling into this category " .According to the latest figures , 3 out of 4 Americans making up 75 of the population is up considerably from 1975 , when 2 out of 3 American ' s made up only 66 . The stark contrast is even more visible when compared to 1933 data , when only 1 out of 5 constituted a mere 20 ." We ' re looking at this data and trying to determine what this could mean in both the near term and long term future for the population " Tuddel tells a group of reporters " it ' s very possible that our population will top 300 , 000 , 000 within the next two years . At this rate , it ' s quite possible that we ' ll see as many as 240 million people representing 80 of the population . That translates to 4 out of 5 ! "Many advocacy groups and lobbyists are alarmed at this new data , concerned that the current trend may soon exceed 100 ." At the current rate , it ' s very possible that by the year 2015 , we may actually begin to seen the numbers flip flop , maybe reaching 11 out of every 10 , or even 12 out of every 9 , we simply can ' t let this happen " says Senator John Kerry , " this can all be traced backed to the irresponsible policies of the Bush administration and how he has constantly lied to the American people " .Of course , there are two sides to every story and where some people see doom and gloom , others see opportunity . Leading commercial marketing groups are trying to find new and innovative ways to tap into this every growing percentage of the population ." We ' re still trying to digest this information and determine exactly what it means . The one thing we are sure of is that 75 of the entire population is huge ! If we can tap into that market with a more focused advertising campaign , well , the sky ' s the limit ! " theorizes Craig Williams , president of Williams Marketing in Wasconga , Montana ." Whether you view the numbers as an impending crisis or a boon of opportunity , we ' re not likely to see much of a reversal , at least not in the near term . " Says Tuddel , " we were really hoping to see something more along the lines of maybe 70 , we could better deal with that , but unfortunately , the math couldn ' t support it . Quite simply , 3 out of 4 doesn ' t lie , it ' s clearly 75 " 	 1
Although Cedrick Wilson has been released from the Steelers for punching his girlfriend , the NFL brain trust is hard at work to keep all of that talent hard at work .While the high profile problems plaguing the NFL are threatening the league ' s well earned reputation as the premier stage within the lucrative entertainment industry , the league seems ready to fight back with all of the marketing muscle and business innovation that it is famous for .According to our informed sources , the NFL is green lighting further research into a new type of expansion program . And , unlike the NBA , the NFL is not eyeing a Woman ' s Football Conference . No , not a women ' s conference , but nevertheless we may see a new conference in the NFL to go with the current National Football Conference and American Football Conference , whose champions meet each year in the SuperBowl .How about the Prison Football Conference ? That ' s right , the NFL is seriously considering a conference of teams comprised of incarcerated " prisoner athletes " . If your first reaction is " How can they do that ? " , the estimate is that a conference of 3 or perhaps even 4 competitive teams could be assembled to play in an abbreviated season of 6 to 8 games .Legendary NFL Draft guru Mel Kiper , Jr . , when questioned about the plan , said , " 4 teams would be easy . Just by pulling talent from the California state penitentiary system we could field 2 different teams that would kick the sh t out of last year ' s Oakland Raiders . "Not surprisingly , some current NFL players are enthusiastic about the prospect . When asked , one Pro Bowler was quoted as saying , " I never know when I might get on the wrong side of the police again it would be nice knowing that I could still play . You know I ' m trying to stay clean and all , but sometimes you can just be in the wrong place at the wrong time . " Other players were more skeptical , with one player saying . " I didn ' t wish nothing bad on Mike ( Vick ) and all , you know , but I was kinda glad we weren ' t going to have to play him again , feel me ? "The flexibility afforded by a Prison Conference ( already referred to as the " PFC " according to internal documents ) is not lost on the NFL front office . Although when called for a reaction to the story NFL spokesman Greg Aiello predictably had no comment , it ' s easy to see how NFL management could more easily deal with the many transgressions of its players . There would be no more tough decisions on how harshly to deal with the delicate situation of a player facing jail time . It would be a simple process for players to be traded from an AFC or NFC team to a PFC team . Salary caps would be a non issue in the PFC , where players would play for nominal prison wages ( approximately . 30 . 55 per hour ) , and the resulting reduction in overall labor costs would help the league ' s balance sheet across the board .A prison league would address one of the more challenging current issues of player conditioning and team scouting , since players doing time could still display their skills and be " game ready " when they transition back into the general population . The ability to maintain endorsement contracts alone makes the Player ' s Union a strong proponent of the PFC conference . Gene Upshaw , head of the NFL Player ' s Union was quoted as saying , " Hell yes , it ' s a good idea . It ' s about time . " Although it may seem a bit too creative , the plan is a logical move forward for a sport that struggles to manage such a large number of players moving in and out of incarceration . And while the plan does have a long way to go before it could be implemented , there are some aspects already decided : all NFL suspensions would run concurrently with prison sentences ( naturally ) and the league isn ' t ready for PFC teams to be eligible for the playoffs or the SuperBowl .But , in time , who knows ? Based on the direction of things , there may be some flexibility there : it all comes down to the economics of big time sports . 	 1
Double director : Ex chief constable Martin Baker runs two consultancy companies which stands to profit from the commissioner electionsA former chief constable could make thousands of pounds from the taxpayer as a result of this month ' s police elections .Martin Baker suddenly resigned from his 141 , 000 a year job as chief constable of Dorset Police , saying he felt ' the time was right to hand over leadership ' .But only five days after leaving the force , he became a director of two consultancy companies that offer services to the new police and crime commissioners .The candidates standing for the commissioner positions in 41 forces in England and Wales on November 15 are mainly made up of local politicians with little law enforcement experience .This has left an opportunity for former senior policemen to give them advice and administrative help when they are appointed , at a huge potential cost to the taxpayer .Mr Baker , 56 , registered as a director of both One Team Policing and One Team Advisory on October 5 . The name is similar to the motto he helped choose for Dorset Police : ' One Team , One Vision . 'He officially finished his job with Dorset Police on September 30 . Last year he received a bonus of 13 , 000 , and he is entitled to a pension worth two thirds of his final salary or around 90 , 000 a year .The website for both companies state that its professionals provide specialist advice on ' all aspects of law enforcement , criminal justice and community safety ' .Mr Baker joined One Team Policing with two of his former colleagues from Dorset Police . It was set up by former assistant chief constable Mike Glanville and former chief superintendent Gill Donnell in March .Miss Donnell lives with Dorset Police ' s director of human resources Graham Smith . Mr Baker and Mr Glanville are the only directors of One Team Advisory , which offers similar services .Under the banner ' Voice of the people ' , One Team Policing ' s website states : ' We are offering prospective candidates a range of free to use and paid services to support them in advance of the elections including a range of on line campaign services .' We will also be able to provide a range of specialist services to elected commissioners once they take up office . 'Consultant : The website for consultancy firm One Team Policing where Martin Baker is a director alongside former colleague and ex assistant chief constable at the Dorset Police , Mike GlanvilleAs it is a new company , the amount of money it has received has not yet been recorded publicly .But it has been reported that the company has offered commissioner candidates a ' Standard Web Presence ' for 359 and a ' Premium Web Presence ' for 1 , 799 .Among the advice it offers are tips on ' strategic leadership ' , ' cost reduction ' and ' working with the media ' .Police and crime commissioners will not run forces directly but will be responsible for appointing their chief constable , setting out local policing priorities , reporting annually on progress , and setting out the force budget .They will be paid between 65 , 000 to 100 , 000 a year and candidates mainly include local politicians rather than the Government ' s hope of former police chiefs .Patrick Mercer , chairman of the parliamentary sub committee on counter terrorism , said : ' Unfortunately the money that the police authorities have to disperse will make these consultancy roles increasingly attractive to senior officers who are keen to retire and enter private business . 'Miss Donnell said : ' We are delighted that Martin Baker has been able to join us at One Team Policing . His extensive experience in policing will be a real asset to our customers . ' 	 0
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles is to be replaced by a dugong in the General Election .The shock history making revelation was made in an extraordinary constituency meeting in Brentwood and Ongar yesterday . " It was lucky that the meeting was in Brentwood and Ongar " , a Brentwood and Ongar Conservative spokesman said yesterday , " since Eric Pickles is the standing MP for Brentwood and Ongar . If the meeting had been held in another constituency , then the dugong would have replaced the wrong person . "The Brentwood and Ongar Conservative spokesman went on to say : " Conversely , if the meeting had been held in Brentwood and Ongar , but had been about a standing MP from another constituency , then , again , the poor dugong would have been similarly at a loss . "He concluded , positively , that " Brentwood and Ongar is an ideal constituency for a dugong to manage , since it provides a perfect marine environment , with abundant supplies of sea grass , which Eric Pickles has always loved to browse " .We also spoke to marine expert Professor Jens Convolvolus of The University of Jutland , who told us that " this is an ideal replacing of one creature with another of a similar environmental adaptation . The body is sparely covered in the short hairs , which may enable his tactile interpretations of his surroundings . These hairs are most developed around his mouth , which has a large horseshoe shaped upper lip which is a mobile muzzle very useful in his foraging . And the dugong is much the same . "It is believed that Eric Pickles has had to withdraw his candidature because he wants to attend the World Flag Convention which is being held in Shanghai , China the day after the General Election . Mr Pickles is renowned as a great flag enthusiast , or vexillophile , who has for many years been engaged in the design of a new flag for the Isle of Wight .It might be feared that a dugong , who has few natural predators in the wild , might be ill suited to the cut and thrust of the hustings , but we understand that Mr Pickles ' constituency team has delivered an intensive training course to the newcomer . It is believed that this has made the dugong virtually unassailable in an argument . For example , when questioned as to the failure of the Coalition Government to meet its chief targets , it will relentlessly preface its answers with " because of the huge deficit we inherited from the previous government . . . " . Further , when asked where the Conservatives will find the money to fund the extra Health spending promised in their manifesto , the dugong will simply reply " Look at our record . We have a watertight economic plan . Steady growth will deliver results . We must not go back to the economic chaos of a Labour administration . "A huge creature that has a brain weighing 0 . 1 of its body weight , very small eyes in a huge tusked head and a great body usually covered in algae is a ferocious opponent in a political debate . But the Conservatives in Brentwood and Ongar believe that the dugong can be just as formidable . 	 1

With his demise , Mufti leaves behind a void that will be hard to fill even by the strongest of the state ' s politicians . During his lengthy political career of six decades , he carved a niche for himself in national as well as state politics .One of the tallest politicians of Jammu and Kashmir and serving Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed passed away at AIIMS in New Delhi early on Thursday morning . He had been admitted to AIIMS two weeks earlier ? and was suffering from pneumonia .With his demise , Mufti leaves behind a void that will be hard to fill even by the strongest of the state ' s politicians . During his lengthy political career of six decades , he carved a niche for himself in national as well as state politics .Here are five things from his legacy that he will be remembered for :Mufti Mohammad Sayeed created history when he became India ' s first Muslim Home Minister in 1989 . However , Sayeed ' s tenure as Home Minister was marred by the fact that it was around the same time that militancy had reared its ugly head in Jammu and Kashmir and when his own daughter Rubaiya was kidnapped by the JKLF militants . Rubaiya was later released in exchange for the release of five JKLF militants . Rubaiya ' s release for the exchange of the militants for the first time projected India as a " soft state " for the first time .2 . Healing touch policy in Jammu and KashmirSoon after he was sworn in as Chief Minister of the hill state in 2002 for his first stint , Sayeed launched the Healing Touch policy for Jammu and Kashmir . Sayeed ' s healing touch policy when launched was a road map and guiding principle for governance of the state wherein , according to Sayeed himself , " . . . will not change the programme of my government to provide a healing touch to the people and give a new image to the security forces . "As part of the healing touch policy , the J K Government announced the popular elections for the Autonomous Hill Development Council in Kargil , in order to strengthn participatory forms of development , governance and democratic state building in the district . Sayeed ' s healing touch policy also echoed the Centre ' s new stand towards Kashmir and was endorsed by then PM Atal Behari Vajpayee who had said that humanist rahter than constitutional solutions were needed to resolve the Kashmir crisis .3 . Created history by allying with the BJPMufti Mohammad Sayeed created history when he managed to forge an alliance between the BJP as well as the PDP . Soon after he came to power in alliance with the BJP , he had referred to the coalition as a " meeting of north pole and south pole " . Even before he had tied up with the BJP , he knew the challenges since both the BJP and PDP are diametrically opposite to each other in their viewpoints on Kashmir . However , so far the coalition has had a difficult time with the PDP having to back down each time in favour of the BJP .Mufti Mohammad Sayeed always advocated a continued dialogue with Pakistan and believed that trade relations androad and air links would form the basis of normalisation of relations with Pakistan . He believed that there was no readymade formula to solve the Kashmir issue and that ultimately trade , air and rail links would ensure the process of normalisation ofo the overall situation .Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was seen as a crafty politician and was known as the wily man from south Kashmir who was often seen as a unifier and a reconciler of differences . Be it issues such as the reconciliation over Article 370 and AFSPA or ironing out differences with other parties over various issues , Sayeed was a pastmaster at resolving differences . Over the course of his political career , Sayeed made friends even with parties that followed ideologies that conflicted with his party ' s . 	 0
BOSTON , Massachusetts Timothy Connick was in agony for six years . In bed at night , it felt as if a pair of scissors was sticking out of his foot . " I turn over , and it ' s just like they ' re getting jammed in more . "Timothy Connick got relief from chronic pain through a peripheral nerve stimulator implanted above his hip .Connick , 52 from Lynn , Massachusetts , injured his foot falling from a loading dock at work 11 years ago . " I fell about seven feet onto the concrete and smashed my heel . It started hurting that moment and kept hurting for six years after that . "Connick is among millions . As many as one in three American adults suffer from chronic pain , according to the American Chronic Pain Association .The organization defines chronic pain as " pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an injury or illness or that goes on for months or years because of a chronic condition . " It ' s usually not constant , the group says , but can disrupt the sufferer ' s life .Over the years , Connick consulted multiple doctors and tried two dozen medications for pain management , but nothing eased the pain and the resulting depression . " It was pretty much a no win situation as long as that pain was going to be there , " he recalls .He was eventually referred to neurologist Anne Louise Oaklander , director of the nerve injury unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . " Pain is the No . 1 reason why patients seek medical care , but until recently it hasn ' t been part of the medical school curriculum , " she says . " Many physicians and nurses feel uncomfortable and unqualified to treat these patients . "Oaklander sees many patients whom she describes as " bouncing around the health care system " for years with no firm diagnosis . She divides chronic pain sufferers into two groups . " One is the group that has an ongoing cause of their pain , " she says . " The classic example of that is patients with arthritis . They have pain in their joints every day . " Much more difficult , she says , is the second group : " Patients who have chronic pain without an obvious cause of tissue injury . "Connick falls in the second category , Oaklander says , noting that X rays show broken bones , but not nerve damage . " It was only many years later when he was examined by a neurologist that his underlying nerve injury was identified and able to be treated , " she said . Health Minute : The struggle of managing chronic painOaklander says pain medications can help most patients , but there are other options . For instance , she says , if the pain is related to an orthopedic problem , physical therapy may be the best choice .In Connick ' s case , relief came through surgery to implant a peripheral nerve stimulator above his hip . Based on pacemaker technology , the stimulator is placed under the skin and works by giving off benign pulses that override pain signals to the brain , Oaklander explains .She cautions that minor surgery is involved , and the device works in only about half the patients who get it .For Connick , it made all the difference . " The day they put it in and I turned it on , I was up seven flights of stairs before they stopped me . Everything that I hadn ' t been able to do and everything that made me happy was back available to me again and I knew it right away . "These days , Connick is back at work loading trucks . He ' s on his feet all day and doesn ' t complain about any pain .Oaklander concludes : " If you have chronic pain , don ' t take no for an answer . . . . I think it ' s important for chronic pain patients to keep a sense of purpose , optimism and hope despite the indignities that many are subjected to . " E mail to a friend 	 0
WASHINGTON U . S . Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced today the appointment of twenty new translators to its language translation program , a key tool in its fight against terrorist acts against the United States . Stating that they needed to " think outside of the box " when it came to such issues , Mr Gonzales said a central issue in the past had been in hiring linguists who could only speak one language , or were only fluent in a particular dialect of one language .Mr Gonzales stated that the solution lied in " multiple language " translators , and stated that he was borrowing a strategy recently implemented by California ' s state Homeland Security director , Wilbur Stamps , whose initiative in this matter recently saved a famous state park near the capitol building in Sacremento .Gonzales announced that the new translators were all Pentecostal " tongues interpreters , " a spiritual specialty that allows certain persons to interpret various languages , which is essential in Pentecostal and Charismatic churches where multiple languages are often spoken during worship service as members fall into a spiritual trance . Often , these interpreters are unaware of the language they are interpreting though most assume that they are languages from around the world , or languages spoken in the afterlife , or Heaven .California Director Stamps stated that he was pleased that the Department of Justice was making this a " faith based initiative , " adding that many Pentecostal and Charismatic churches , the fastest growing segment of Christianity within the US , were willing and able to do their part to combat terrorism on American soil .To make budgetary adjustments to pay for this new program , the Department of Justice stated that they were laying off psychic advisors left over from the Reagan White House , and that the federal Department of Homeland security would end the CIA ' s funding of the Stargate Project , an initiative using " remote ( psychic ) viewers " to collect data from around the world .With his arm around Stamps ' shoulder , Gonzales stated " . . . when we ' re talking about using spiritual warfare to combat terrorism , we cannot serve two masters . We choose God . "Stamps introduced the woman who started this new direction in intelligence , a Sacramento woman named Sallie Ploss , whose interpretive abilities recently saved the California State Petunia Garden . After the press conference , the three of them held hands in a small circle and began praying , and Director Stamps began mumbling incoherently . Stamps told our reporter in a phone conversation later in the day that he had indeed spoke in tongues , and that Mrs Ploss had interpreted that the message stated that God had been pleased with the press conference .Prior story : Pentecostal Interprets Terrorist Threat 	 1
New York , NY In a scene that must have been reminiscent of Scarface , New York Yankees ' owner George Steinbrenner on Saturday appears to have envisioned an orgy of acquisitions before Major League Baseball ' s trading deadline . Notes discovered in Mr Steinbrenner ' s home trash paint a picture of a man almost out of control .Below is a selection of quotes taken directly from the scribbled sheets :" Get Nomar for second , what an infield ! ! Jeter at short , A rod at third and Nomar and second , Lucchino will kill himself . "" Need more RBI guys thinking Rolen , Tejada and Ortiz would be nice consider threats of won ' t work "" Our rotation sucks if we can ' t get Johnson , what about Pedro or Shilling ? Why did Cashmen let Clemens go I should kill that little bastard . "" I have the cash , why not bring the payroll over four hundred million screw that tax , I want to create misery . "Major League Baseball officials , when told of these musings , expressed no concern . " George and his dreams are George ' s business , " said Baseball commissionaire Bud Selig , " If he has the will and financial wherewithal to pull them off , more power to him . It would be good for the game if he were able to create a truly unstoppable force . "Peter Gammons , of ESPN , was not so sure . " It seems that if Mr Steinbrenner were allowed to proceed along the lines indicated by these notes , there would be no telling where things would stop . If would create such a competitive imbalance not just on the field , but in terms of advertising and broadcast revenue that plenty of teams would simply go under . "Additional notes seem to indicate that Mr Steinbrenner had an unprecedented level of hegemony in mind as he sat in his home plotting on Saturday afternoon . " Fans deserve the best illegible team that money can buy . I have the money and the Yankees are America ' s team . Anyone that stands in my way is just a illegible liberal . I am the Lord of the Rings , look how many of the damn things I got ! ! "Yankee ' s general manager Brian Cashman confirmed that Mr Steinbrenner was exploring some unconventional ideas prior to the trading deadline but denied he wanted to become tyrannical in any way . " Simply throwing money into a line up isn ' t the Yankee way . " explained Cashman , " We have prided ourselves on our deep pockets , I mean , strike that please , our deep farm system to keep us number one . And by the way , Little Bastard is a term of endearment . "Mr Cashman ' s Freudian slip sums up the attitude of many people involved with Major League Baseball that the Yankees are an arrogant team that will stop at nothing to win . One final thought from Mr Steinbrenner ' s notes : " Screw them is they can ' t take a joke . "New York Yankees 	 1
Fifteen year olds are the purest pop consumers , concerned only with the here and now of an artist , and untroubled by where they ve been or where they re going . In the early 70s , while the rest of the British public were gingerly working out how to deal with the bisexual Martian who had landed in the charts , teenagers were in love with him .The alchemy Bowie exerted ensured that the front rows of the Ziggy Stardust tour were jammed with them , screaming and clutching at the air between themselves and the stage . A photo of Bowie arriving at the Hammersmith Odeon for the last Ziggy gig on 3 July 1973 shows his car surrounded by a knot of fans , all of them young and some ? bravely , for the time ? wearing their hair in adulatory Martian quiffs .A contemporary account claims that show was almost bacchanalian . According to a fan called Julie , who was quoted in the 1985 book Starlust : The Secret Fantasies of Fans , some of the boys in the crowd were so wowed by Bowie that they tore their clothes off , while others were happy simply to trample the people next to them .Related : Was David Bowie saying goodbye on Blackstar ?I thought it was so extraordinary because nobody had any inhibitions , she told Starlust s author , Fred Vermorel . I remember that around me nobody gave a shit really about doing these things because it was rumoured that maybe this was the last time Bowie would perform .Even those who witnessed it have probably since forgotten that Bowie was once a teen idol . Enshrined in the collective consciousness as British rock s beloved grandee , his last decade was as far removed as it s possible to be from the era of uninhibited , Lurex spangled Ziggy . Yet it s easy to see why he once hit teenagers with such force .As the beautiful androgyne who had been entrusted with a message of hope to the world ? the premise of 1972 s Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars ? he was enormously appealing to people who came of age just as the 60s ended with the tinkle of hippie dreams shattering . There he was , the spaceboy from the future , speaking to teenagers from the outer cosmos via the original version of the internet , also known as the radio .His appearance bespoke endless possibilities : teens are fascinated with remaking and masking themselves , and Bowie was a lightning rod for that ? he d grown up in a tiny terraced house in the unglamorous south London outpost of Sundridge Park , Bromley , and look what he turned into .He even anticipated the effect he d have . The track Starman opened with a couplet that painted a picture any kid in a suburban bedroom would recognise : Didn t know what time it was and the lights were low I leaned back on my radioIt was as if Bowie were in that same bedroom , benignly registering the kid s amazement at being spoken to by an actual starman : I had to phone someone so I picked on you Hey , that s far out , so you heard him too ! Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two Look out your window I can see his light If we can sparkle , he may land tonight . That was powerful stuff : sparkle enough and he might arrive in your street .Related : Bowie in quotes : ' I wouldn ' t like to make singing a full time occupation 'I visited his teenage home last month while making a piece for Radio 4 about suburbia s role in inspiring creativity . Surprisingly , the current owner let us in for a quick look around . Bowie s bedroom , occupied by him between the ages of eight and 18 , was a boxroom upstairs at the back . 	 0
Jubilant British Cyber physicists were last night on the brink of making the most important scientific breakthrough since man first stepped on the moon or so they say . After weeks of painstaking research and endless fruitless experimentation , it is thought that the first CyberSpace probe could now be ready for launch as early as March next year .The probe which will be unmanned will be fired down a giant fibre optic cable at breakneck speed deep into the bowels of The Internet from a secret location near Scunthorpe . " If everything goes to plan we hope to get the first ever pictures of web pages as they travel through CyberSpace before materialising on your monitor screen , " said Professor Norman Animalcup who is at the helm of this adventurous project . " We really don ' t know what to expect , " he added , " but it ' s all very exciting . "Part of the five month long project which has cost an incredible 8 . 3 hundred pounds to date will be to search through CyberSpace to seek out signs of intelligent life .However , this is thought to be highly unlikely at the moment . " Of course , it ' s inevitable that intelligent life must exist somewhere out there deep in the vastness of CyberSpace , but we ' re not banking on finding it at this early stage ." What we do know at the moment is that there are web pages out there containing pictures of Victoria and David Beckham for example , but , alas , these are very primitive forms . "The ultimate aim is to send the first men into CyberSpace . " We certainly have the technology , but it could be very dangerous at the moment , "Professor Animalcup explains . " Even if we did get the Cybernauts back in one piece , they would have to be quarantined for a long period afterwards just in case they ' d picked up any nasty viruses . " 	 1
" Come in , " Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said as I was ushered by an assistant into his study . " I just opened this bottle of wine . Won ' t you join me for a glass ? "When the controversial Italian leader asked me to see him at his villa for this profile , I was , admittedly , a little overwhelmed . I had only graduated from journalism school six months earlier , and already I would be sitting down with one of the most powerful men in the world . But despite my trepidation , I began asking him about the many scandals dogging his tenure , from alleged mafia ties , to accusations of anti Semitism , to rumors that he had hired a teenage prostitute ." No , " said Berlusconi , handing me a glass of Lambrusco that , ooh , is actually a really , really pretty red color . " Not now . The evening is so special . "Undaunted , I pressed him about recent remarks in which he deflected allegations of philandering by saying it was " better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay . " He simply smiled at me and is it hot ? I feel hot .Reacting to his silence , I brought up his vast media empire , and asked whether Italy could truly be called a democracy when its leader controls a majority of the television and news outlets but I don ' t remember taking my shoes off .Some have suggested Berlusconi entered politics only to enrich himself and his companies , and he has since become one of the 100 wealthiest men in the world . First elected in 1994 , it ' s really getting spinny in here , wow , Berlusconi has allowed the country to suffer through garbage strikes , garbage strikes andThis is really strong wine , Mr Busconi . I haven ' t finished my glass , and already I ' m very light headed . Light headed . Whoa , I wonder what my mom ' s doing right now . This is not , you have big hands , I have questions about the " bunga bunga " parties the prime minister held , the ongoing , there ' s , please . Let me catch my breath .Mr Merlusconi ?

hillary clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016? with official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half, clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the united states. win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. just consider the two potential outcomes. a win would mean a woman in the white house, which is a vital step in the march toward women's full political inclusion. but it's possible that the march will end right there. we'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come. we'll raise the " mission accomplished " banner over the women's movement. and we'll call it a day. granted, 80 of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. and pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard clinton might try. " but we've elected a woman as president, " we'll say. let her take care of it. a loss would be even more difficult. clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. more generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. " if hillary clinton can't win an election, " potential female candidates will ask, " how can i? " extrapolating from one female candidate's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. but in the case of clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. first, clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well known today. but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well publicized baggage. voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in iowa, steps onto a debate stage in new hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in kentucky. too often, we treat clinton's loss to barack obama in the 2008 democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. in reality, what people knew about hillary clinton likely shaped their views of hillary clinton. widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. after all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. do some voters still question women's suitability as leaders? of course they do. but these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, don't translate into systematic biases against female candidates. second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. the d or r in front of the candidates'names not the x or y chromosomes in their dna tells us about how more than 90 of the population will vote. party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. now, i'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. the clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. i don't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won't need to consider. but men yelling " iron my shirt " at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers don't change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. if clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for democrats. and if she loses, it will be because the gop developed a winning message. but how much does any of this really matter? sure, voters are amenable to electing women. any democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. the problems confronting 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC The Federal Communications Commission voted 3 1 Monday to require electronics manufacturers to make all television sets ADHD compatible within two years .To adhere to the guidelines , every program , with the exception of The Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Show , will have to be sped up to meet the new standard frame rate of 120 frames per second .FCC Chairman Kevin Martin characterized the move as " a natural , forward thinking response to the changing needs of the average American viewer . "" In the media saturated climate of the modern age , few have the time and energy to sit still for an entire episode of King Of Queens , " Martin said . " Although the FCC will leave it up to the television networks to make the necessary programming changes , we are recommending , in accordance with the ADHDTV standard , that all shows be no more than six minutes in length , and that they contain jarring and unpredictable camera cuts to shiny props and detailed background sets . "" We ' re also advising that intra episode recaps occur every 45 seconds , " he added .The ruling represents a growing shift toward ADHDTV , a television format designed to meet the needs of an increasingly inattentive and hyperactive audience . The tuner includes a built in device that automatically changes channels after three minutes of uninterrupted single station viewing , as well as a picture in picture in picture in picture option .According to Sony , the leading manufacturer of the ADHD compatible sets , the new technology will allow viewers to play up to three simultaneous video games while watching television ." Many of our ADHDTVs will come with a motorized base , " Sony spokesperson Richard O ' Dell said . " In the event that the viewer turns his attention away from the television , it will begin to rotate and emit sirens and piercing shrieks . "The mandate to conform to the new format has already been met with some resistance , particularly from movie channels like HBO , live programs such as ABC ' s Monday Night Football , and the History Channel , whose ambitious five part , 10 hour historical documentary about World War II , slated for completion in late 2007 , will have to be shortened to a six minute montage of the war set to a medley of Ashlee Simpson hits .Some networks , however , are embracing the change ." A majority of our shows are only watchable for a few minutes at a time anyway , " said Fox president Peter Liguori , whose recently unveiled fall 2007 TV schedule includes over 850 new series . " We ' re going to roll out an exciting lineup of major sporting event highlights , late night yell shows , and a brand new season of The O . C . that will feature 37 new characters and well , I don ' t want to give too much away , but let ' s just say it will have a lot more guys jumping up and down , saying , ' Hey ! Hey ! Look over here ! ' "On standard 4 : 3 televisions , ADHDTV programs will be shown in letterbox format , with the top and bottom of the screen alternately filled with bright , flittering butterflies , undulating rainbow colored patterns , and singing hamsters in top hats .Skeptics say the switch to ADHDTV will likely be delayed in favor of other projects or even completely forgotten by next week . However , the FDA is fast tracking approval of the new drug Entertainalin , developed in anticipation of the modified programming . In clinical trials , the drug has been effective in helping viewers concentrate not only on the new TV format , but also on their immediate surroundings , the couch fabric , a dog passing by the window , and pieces of lint floating in the air . 	 1

LOS ANGELES , California ( ABSNN ) The LA County District Attorney ' s office declined to charge " tween star " Justine Bieber , 18 , for a " fight " he had with a photographer last May . According to an Assistant District Attorney , " In all seriousness , we could not charge Bieber because everyone knows he ' s such a pussy that no jury would ever believe he could even throw a punch a tantrum , maybe but not a full grown photographer who out weighed him by 75 pounds . "Bieber threatened to sue LA County District Attorney Steve Cooley for " tarnishing my manlinessnous . "Bieber was alleged to have thrown a punch and kicked at paparazzi outside a restaurant where he and then girlfriend Selena Gomez had been eating .However , Sgt . Jack Friday , who worked the case , found no evidence of injury to the unnamed photographer ." The photographer had no bruises , no cuts , no injuries at all . Bieber could not possibly have hit him he was not touched , " said the detective ." No injuries at all , " asked a reporter ." These are just the facts , ma ' am , " Friday said as he read from his notes :" Bieber is such a sissy boy that he hits like a girly girl , kicks like a sloth , and has the hand eye coordination of worm . "" I suggest that the next time Master Bieber wants to have a fight , he should stick his head up his ass and fight for air , " said a disgusted Sgt . Friday .Well , that about sums up this story , but we will keep you informed , if we have to , I guess . 	 1
Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin has missed the last month with a quadriceps injury , but by traveling with his team during its recent Eastern road swing , it was assumed that the forward was soon to return .Follow Dunks Don ' t Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketballUnfortunately , it appears as if he got a little handsy with a member of the team s equipment staff , and that return date might be pushed back a bit .Allegedly , Griffin got into a scrape with a member of Clippers staff after viewing his squad s poor performance against the Toronto Raptors . The hashtag happy SportsCenter anchor Michael Eaves has the tweets :Clippers forward Blake Griffin injured his right hand after hitting a member of the team ' s equipment staff during an argument in TorontoThe altercation started in a restaurant . It proceeded outside where Griffin hit the equipment staffer multiple times . ClippersThis comes after ESPN s Marc Stein relayed the news , calling it a result of a team related activity , prior to pointing out that we won t be seeing Blake for a while :Griffin leads the Clippers in scoring at 23 . 2 points per game , while adding 8 . 7 rebounds and over five assists a contest in what was a fantastic start to the season . The Clippers , however , have got along just fine in his absence , winning 11 of 14 games . The team has dropped two of three on its current road trip , however , and has to face down both the Pacers and Hawks before being allowed to skip back to El Lay .Griffin will be out four to six weeks with the broken hand , the team announced Tuesday afternoon . A midpoint of five weeks would return Griffin to the team just in time to face the Thunder ( twice ) , Hawks , Mavericks , Warriors , Spurs , Rockets , Grizzlies , Knicks and Cavaliers all within an 11 game span .The Clippers also said they are investigating the incident ." This conduct has no place in our organization and this incident does not represent who we are as a team , " said Clippers in a statement .? Marc J . Spears ( SpearsNBAYahoo ) January 26 , 2016LAC : " Conducting a full investigation with assistance from the NBA . At the conclusion of the investigation , appropriate action will be taken . "? Marc J . Spears ( SpearsNBAYahoo ) January 26 , 2016This means the team will likely play Golden State in the Western Conference semis . The Clippers did not get a chance to take on the Warriors during Golden State s championship run last year , and any bit of pairing between the Clips and a high end opponent is a daunting one : Los Angeles is winless in eight games against high end playoff types like the Warriors , Thunder , Chicago Bulls , San Antonio Spurs , and Toronto Raptors .Who knows if those Raptors ( who put up 44 points in the first 16 minutes of the team s eventual win over the Clippers on Sunday ) had anything to do with this reported altercation ? The Clippers have performed well with Blake on the sidelines , but only against teams they re supposed to perform well against . Even with months to go before spring hits , this is unfortunate timing .Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don ' t Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ?

The White House Press Secretary has just issued a statement announcing the formation of a massive new government agency .This new agency will be responsible for running a number of new Federal programs authorized by President Obama by executive order . This order was recently issued after a janitor at the National Archives reportedly found a long lost page from the Bill of Rights behind an old filing cabinet .In addition to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , this document provides for a government guaranteed " right " to free healthcare , food , clothing , housing and employment for anyone residing in the country .The Obama administration has wasting no time in moving to implement these new " rights " .According to this press release , the name of the new government entity will be the ' Comrades Receiving Assistance Program ' , or C . R . A . P . , for short .President Obama himself talked to reporters and stated that " by the end of his term as President every American will have CRAP Health , live in CRAP Housing , hold a CRAP Job and wear CRAP Clothes . "When questioned about the new " right " to free food , Mr Obama said his advisors were working on the details , but he said rest assured , everyone would be eating some kind of CRAP very soon .So , to summarize , it looks like we may all be moving to Detroit or D . C . to live in our new CRAP Housing projects .We will all be working CRAP Jobs . Those with skills will be either laboring in the sewers or pumping septic systems . Those without any skills will work for the government .The new CRAP Clothing Program means we will also be issued free platform shoes , plaid bell bottom pants and Member ' s Only jackets .And , thanks to CRAP Food , we can all look forward to getting a much bigger portion of crap from Washington than we have ever received before .On the plus side , with the government guarantee of CRAP Health , at least we won ' t live long . 	 1
Beijing , China China and the United States , the largest producers of greenhouse gases , will team up to fight climate change and create clean energy , their leaders said Tuesday .Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Obama said their nations will cooperate to advance technologies and work toward a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions .After Tuesday ' s meeting , Hu told reporters , " We agreed to expand our cooperation on climate change , energy and environment , " which includes developing a China U . S . clean energy research center .The declaration by Hu and Obama comes ahead of next month ' s U . N . Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , Denmark , and follows recent acknowledgment by the world ' s top economic powers , including the U . S . , that there ' s no hope of a major breakthrough on climate change by year ' s end .The U . S . president said the two leaders want to accelerate the world toward a pact to cut greenhouse gases . The leaders did not offer a time frame , however ." Our aim . . . is not a partial accord or a political declaration , " Obama said , " but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect ." This kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge . "Instead of reaching a final deal in Copenhagen , a strategy dubbed " one agreement , two steps " was unveiled at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit over the weekend in Singapore . The aim is to produce a pact over a longer period .The first step would be to have all 191 countries involved in the Copenhagen summit signing on to a framework that includes key ingredients , such as how to finance the coordinated effort to battle climate change . The second step , a binding deal on cutting carbon emissions , would be hashed out in further negotiations ." Opportunity is knocking . It is up to you to open the door , " U . N . Secretary General Ban Ki moon said in a statement Monday . " We must seize this opportunity to create a safer and more prosperous future for all , to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change and to help the most vulnerable adapt to impacts that are already under way . "Like the United States and China , APEC and Group of 20 leaders the world ' s leading economies have pledged to drive toward a climate change agreement in Copenhagen .The conference , set to begin December 7 , aims to strike a deal on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , the 1997 pact that has legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions . The United States never ratified it , though more than 200 other nations did . 	 0
LOS ANGELES At the 86th academy awards the big winner was again perennial favorite White Guilt who topped off his already storied career with his 58th Academy Award for his performance in 12 Years A Slave .Says Guilt , " It was amazing to be part of a film like this it ' s basically like the Staples Easy button , but with Oscars .

Washington The Transportation Security Administration on Friday ordered re testing of all radiation emitting full body scanners after an internal review showed calculation errors , missing data and other discrepancies on paperwork by contractors who routinely check the machines ' radiation levels .As recently as Wednesday , the agency vouched for the safety of the machines , with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano telling a Senate committee that independent studies concluded the machines are " more then safe . "" The amount of radiation is approximately ( the same as that received ) as two minutes in the air , " Napolitano said .The TSA reiterated that position Friday , characterizing problems as " record keeping errors . "But Sen . Susan Collins , R Maine , said the TSA found problems with more than one quarter of the reports it reviewed , " including gross errors about radiation emissions . "" That is completely unacceptable when it comes to monitoring radiation , " Collins said . " If TSA contractors reporting on the radiation levels have done such a poor job , how can airline passengers and crew have confidence in the data used by the TSA to reassure the public ? "The TSA said all " backscatter " full body scanners will be re tested by the end of March , the TSA said . It will also require contractors to re train machine testers , while increasing TSA oversight over the tests .Further , the TSA said it would ask the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) to update its 2008 report .The announcements came as the TSA , responding to public pressure , posted raw data about radiation tests on its website . The agency also promised to post all future radiation checks on the web site for public review .The TSA said its internal review looked at randomly selected reports generated over the last two years at 15 airports . The tests are conducted by manufacturers and contractors ." These reports confirm that each piece of technology reviewed meets all national safety standards , " the TSA said . But , the TSA said , the reports contained " inaccuracies . " Those inaccuracies included " calculation errors not impacting safety , " no reading of background radiation levels , and missing " non measurement related information . "TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Friday that numerous independent tests have confirmed that body scanners are safe , " but these record keeping errors are not acceptable . "" We ' re taking a number of steps to ensure the mistakes aren ' t repeated and the public will be able to see for themselves by reviewing all future reports online , " Kimball said .Marc Rotenberg , president of a privacy rights group and a critic of the full body scanners , said the latest development is " more evidence " that the TSA should suspend use of the machines .A House government oversight subcommittee will hold a hearing on TSA oversight of the full body scanners on Wednesday . 	 0
Aaron Ramsey wants Arsenal to build on their impressive victory over Manchester City by going on a long unbeaten run .Arsenal pulled off one of the most impressive results of the season on Sunday when they defeated City 2 0 at the Etihad Stadium .Arsene Wenger ' s team have a poor record against their top four rivals , but the Gunners rarely looked in trouble during their trip to the north west and the result means they remain within one point of fourth place .Aaron Ramsey has urged his team mates to build on their impressive 2 0 win at Manchester CityArsenal striker Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring against Manchester CityRamsey battles for possession with City captain Vincent KompanyArsenal would be much higher in the table had they performed more consistently this season .The Gunners have not won more than two successive Barclays Premier League games this season , but Ramsey hopes that will now change in light of Sunday ' s victory over the champions .' We have got a lot to play for this year so hopefully now we can build on this performance and that will give us even more confidence going into the business end of the season , ' the Arsenal midfielder said .' There is still a long way to go in this league . Many teams are taking points off each other . We will just have to concentrate on our own game and hopefully go on a big run and see where that takes us at the end .' It was important to win because all the other teams won . The pressure was on us .' Manchester City have made this place a fortress over the years . Not many teams come away with three points so we are delighted with the way we went about it and we are happy we closed the gap . 'Giroud surges forward past Kompany ( right ) and Fernando ( left )Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez dribbles with the ballSergio Aguero jostles with Kieran Gibbs on SundaySunday ' s win was the first time Wenger had beaten City in the league since April 2012 .The Gunners have failed to beat Chelsea in just over three years and they have only beaten Manchester United once since 2008 .Arsenal ' s ability to open up the top teams in the country has never been in doubt . Last year they scored three times at the Etihad Stadium , but on Sunday they also matched that attacking verve with solid , disciplined defending .Giroud heads past City keeper Joe Hart to make it 2 0 to ArsenalSanti Carzola celebrates with Giroud after scoring his side ' s opening goal from the penalty spotRamsey hopes Arsenal ' s defence will grow in confidence as a result of the win .' It was important to get a win away from home against a big team , ' the Welshman said .' We have always been confident coming into these games but we have been a bit too open in the past and we have paid the price for that .' On Sunday , we defended really well . We kept our team shape tight defensively and we took our chances when we needed to .' We have shown what we are capable of doing . We are going to have chances in games .' We are a team that can always create opportunities to score so the important thing is to defend as a team and stop them from scoring because we are always going to get opportunities to score .' So if we can keep a clean sheet like we did yesterday , we are always going to have a chance to win . 'Sanchez sets off on a mazy run through City ' s defenceSurprisingly , no one personified that defensive solidity more than Francis Coquelin , who kept City star David Silva in check all match .Coquelin has made only 13 Premier League starts in his Arsenal career and just last month he was on loan at Sky Bet Championship side Charlton .But Ramsey thinks Coquelin is now starting to show why Wenger recruited him as a 17 year old .Francis Coquelin was able to keep Manchester City playmaker David Silva quiet' He ' s at that age now where he understands the game a lot more and he has done really well in the last few weeks , ' Ramsey said of the 23 year old , who has also had loan spells at Lorient and Freiburg .' It ' s funny how quickly things can change in football .' One week he was on loan at Charlton and then he comes back in and he has been in the team every week . He has done a very good job defensively for the team .' He wins it back , keeps it simple and just keeps things ticking over .' Hopefully he can build on his performances that he has been showing of late and he has got every chance of turning into a top defensive midfielder .

The accomplished physician humbly accepted medicine ' s highest honor before a crowd of her peers , and spoke about the importance of regular screenings to prevent unnecessary complications up inside one ' s business ." Recent advancements have brought us closer than ever to eliminating this threat , but early detection is still our best defense , " said Dr Lazoff , who earned a doctorate in lady parts from Johns Hopkins University . " I thank you all for this great honor , which I hope will finally bring the world ' s attention to the serious matter of hoo ha disease . "Attendees said Lazoff then presented a number of slides pertaining to the , uh , nether type zone .This marks the first time in more than 20 years that a Nobel Prize has been given to a physician who specializes in all that stuff downstairs . Committee members praised Lazoff for helping to stem the frightening epidemic , which last year killed more women than ta ta and derriere cancer combined .In many cases , Lazoff ' s methods have been able to prevent the spread of malignant cells from the inside of the um , geez , to the more inside of . . . you know , the part that ' s sort of , uh . God , is it getting hot in here ?During the remarkably noninvasive procedure , targeted blasts of radiation are delivered to the , err , naughty region through a special , well , wand like device that is ahem inserted near the , ho boy , " affected area . "You get the picture .The treatment was also found to eliminate fibrous growths without causing nerve damage to the surrounding bits , the inside stuff , and that other thing that looks kind of like a rubber hoop . For these reasons , Lazoff ' s work has been heralded by many in her field as " invaluable " to modern medicine ." Dr Lazoff is a brilliant and dedicated physician who has saved countless lives with her research , and I can think of no one more deserving of this award , " said noted pediatric oncologist Dr Harold Brimson . " How many do you think she sees in a day ? Must be a ton . "Accompanying the Nobel Prize is a 1 . 4 million grant that , according to medical experts , can buy Lazoff a lot of those metal spreader thingies . But the talented physician told reporters she is not interested in monetary reward , and only hopes to educate at risk women about their own vag genit about their health ." We should be encouraging an open dialogue with our young women , one that isn ' t constrained by some outdated facade of 1950s morality , " Lazoff said to a crowd of people looking down at their shoes . " I cannot say this clearly enough : Ladies , please , make an appointment to get your annual looksie doo , especially if you are seeing a fella or have experienced pain or sensitivity in your ' Hello , my baby ! Hello , my darling ! Hello , my ragtime gal ! ' . "Added Lazoff , " It is time for this country to begin having a frank discussion about the sound of loud , extended train whistle . " 	 1
DAYTON , OH Ross Hudek , a 36 year old claims processor at Northcentral Insurance in Dayton , still hasn ' t told co workers about " Zanzibar , " his three month old Billy Joel fanpage ." I really haven ' t brought it up to the gang at work , " Hudek said of the site , which features Billy Joel FAQs , photos and song lyrics , as well as links to other webpages devoted to the popular , Long Island born singer . " I ' m not hiding it or anything it ' s right out there for the world to see but I ' d just feel kind of weird if I knew people at Northcentral were looking at it . "Hudek , who lists " Captain Jack , " " Scenes From An Italian Restaurant " and " Summer , Highland Falls , " as his all time favorite Joel songs , said he is " pretty sure " that none of his co workers have ever visited the fanpage ." Claims adjustor Glenn Dietz and I talk about Billy Joel every once in awhile , because he ' s also a fan , " Hudek said . " He saw him on the Storm Front tour when he came through Cleveland in ' 89 , and I was at the same show . But I don ' t think he knows about the site . At least , he ' s never mentioned it to me . "Hudek said he spends approximately 10 hours a week on maintenance and upkeep of the website , typing in trivia questions , scanning photographs he took at various Joel concerts , and posting the results of weekly fan polls ." This week ' s question is : What is your favorite song on Turnstiles ? " Hudek said . " Surprisingly , ' Miami 2017 ' is in the lead , with seven votes . I was sure it would be ' James ' or , at the very least , ' I ' ve Loved These Days . ' Not that ' 2017 ' isn ' t a great song it is . But the best on all of Turnstiles ? My suspicion is that there ' s one person out there who really likes it and is casting multiple votes . Right now , there ' s nothing to prevent that . "" I ' m pretty proud of what I ' ve done , " Hudek continued . " There ' s a lot of good stuff there : updates on what Billy ' s been up to lately , midi files , desktop images , and a whole bunch of other downloadable goodies . Still , I ' d kind of rather keep it to myself for now . "Despite his reluctance to tell co workers , Hudek said he has a good relationship with them . Furthermore , he insists he is not " hiding " the website and would tell his fellow Northcentral employees about it if it ever were to come up in conversation ." They ' re good people , " Hudek said . " Dave Boniol and Bill Kerkseich and Samantha Deele , in particular , I would consider more than just co workers , and actually friends . But still , there ' s a limit to what we talk about . Some things are more personal , you know ? "Hudek ' s co workers may not have visited Zanzibar , but the fansite is not going unseen . Since its launch , it has received more than 200 visitors , and Hudek has received a great deal of positive e mail from other Joel fans . He has even developed an ongoing " Billy Joel trivia exchange " with some of them ." We e mail back and forth and try to stump each other , " Hudek said . " It ' s a lot of fun . I ' m pretty tough to stump , though . You can ' t just ask me something easy like , ' What was the inspiration for " Big Shot " ? ' or , ' Who is the " Famous Violinist Incognito " who plays on " The Downeaster Alexa " ? ' Or even , ' Who is the Rosalinda in " Rosalinda ' s Eyes " ? ' "Added Hudek : " A very bad date with Bianca Jagger Itzhak Perlman and Billy ' s mom . "Hudek said he decided to set up the fanpage after visiting a number of other Joel sites and finding them to be " big on graphics but sorely lacking in accurate , detailed information . "" If you ' re going to have a site devoted to the life and music of Billy Joel , you don ' t start your discography with Cold Spring Harbor , " Hudek said . " You go all the way back to his pre solo years with The Hassles . "" Not that I ' m , like , a fanatic about him , or anything , " Hudek added . " I love his music , but it ' s not the only thing I do . And I certainly wouldn ' t want to give my co workers that impression . " 	 1
RICHMOND , VA Executives at Philip Morris USA this week unveiled Marlboro Earth , a new eco friendly cigarette that gradually eliminates the causes of global warming and environmental destruction at their source ." By killing off the No . 1 threat to the environment , new Marlboro Earths will have a long term effect on the overall health of our planet , " Philip Morris spokesperson Janet Weiss said . " If everyone in America does their part and joins our new green smoking movement , then together we can eradicate man ' s destructive practices once and for all . "According to a press release from Philip Morris , the new environmentally friendly cigarettes work by employing powerful carcinogens that accumulate in the lungs of smokers , slowly breaking down their vital organs and eliminating the danger posed to the overpopulated planet by the human race .Because Marlboro Earths take decades to work , the company stresses that people should start using them as early as possible , ideally during childhood or adolescence , in order to maximize the product ' s effectiveness ." We ' ve got to get everybody on board , the sooner the better , " said Weiss , stressing that nothing less than the fate of the planet was at stake . " It doesn ' t take much . As few as two packs of Marlboro Earths a day can make all the difference in the world . "" Go ahead , " Weiss continued . " Light up , breathe in , and help save Mother Earth . "Although industry research indicates people do offer some secondary benefits to the planet , such as recycling programs and wind power generators , studies have concluded these efforts fail to offset the disastrous potential of humanity .According to Philip Morris , Marlboro Earths are the first green product to address that threat head on ." Wildlife habitat encroachment , climate change , the exploitation of precious natural resources they can all become a thing of the past , " said James Freedman , a member of the marketing team tasked with branding the new product . " Smoke these cool , clean Marlboro Earths every chance you get , and you ' ll reduce your carbon footprint to zero in no time . "Added Freedman , " Plus , you ' ll look really sophisticated and glamorous while doing it . "The new cigarettes , released in limited test market cities over the past two months , will be ready for a national rollout in mid June . An ad campaign with the slogan " Marlboro Earth : Saving the Environment One Customer at a Time " has already been launched , and the product ' s iconic new packaging , which is similar to the traditional Marlboro design but also features a tree , is reportedly testing " through the roof " with consumers .In initial product trials , the eco cigarettes have proven popular among smokers ." I leave work three to five times a day to stand outside and help the environment , " said longtime smoker Sam Davies , an office worker in Raleigh , NC . " And the best thing about them is they make saving the planet incredibly addictive . After only a few hours , I get the uncontrollable urge to go out and help the environment some more . "Philip Morris executives stressed that the new cigarettes , which contain the same great taste smokers have come to expect from Marlboro , but with nearly three times the tar and carbon monoxide , could make a huge difference in as little as 40 to 50 years , cutting down on urban sprawl , overpopulation , and eventually helping to enrich the soil with powerful fertilizers . 	 1

He was 67 .Kelly worked as a martial arts instructor in Los Angeles when he was tapped for his first role in the action movie , " Melinda . " But he is best known for his work in the 1973 Bruce Lee film " Enter the Dragon .

And he capitalized on the attention by taking on the title role in " Black Belt Jones " the following year . A spate of other roles followed throughout the 70s , most notably " Three the Hard Way , " but then dried up .In later years Kelly took up tennis professionally , becoming a ranked player on the USTA senior circuit ." I never left the movie business , " Kelly told The Los Angeles Times in 2010 , when a retrospective DVD set of his movies came out .

"But he was never far from the screen or the spotlight .In 2004 , he starred with basketball star Lebron James in a Nike commercial that spoofed another Bruce Lee film , " Game of Death . " And he sometimes appeared at comic book conventions , much to the delight of his lasting fans ."

Russian separatists in Ukraine , eager to show the world just how diplomatic and democratic they are in their newly taken over territory , smashed voting tables , threatened vote takers and surrounded the home of a man vocally in support of elections in eastern Ukraine . The nation of Ukraine was going to exercise its first free vote for a new President after ousting Yanukovych in February , an act of freedom not recognized by the ' freedom loving ' insurgents in the border lying states of the same country , even while they are demanding their ' freedom ' to rejoin a nation that specializes in squashing such sentiments .Determined to drag chunks of Europe back to the Stalinist days of the Russian Empire , Russian descent citizens of eastern Ukraine have decided that they should have the freedom to go back to a stumbling behemoth who for decades kept various eastern European nations captive under the Soviet flag . Russia , essentially a giant form of fungus only able to survive by leaching off its own masses and taking over other countries that have healthier economies , has long been suspected of sending in covert forces Al Queda style to upset and take over the citizenry of its western neighbor .Of course , there are official apologists for this development . Here we have a Mr Rashnikov Twoface explaining why things are still good :" We Russians have much to offer our traditional comrade . We can provide the wonders ofRussian culture vodka , famous plays written at a time when our country still had some artistic freedom ( 1800 ' s ) , literature written by oppressed authors who the Premiers and Czars kept under their thumb , advisers for the new lands who will make sure everyone is properly indoctrinated in our way of doing things , lots of cabbage and , of course , endless amounts of military equipment to keep those evil western leaning Ukrainians at bay and off our new land . Oh , I forgotten to mention lots and lots of Kalashnikovs . "Mr Putin , Herr Vlad himself , had this to say : " International peoples , lend me your ears ! In no way am I or my countrymen involved in this revolution going on in eastern Ukraine ! It is a natural thing when people are oppressed by one country and would rather get oppressed by another , bigger country . These peoples in eastern Ukraine are Russian speaking people who want to be rejoined with the motherland after having moved here decades ago and taken this land away from the Ukraine people . Now we want to do it again . It is now our land and we want to be free to do with it as we wish . And we want to do with Ukraine peoples land in this area as we want . "" Other countries must remember that in 1930 ' s Stalin made famine here so many Ukrainian people die and land is not used . So we moved in Russian people to use land . That is good , no ? Not good to have land not being used , especially if it can be used to feed people in Russia where everything so controlled that we not make enough food ." So this revolution is good . Russian people in Ukraine must be free to be a cog in the wheel of greater Russia . It is not good like revolution in Kiev that kicks out my good buddy Yanukovych and now I have to babysit him . That revolution bad scare me to think they maybe take away our navy base in Crimea . "" Now all is better . When all countries in eastern bloc again part of Greater Russia , then even better ! " 	 1

Buckingham Palace are today said to be furious over revelations that Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother actually died in 1997 .It has been widely speculated that public appearances for a number of years now have been carried out by an ' animatronic ' version of the nations favourite grandmother but today ' s revelation is the first concrete proof .The news came yesterday evening from a spokesperson from Adam Twoswords , the world famous waxworks exhibitors in London ." Since September 11th we have suffered from seriously depleted numbers of American tourists . This coupled with the rising costs associated with running a world class waxworks museum meant that we could simply not justify the costs involved with running the Queen Mum . After February ' s ' re dipping ' we decided we had to pull the plug , and the Palace were made aware . " , the spokesperson said .The Royal Family , themselves suffering from decreased popularity , took the decision not to fund the scheme themselves and so plans were drawn up for a ' natural death ' .A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has stated that the original intention was for the public to never know that the Queen Mum had been replaced by a waxwork robot , and that the statement from Twoswords was regrettable .Prince Philip is said to be ' a little ticked off ' , but had apparently advised against the idea 5 years ago .The Queen ' s ideaIt is understood that the idea to create an animatronix waxwork ' Lizzy ' came from the Queen herself . Said to have fealt that the nation was not ready for the death of her mother , she hatched the plan in private as early as 1992 .Prince Philip is said to have considered the idea ' sick ' , but went along with it when the Queen pointed out ' Look Philip , I ' m the Queen . Deal with it , OK ? ' .It is believed at this point that no other royals knew of the plan , but Prince Charles found out later when he discovered a number of 12v car batteries stored in The Queen Mum ' s residence . She did not drive .The animatronic version of the Queen Mum made her first public appearance at the funeral of Diana in 1997 just a couple of weeks after the real Queen Mum actually died . It was fealt that as the attention would be more on Charles at this time , and that the publics view would be ' blurred by the tears of mourning ' , it would be a good test to see if the waxwork could pull it off .None of the royals in attendance at Diana ' s funeral noticed that the Queen Mum was any different .ControversyRoyal scrutineers are now beginnning to ask legal questions given the revelations . The Queen Mum was known to be a heavy gambler , but animatronic waxworks are not legally allowed to place bets under UK law . Questions are being asked about whether bets placed between 1997 and the Easter weekend by the Queen Mum were actually legal or not .Ladbrokes are considering nullifying all bets made since 1997 and reclaiming costs .There is also the question of Royal funding by the tax payer . The royals are paid on a head count basis , and some are now claiming that the Queen Mum was only kept ' alive ' in order to claim more funds from the tax payer .How it worked The Queen Mum 	 1
Facebook have been at it again , manipulating people through their ' social experiments ' , well this time , they have gone to far for one woman from Kendal ." Facebook made me transgender , " said Caroline Meechan from Kendal . " I used to be Charles Meechan from Kendal . "Early in 2014 Facebook revealed that it was manipulating what people were seeing on their timeline to determine if Social Networking sites could influence people ' s mood . They sent negative , angry content to some people , and happy , positive content to others . After a few months , they analysed the tone of the posts of the two groups and discovered that those sent mainly positive comments were now happy , content and well adjusted individuals , whilst those sent negative comments had succumbed to drug addiction , depression and suicide ." It was a very effective demonstration , " said Mark Zucherberg . " We ' re currently investigating methods of using this in advertising . "Meanwhile , this is not the only psychological experiment going on . They are also seeing if they can make straight people gay , and binary gender people trans . And it ' s worked . According to Caroline Meechan , and her wife Samanthan Meechan , Caroline had been a happily married man for twenty five years until after being manipulated by subtle content on Facebook , Charles Meechan discovered his feminine side ." It was a gradual thing , " said Samantha . " First it was the clothes , then the makeup . He came out and admitted his feelings to me a few weeks ago , just after the announcement of what Facebook have been doing . Now he wants to live his life as a woman . I ' m devastated . How could Zucherberg do this to me ? "Caroline Meechan however believes that this has turned out for the best ." I feel so liberated and wonderful since discovering I was actually born a woman in a man ' s body , " she said . " It feels ' right ' , if you know what I mean , which I ' m sure you don ' t in your rigid binary gender roles . "Mark Zucherberg has refused to be drawn on this wanton destruction of a family from Kendal , only going as far to say that Charles Meechan was never sent transgender content , and must be using Facebook as an excuse to his wife . 	 1
New York Women have long dominated the heated discussion around gender equality . But one group not engaging in the conversation is men , says Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg .What ' s more , in her new bestseller " Lean In , " Sandberg argues gender parity is impossible without them ." I think it is too hard for men to talk about gender , " says Sandberg . " We have to let men talk about this . . . because we need men to talk about this if it is ever going to change . "And with men at the helm of most large companies , engaging the other 50 of the population in the gender debate is the key to gender equality , she says ." I don ' t think men should be part of " Lean In " or part of equality because it ' s nice for women . They need to be part of it for themselves . . . as managers and as peers in the workforce this is a competitive advantage for men . "If 86 of the top jobs are held by men and they tend to be older than the women who have just joined their companies , inviting this group of decision makers to help mentor women into top roles is the logical way forward , explains Sandberg ." For every man out there , it should be a badge of honor to mentor young women . Not something you ' re ashamed to do , not something you ' re afraid someone will assume something bad , but a badge of honor that you are willing to spend your time giving the benefit of your experience to young women in the workforce . They need it . "As a female leader who has only worked for men and been mentored by men , her track record and success is proof in itself ." I ' ve never worked for a woman . Most women , if they get senior , have never worked for a woman , because again , 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men . I ' ve had great mentors and great sponsors and part of Lean In is trying to help people find the right way to develop those mentors and sponsors . "As a Harvard graduate , she was selected to join the World Bank by her former professor , Larry Summers and later went on to become his Chief of Staff at the U . S . Treasury after working at McKinsey and earning her M . B . A . In the midst of moving to Google and then Facebook , Sandberg wed and had two children , a boy and a girl .But Sandberg ' s book what she calls " a sort " of feminist manifesto hasn ' t been without critics . The Facebook executive received overwhelming reactions from female columnists at USA Today and the New York Times as well as authors specializing in gender workplace issues .One notable reaction came from Avivah Wittenberg Cox , who runs a global management consultancy , 20 first , that helps companies achieve greater gender balance .In a recent Harvard Business Review article , Cox argues Sandberg is insulting women by suggesting they need to be more like men to succeed and even suggests she ' s blaming them . " We ' ve never , in all of human history , seen a generation of brighter , better educated or more ambitious women , " she writes . " They have the keys . We just still haven ' t figured out how to adapt our organizations to optimize their talents . "But Sandberg explains her point is quite the contrary . " I ' m not telling women to be like men . I ' m telling us to evaluate what men and women do in the workforce and at home without the gender bias . "What ' s more , Sandberg has also noticed it is women , not men who ' ve been most vocal about the book .INTERACTIVE : 10 most powerful women in tech" Most of the debate about " Lean In " has been women , especially the first couple weeks before the book was out . The most surprising thing was that no man said a word . I couldn ' t find a man writing a line , not saying a word . "Sandberg isn ' t just pointing out the stalled feminist revolution she also offers a solution with Leanin . org , a not for profit foundation that will help spur change by offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals .Funded by her book and corporate sponsors , the foundation will allow professional women to review social science research , share stories and receive online training and practical advice on career development to help women " take a seat at the table " ." Lean In is not about fixing women . And it ' s certainly not about any one person doing this on their own , " she asserts . " Lean In is about all of us coming together to understand the stereotypes that are holding women back and fix them . And to start having an honest conversation about women in the workplace . " 	 0
Manchester City , Chelsea , Manchester United and Arsenal will all have to rethink their summer recruitment plans after Marco Reus confirmed that he has signed a new contract with relegation threatened Borussia Dortmund until 2019 .Reus ' new deal is understood to be worth 6million a year plus 1 . 5m a year in image rights equating to around 145 , 000 a week .It is an extraordinary step of faith by Reus to commit to Dortmund , who are 16th in Bundlesliga , in danger of relegation and with no prospect of qualifying for the Champions League next season , except in the highly unlikely event that they were to win the trophy this season .Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus has signed a new four year contract with the clubReus poses with Dortmund ' s director of football Michael Zorc ( left ) and chairman Hans Joachim WatzkeEven more remarkably the deal does not contain a specific release clause an outstanding piece of negotiation by Dortmund managing director Michael Zorc , given that Reus had a 20m release clause in his former contract which could be activated this summer .' I am happy to have extended the contract , ' Reus said in a club video interview . ' When I came here ( in 2012 ) I said I wanted to do things . I have the feeling that it ' s not over even in this situation . '' We fall together and we win together , It is a decision for life . I did not think about it that long for no reason . 'In a statement to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange , the club confirmed that the 20m release clause had been removed and that there were now no further release clauses in the deal .The 25 year old Dortmund born midfielder , widely considered one of the best in the world , would have been available for a bargain fee , with Dortmund missing out on cashing in on one of their biggest assets had the clause remained .Marco Reus scored in 3 0 victory at Freiburg which lifted Borussia Dortmund off the bottom of the tableNow they can expect to receive at least 50m for Reus and the prospect of at least another season from him .Despite a clamour of interest from the leading English clubs , with United and City leading the chase , Reus ' next move has always been more likely to Spain , with Real Madrid having been the club expected to sign him this summer .Reus , however , is understood to have been keener on a move to Barcelona but that prospect was scuppered by FIFA ' s transfer ban on the Catalan club , meaning they cannot sign new players until 2016 for breaching rules in recruiting young overseas players .Signing a new deal at Dortmund means that he is immediately elevated into the realms of one of the elite world footballers in terms of wages and can now wait 18 months to join Barcelona , where his friend Marc Andre ter Stegen is the reserve team goalkeeperWhatever the plans for the future , for now Dortmund are celebrating their coup in persuading Reus , who was a Dortmund fan as a boy , to stay .Jurgen Klopp wants to build new Dortmund team around German midfielder Reus' We never let ourselves be influenced by all the transfer rumours and we always saw a good chance that this exceptional player could consciously decide in favour of Dortmund , ' said Hans Joachim Watzke , chief executive at Dortmund .' Marco can become an iconic player at Dortmund , like Uwe Sweeler was at Hamburg or Steven Gerrard at Liverpool . '' The fact that he is has chose to lengthen his deal here at a time of crisis on the pitch shows how strongly he identifies with the club is and we ' re very proud of that . 'Zorc said : ' Marco could have chosen any top club in the world . The fact that he has taken this decision shown that is heart is with his home town and his home club .' For Dortmund , who lost centre forward Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich last summer on a free transfer after they failed to lengthen his deal and also lost Mario Goetze to Bayern , who activated his 30m buy out clause in 2013 , the Reus deal represents the highlight thus far or a dreadful season on the pitch . 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC Preparing for another possible showdown with Iraq , President Clinton deployed more than 15 , 000 very special U . S . forces to the Persian Gulf region Tuesday .Clinton said the objective of the mission , dubbed Operation Great Job ! , is twofold : to keep pressure on Saddam Hussein to permit the return of U . N . weapons inspectors , and to provide America ' s very special forces with a positive , rewarding , esteem building experience ." With Operation Great Job ! , we send the message loud and clear to Saddam Hussein that his open defiance of the United Nations and international law will not be tolerated , " Clinton said . " We also send the equally important message to our own troops that what ' s important is not whether you defeat the enemy , but that you try your best and have fun . "Added Clinton : " Hooray , U . S . troops ! "At a Pentagon press conference , Secretary of Defense William Cohen expressed confidence that the mission will be successful . " I have full faith that our troops will do a terrific job in Iraq , " Cohen said , " but even if they make a few mistakes , we ' ll still be very , very proud of them . "Cohen stressed that the safety of America ' s special forces is of paramount importance . In an effort to reduce the risk of anyone getting hurt , the Defense Secretary has urged all U . S . troops to tie their shoelaces " nice and tight . "" Whenever you ' re in a combat situation , there is almost always going to be some running involved , " Cohen said , " And the last thing we want is for any of our soldiers to trip and fall . "Morale is said to be high among members of the very special forces , who were flown Monday from Sheppard Air Force Base to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , in a squadron of specially modified C 130 " short planes . " Upon arriving , the troops were given a thorough mission debriefing by Gen . James Herzog and a butterscotch pudding snack cup . Each soldier was then issued an AR 15 rifle , three clips of NATO 7 . 62 mm rounds , a combat helmet with a velcro safety strap , and a fanny pack with his name written on it in black magic marker ." We are going to win the war , " said Pvt . Richie Ammaker of Hagerstown , MD , eating his snack cup with a Capri Sun juice pak . " I love to clap and sing along to the music ! "" Colonel Gene Diering says that if we take out the communications tower in Al Basrah , we can have a pizza party , " Pvt . Josh Paretsky of Dallas said . " Pizza party ! Pizza party ! Pizza party ! "" You ' re pretty , " Paretsky added . " Will you marry me ? "Gen . Thomas Merritt , who is in charge of overseeing Operation Great Job ! , said the troops are thoroughly prepared for what lies ahead ." We have gone over maneuvers and protocol in detail , and we have all marked down our special targets in our special notebooks , " Merritt said . " The soldiers know they are not to wander off from the group . They know they are to use inside voices when in enemy territory . And they know they are to go to the bathroom prior to all ground assaults . This group is ready . "Merritt went on to note that , despite the very special nature of the mission , strict military discipline will be maintained , including mandatory quiet room " time outs " for any soldiers who begin " acting out " or displaying inappropriate behavior in combat situations .According to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , the length of the mission depends upon the performance of the troops . " Hopefully , all will go well , and our very special forces will be back home within a week , " Albright said . " But if there are setbacks , such as soldiers losing their keys or having trouble staying on task or forgetting to take their pills , it could take longer . "Regardless of the outcome on the field of battle , Albright said America ' s fighting forces will emerge as " big winners . "" These soldiers will have the chance to strike a blow for global democracy and make lots of new friends in the process , so how can they not win ? " asked Albright , who noted that every soldier who participates in Operation Great Job ! will receive a shiny medal . " This is truly going to be a very special invasion . " 	 1
An anti drink driving group put out a glowing report of Uber after receiving a sizable donation from the taxi app , it has been revealed .Last week Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) and Uber jointly published the study which suggested the ride sharing service had helped reduce the number of drink driving accidents .The press release stated that Uber can be ' a powerful tool in the fight to reduce the number of drunk driving crashes ' and found ridesharing is having a ' significant impact ' on drink driving across America ' s cities .Mothers Against Drunk Driving put out a glowing report of Uber after receiving a sizable donation from the taxi appMeanwhile , it has since been revealed that Uber started donating money to MADD last summer .Last year Uber and MADD announced a partnership in which the app would donate 1 for every ride taken and 10 for every new customer who used the service in a 24 hour period around the 4th of July , as long as customers used a promo code , UberMADD .Last weekend , Uber ran a similar deal on Super Bowl Sunday , where the service donated 1 for every passenger between 3pm and midnight who used the code ThinkandRide .Amy George , senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD , said they were not backing away from the reportIt is not yet clear how much money has been passed to MADD .After the report came under scrutiny , Amy George , senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD , said that the figures in the report that appeared to show a drop in drink driving in cities where Uber was used was purely correlational .' Nobody is saying that there is a causation relationship here , ' she told Pro Publica .Ms George denied distancing herself from the study and said the anti drink driving organisation would continue to back its findings .' MADD strongly stands behind the report and that Uber is a powerful tool to reduce drunk driving , ' she told Valley Wag . ' We have consistently said the data is correlative , and those correlations are valid at showing that Uber is having an impact . 'In the report , Uber claimed that ' when empowered with more transportation options , people are making safer , better choices that are helping save lives . 'Among the findings , the research found that drunk driving crashes in California fell by 6 . 5 per cent among drivers under 30 in the markets where Uber operates an estimated total of 1 , 800 crashes prevented since July 2012 .With California the app ' s home state , the company claims that the drop demonstrates for a possible similar reduction in other Uber markets .It appears that the Uber taxi app service had started donating money to MADD last summer 	 0
Philadelphia Police Investigate Extremist Connections In Officer AmbushUpdated January 8 , 20167 : 57 PM ET Published January 8 , 20164 : 31 PM ETA Philadelphia man is in custody after allegedly ambushing a city police officer in his squad car . The officer is recovering from the attack . The man told police he shot the officer in the name of Islam and ISIS . Philadelphia ' s police commissioner says the city is looking for connections between the shooter and extremist groups . The man has a criminal record and the commissioner referred to him as appearing deranged .In Philadelphia , the police commissioner says it ' s a miracle that an officer survived an attack last night . The officer was shot in his squad car last night . And the suspect , Edward Archer , was taken into custody immediately after the incident . This is being investigated as a possible terrorist attack . Reporter Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY joins us with more . And , Bobby , what did police say about how this unfolded ?BOBBY ALLYN , BYLINE : So surveillance footage depicts the officer , Jesse Hartnett , driving in west Philadelphia in his squad car around 11 : 40 last night when a suspect started shooting . The shooter ' s been identified as Edward Archer . And he was wearing a white , kind of sheer robe and fired 13 times as he approached the driver side of the car . After the officer returned fire , the suspect fled and then was taken into custody shortly after . The officer was hit three times and sustained a broken arm and nerve damage in the barrage of fire but is now in stable condition .CORNISH : Why is this being investigated as a possible terrorist attack ?ALLYN : Well , right now , it ' s important to emphasize that the case is riddled with unknowns . Under questioning , Archer told investigators that he attacked in the name of Islam , but that connection shouldn ' t be overblown at this point in the investigation . Local reports are saying that his name was not immediately known to local imams . So the extent of even his religion is kind of sketchy right now . And it really speaks to a point underscored by Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney that the shooting shouldn ' t be seen as representative of Muslims or the faith of Islam . And again , no direct link to a terrorist organization has been established so far .CORNISH : Is there any more known about Archer at this point ?ALLYN : The kind of a rough sketch is slowly emerging of him . He has a criminal history , has been convicted of charges , including assault , and actually had a court date , a sentencing hearing , scheduled for this coming Monday on another incident . His mother has said that he ' s been hearing voices in his head and acting peculiar lately , but why and what ' s been going on in his life lately is still largely unknown .CORNISH : That ' s the suspect ' s mom speaking to a newspaper .CORNISH : Where does the investigation go from here ?ALLYN : Well , state and federal authorities are still kind of in the evidence gathering stage right now , so much more could emerge in the coming weeks . But charges are very likely forthcoming , though prosecutors won ' t yet elaborate on what exactly Archer might be facing .CORNISH : That ' s WHYY ' s Bobby Allyn .

New York is famous for its singular residents : Loudmouthed taxi drivers . Hirsute Brooklyn hipsters . Upper East Side patrons of the arts .Now , the city is welcoming an unlikely new breed of denizen : a newly discovered species of frog .A team of scientists has identified the unique critter , dubbed the Atlantic Coast leopard frog , in the marshes of Staten Island beside New York Harbor and not far from the Statue of Liberty .The frog ' s habitat stretches from Connecticut to North Carolina , but it ' s the discovery of an exotic animal species in one of the world ' s most densely populated urban areas that has scientists buzzing ." It is incredible and exciting that a new species of frog could be hiding in plain sight in New York City , " said Joanna Burger , a biology professor at Rutgers University and a co author of a research paper about the frog , published this week in the scientific journal PLOS One .The finding confirms research done more than 75 years ago by Carl Kauffeld , former director of the Staten Island Zoo , who wrote many books about amphibians and was considered an authority on the subject . Kauffeld published a paper in 1937 in which he claimed to have discovered the new frog species , but his research was dismissed for lack of evidence .Kauffeld died in 1974 at age 63 . His cause was taken up six years ago by Rutgers doctoral candidate Jeremy Feinberg , lead author of the new paper .Feinberg and other researchers said they were able to employ modern technology to examine the genetics and mating calls of leopard frogs and determine that the amphibians in the wetlands of Staten Island were in fact distinct from two closely related other species inhabiting the northeast U . S ." We had the benefits of genetic testing and bioacoustic analysis that simply weren ' t available to Kauffeld to prove that even though this frog might look like the two other leopard frogs in the area , it was actually a third and completely separate species , " Feinberg said .In giving the scientific name Rana kauffeldi to the new frog , Feinberg and a team of seven other researchers chose to honor Kauffeld and his work ." After some discussion , we agreed that it just seemed right to name the species after Carl Kauffeld , " Feinberg said . " We wanted to acknowledge his work and give credit where we believe it was due , even though it was nearly 80 years after the fact . "Despite its trademark urban canyons of steel , glass and concrete , New York actually is home to a wide variety of animal life . The 843 acres of Central Park , for example , contain raccoons and opossums , many types of migratory birds and a rare species of centipede . And , of course , lots and lots of pigeons .No word on whether the Staten Island frog ever swims across the harbor to Manhattan for a little sightseeing . But given the public fascination with the Bronx Zoo cobra that briefly escaped its enclosure in 2011 , it may be only a matter of time before the new frog gets its own Twitter account . 	 0
A spokesperson for SpongeBob Squarepants said on Wednesday that the undersea sensation will be using the Atkins Diet to lose some unwanted pounds , in order to broaden his acting horizons . " Sponge Bob does not want to be typecast . He wants to have the flexibilty of any other Hollywood star . "SpongeBob is vying for several other roles , including a part in the final Star Wars epic film , as well as the host of a new TV reality series . SpongeBob Squarepants is also planning to do a name change after he loses the weight . He does not want to continue only in his current direction . He is contemplating several different titles , such as " SpongeBob , formerly known as Squarepants , " and " Bob the Body Builder . "His co star in the hit kids ' TV and film series , Patrick the Starfish is not commenting on SpongeBob ' s new found direction . Patrick believes that SpongeBob ' s recent behavior has been caused by ascending too quickly from the depths of the sea , causing him to get a mild case of decompression sickness , otherwise known as the bends .Spokesmen for the hit children ' s show are not commenting on SpongeBob ' s newfound interest in feature films and reality TV . There has been talk , however , of a spin off show centered around the adventures of Patrick the Starfish . No official word has been documented .Squarepants has been supporting his new dieting habit through exercise at the local YSCA ( Young Sponge Community Athletics ) . He has been running , rowing , and doing weight training with personal trainer Iam Pumpinup . Iam told the press on Wednesday that " Squarepants is a natural runner , and he even had a cameo at the 2004 Summer Olympic Trials . He was only a . 001 of a point away from making it into the semi finals . That is pretty good for someone so , uh , square . "SpongeBob is reportedly the first cartoon character to use the popular Atkins Diet . The results have not been tested on sea sponges , and the outcome is not certain . Scooby Doo and Shaggy have noted that their diet plan , " Eat Everything That Is Not Nailed Down " has been a real hit with fellow cartoon network stars .Although , some remain skeptical , SpongeBob has some supporters : Batman , Yu gi oh , and David the Knome all praise the sponge ' s efforts to better himself and branch out in the world of on screen acting . SpongeBob will appear on the Saturday night edition of SpaceGhost Coast to Coast for a full interview concerning his recent publicity . 	 1
20th century beauty secrets : To enhance their appearance , women in 1907 were advised to cry and wear pearlsToday women have a plethora of cosmetics at their fingers tips to help their eyes appear wider and brighter .A column called ' Little Secrets of Beauty ' published in the newspaper in March 1907 advises women to have a good old cry if they want to look good as long as it ' s kept short .The article states : ' Crying will make the eyes brighter provided it is not indulged in for too long . A brisk little cry clears out the tear ducts and makes the eyes clearer , but much of it will take away the brilliancy again . 'In another surprising tip , they warn : ' The woman facing a bright light while she sews or reads will soon have her eyes of no colour at all . 'The column has other advice for women dependent on their hair and eye colour .For women with brown eyes , it ' s recommended they wear ' brown round her neck and under her chin ' to enhance the colour .It adds : ' The brown eyed woman should dress her hair rather fluffily . She must not wear it plain , and should bring it down well upon her forehead . 'Women with blonde hair and brown eyes are in luck as the article states they will look ' charming no matter how she arranges her hair , provided of course that is is well coiffe . It is as well for her to mass her hair high above her forehead so that it will make an aureole for her face . 'But the writer laments : ' It is the woman with dull or fishy eyes who is at a loss how to proceed because her eyes lack colour . 'Scrubbing up well : Pale eyed girls were advised to ' treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower ' and bath their eye lashes with a little boracic acid in waterFor such women , they offer the following advice : ' Do not make " play " with your eyes . It is the pale eyed girl who loves to cast her eyes upwards looking at nothing at all . It is the girl with the pale blue eyes who rolls them and strikes attitudes .' But be it remembered that while the black eyed girl may attempt such " play " the pale eyed one never should do so . 'They recommend that the ' pale eyed girl should treat her eyebrows every night with a good eyebrow grower in the form of a little almond oil and vaseline mixed half and half . In the morning , the eyebrows should be brushed with a little soft bay toothbrush . 'Meanwhile , they also advise bathing eye lashes with warm water with a hint of boracic acid dissolved in it .Last resort : Pale eyed girls could always wear a hat but shouldn ' t make ' play ' with their eyes in order to look more attractiveThis eye wash is often only used in the modern day to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis but back in 1907 , it was said to keep eye lashes ' well and strong ' .If all else fails for the ' pale eyed girl ' then the 20th century beauty columnist recommends she ' wears a hat that tips forward over her face so that the brim may shade her eyes ' .When it comes to accessorising , in 1907 diamonds were not a girls ' best friend . Instead , pearls were more in fashion according to the beauty column as they are ' softer and vastly more welcoming than diamonds ' .Under a sub heading ' crimes against beauty ' the writer warns about the causes of premature ageing , some of which remain in vogue today . For example , they state that ' the woman who looks intently at things will soon develop a wrinkle between the eyes ' and sleeping with the face in the pillow can lead to ' waking up with a thousand wrinkles ' .Times may have changed but beauty writers today still advise against squinting as it can cause lines around the eyes and recommend a silk or satin pillow to prevent wrinkles . 	 0
Caribbean " A classic , Ecuador style bit of legalistic bullshit , " is how constitutional experts have described some Brit shyster lawyers ' attempts to sue the governments of the UK , France and Holland for acts of slavery committed by private individuals more than 200 years ago .Launched by a fantasy peddling bunch of London Human Frights Act crooks the action aims to squeeze billions in compensation for an aggrieved ragbag of gimme gimmes .This morning at a UN press conference announcing the move Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Monster Ralph Gonsalves said : " These bastards owe us , " in a grim echo of Ecuadorian wack job Rafael Correa ' s claims to US super major Chevron ' s billions for environmental damage wrought by the country ' s own national oil and gas corporation PetroEcuador .Gonsalves told a packed audience of just three delegates that he was speaking on behalf of 12 Caricom countries despite knowing their absurd previous slavery compensation bids were repeatedly rejected by the UN as little more than a cynical smash and grab .Fortunately so far there has been little or no interest in financing the action by the usual bleed ' em dry vulture funds who bankroll every bit of extravagant compensation under the monumentally assinine Human Frights Act .Earlier this year one such firm of litigation backers performed a massive U turn over financing the Amazonbotch organization ' s Chevron scam that will culminate next Tuesday before Manhattan District Judge Lewis Kaplan in long awaited RICO racketeering and corruption lawsuit .The London based hedge fund and its professional partners have beaten a hasty retreat from backing the litigation after reviewing evidence in which deluded pro Ecuador lawyer Steven Donziger boasted about his techniques for pulling off the Chevron fraud .Next week Donziger and his Washington DC lobbyist cheerleaders Patton Boggs are up before Judge Lewis Kaplan indicted on countless charges under the RICO racketeering and corruption act .Stay tuned to this website for all the blow by blow details in what promises to be a right old eyeopener as decades of criminality are laid bare . 	 1

BOISE , ID According to friends and family , the automobile accident that claimed the life of area youth Evan Laskin this week tragically cut short the prospects of a talented 18 year old who had aspired his whole life to be a living person .Those closest to him said Laskin would be remembered not only as a loving son and caring friend , but also as a gifted young man who , right up until the very end , showed tremendous promise when it came to being alive ." His whole life , Evan wanted nothing more than to exist , " said Bryan Dermott , a classmate and close friend of Laskin who shared his ambition to have a functioning central nervous system . " It ' s a big part of who he was . He was always talking about consuming vital nutrients , metabolizing them , producing new cells to replace old or damaged ones , breathing . Living was the thing that was most important to him , and he was really good at it , too . "" He was alive practically all the time , " Dermott continued . " In fact , when I last talked to him , I specifically remember him being alive . "Many people who knew him well confirmed Laskin lived almost every single day , sometimes for hours at a time , and said continuing his life was something he talked about constantly . Sources recalled how the high school senior would light up when the subject turned to living , but would often drift off or appear to grow distant at the mention of dying , something he never showed much interest in .Growing up in a family of living people his father Maurice was an auto mechanic who lived whenever he could , while his mother Paula also took great pride in being a self sustaining assemblage of organic molecules Laskin reportedly displayed a proclivity and passion for existence from a very young age ." Often I ' d wake up at six in the morning and Evan would already be downstairs moving around , thinking about things , experiencing continuous reality , and responding to external stimuli , " said Paula Laskin , adding that her son had covered the walls of his bedroom with posters of living people he idolized . " Even as a toddler , he talked about how much he wanted to be alive , to have functioning organs and measurable brain activity . You could tell just by being around him that Evan ' s calling in life was to be a living human being . "Laskin ' s father told reporters he believed his boy could have grown up to be very successful at existing ." I guess that ' s how I ' ll always remember him as an alive person , " Laskin ' s father said . " I ' ll never forget when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up , whether it was a living person or a dead person . Well , he cut me off right there and told me he wanted to be alive . I was so very , very proud of him at that moment . "" I like to think that Evan was alive right up until the moment he died , " he continued through tears . " That ' s just the kind of person he was . "Students and faculty at Laskin ' s school said they planned to honor the teen ' s memory with a prolonged moment of life tomorrow morning . 	 1
It has been announced that a panel of judges are awaiting nominations for " The most innocent person on earth " . The winner is going to be announced at a gala function , to be held on the 1st of April 2009 , that will rival the Oscar ceremonies .To date there are five nominees , the first being ex President of the United states , Bill Clinton .Although he could not strictly be said to be completely innocent since he has been caught out on a whopper or two , the argument goes that there are so many things that he has done that have not attracted attention , and therefore did not have to tell whoppers about it , that he might just about qualify to be the most innocent person on earth .President Bush ' s nomination has been cancelled , on the grounds that he is not responsible for what he is saying and that his script writer should rather be nominated . It was then decided to sift through Pres . Bush ' s prepared scripts to find the writer who was responsible for the President ' s speech where he stated that there were definitely Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq , because that would surely make him the most innocent person who never caused a war .Clarence Mitchell ' s nomination was accepted because , although he spoke on behalf of the innocent Drr McCann , he is completely innocent of ever bending the truth on their behalf . The Drr McCann were of course also nominated , but the panel could not decide which of them is the most innocent , and are still debating if one or both of them should go through to the final nominations .Dr Mugabe looks like the front runner for the prize at the moment , because anybody who is innocent of causing that much suffering to a whole nation is surely the most innocent person on earth . The last of the five nominations is for a certain Mafia boss who has warned that his name must never be mentioned even though HE is the most innocent person on earth .Please send in your nominations for this memorable prize , there is still time , and the person you have nominated might just walk away with this greatest prize on earth . 	 1

baghdad, iraq three people were killed when a parked car rigged with explosives blew up saturday in najaf on the eve of parliamentary elections, the interior ministry said. at least 54 others 17 iraqis and 37 iranians were injured in the attack near the imam ali holy shrine, which houses the tomb of ali, cousin of the prophet mohammed. two of the dead were iranians, the interior official said. najaf, about 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) south of baghdad, is frequented by shiite pilgrims from iran. iraqis will go to the polls sunday to choose a 325 member parliament. the election has been marred by violence despite heavy security. it is iraq's fifth nationwide vote since 2003, but only the second for a full four year term parliament. three attacks happened thursday during early voting for those who will be unable to cast ballots sunday, such as military and security personnel, detainees, hospital staff, and patients. a total of 12 people were killed and dozens were wounded. there have been warnings of further insurgent attacks around the vote. these are iraq's first national elections since 2005, when the sunni arab population boycotted the elections and the political process. a shiite led government emerged and the sunnis, feeling disenfranchised, went on to form the main part of the insurgency. the united nations assistance mission for iraq calls the elections an " important milestone in iraq's democratic progress, " serving to strengthen the country's sovereignty and independence as the united states draws down its military presence there. sunday's elections were supposed to happen in january but were delayed because of political disagreements and a delay in passing the election law that paved the way for this vote. there are 18. 9 million eligible voters, casting ballots for 325 seats in the council of representatives, as iraq's parliament is called. the seats represent iraq's 18 provinces. at least a quarter of the positions 82 are guaranteed to go to women, and eight more have been allocated for minorities. they include five set aside for christians and one each for the shabak, sabaeans ( mandaeans ), and yazidis. the number of seats is increasing from the previous 275. seat allocation was based on 2005 population data from the ministry of trade and adjusted for a 2. 8 percent annual growth across all governates. voting for iraqis abroad also is happening in 16 countries starting friday including the united states, united kingdom, turkey, iran, canada and others in the middle east and europe. there are no exact figures for those eligible to cast ballots abroad. estimates on turnout have ranged anywhere from 300, 000 to 3 million. around 6, 200 candidates from more than 80 political entities are vying for seats. it is the first parliamentary vote to use an open list, in which the voters vote for political entities and, if they want, also can vote for candidates within those entities, according to the u. n. assistance mission. although open lists complicates the training of election staff and the counting of votes, the system enhances the role of the voter in the election beyond casting a vote simply for a political party, the assistance mission says. at least 25 percent of the candidates on the ballot list of each political entity must be women. the assistance mission is providing technical assistance to the independent high electoral commission, which is organizing the vote. the commission has ordered that all political campaigning must end as of 7 a. m. saturday. a number of other special measures are being put in place for security reasons. since monday, there has been a ban on motorcycles and bicycles in baghdad until further notice, and on sunday a two day ban on any vehicles in cities will begin, iraqi authorities announced on state television. provincial borders will be sealed, preventing movements between provinces, from saturday to monday. and international borders and all airports will be shut from midnight saturday. a curfew will be in place in cities from midnight to 5 a. m. on saturday, sunday and monday, officials said. civilians may not carry weapons on those days, they said. more than 47, 000 polling stations will be open across the country, each one able to accept a maximum number of 420 voters. polling stations are clustered into polling centers. polls will be open from 7 a. m. to 5 p. m. all those in line at the time the polls are open will be able to vote. about 300, 000 trained election staff mostly teachers, principals, and lawyers will be on hand at polling sites. there will be more than 494, 000 local and international observers, according to the independent high electoral commission. the number includes about 500 to 600 international observers, according to the united nations. voter turnout figures should be available shortly after polls close, and preliminary results are expected by tuesday or wednesday, the united nations said. results will start emerging for each province as soon as 30 percent of polling centers in that province are tallied. 	 0
Turkey ' s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing a local election this weekend , the biggest test of his popularity since becoming Prime Minister in 2003 . The polls are seen as a referendum on his popularity before the country ' s first direct presidential election this summer , in which Erdogan is widely expected to run .But things don ' t seem to be going smoothly . Just months after the damaging Gezi Park protests in Istanbul , Erdogan ' s government is now facing a wide ranging anti corruption probe .And to add to the misery , Turkey ' s economy , once hailed as a miracle , is slowing down , its currency is hovering around record lows against the dollar , and some of its firms are facing huge foreign debts .How did it get into this mess ?Many developed countries struggled with growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis . Not so Turkey , which grew substantially over the last decade . Erdogan ' s government was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China .The rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country . As the crisis hit developed economies , investors turned to emerging markets which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets .For years , Turkey had enjoyed a foreign funded construction boom . House prices had soared more than 50 since the end of 2009 and both the country ' s GDP and per capita income had increased threefold since 2003 .But the party ended with the U . S . Federal Reserve announcing a scale back in its stimulus program last summer . Suddenly , there was less cash available to invest .With more security in the U . S . economy , investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets .Turkey ' s growth slowed to just above 2 and inflation rose to 7 . 4 in 2013 , well above the 5 target . The country ' s currency , the Lira , slumped further in January , which forced Turkey ' s central bank to adopt a radical approach and almost double interest rates from 7 . 7 to 12 a clear indication of the bank ' s determination to prevent foreign capital outflows .But for voters , this may not be good news . Higher interest rates are likely to slow down Turkey ' s economic growth . And as cash becomes less available and borrowing becomes more expensive , producers and business owners are likely to pass their increased costs to consumers , who will in turn see prices going up .Erdogan is aware of this and strongly opposed the bank ' s move to raise interest rates . He argued it would hurt Turkey ' s growth and blamed the Lira ' s recent tumble on the opposition and an " interest rates lobby , " saying it was the result of a conspiracy against him and his government .And while Turkey ' s 800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world , the IMF has warned it is not built on a sustainable model and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders .Add to this another grim statistic : the country ' s poverty . According to the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development ( OECD ) , one in five Turks live below the relative poverty line meaning their income is less than half of the country ' s median . That is one of the highest figures among developed countries , with only Mexico and Israel lagging behind .Turkey ' s strategic position means the country is the bridge between Asia and Europe . Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance .But the current unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions its stock market lost a third of its value last year alone . Foreign investors have been watching Erdogan ' s steps closely and to them , the result of this weekend ' s local election could be an indication of where the country ' s economy moves next .Read more : Turkey ' s political crisis undermining democracyRead more : Is instability the ' new normal ' for Turkey ?Turkey : From a bridge to an island in the MideastRead more : Worst is yet to come for Fragile Five 	 0
Jose Mourinho has criticised the tactical ineffectiveness of Roy Hodgson and Vicente Del Bosque at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil .Hodgson ' s England and Del Bosque ' s Spain both crashed out in the group stages , and Mourinho admitted that he could not understand the manager ' s decisions when losing matches .Speaking to Alastair Campbell for his new book ' Winners : And How They Succeed ' , the Chelsea boss said of England :Roy Hodgson looks on , hands on hips , as England struggle at the Brazil World Cup in June 2014Luis Suarez scored twice for Uruguay to resign England to defeat in Sao Paolo in their second Group D matchSuarez spreads his arms in celebration and Mourinho admits he would have treated the game differently' They are losing to Uruguay in their second group match and , if they lose , they are out of the tournament , so they have to score . They made two changes at 1 0 down . But when Roy Hodgson made these changes Raheem Sterling out , Ross Barkley in , then Adam Lallana in for Danny Welbeck I couldn ' t see a strategic change . Same tactical model , same system . '' You are losing 1 0 , you need to get a draw at least , so I say take one defender off and play three at the back , put an extra man to midfield attack .' So maybe take off Leighton Baines and play Gary Cahill sweeper , Glen Johnson and Phil Jagielka marking one each , an extra man to midfield or attack . Then Uruguay have to adapt . 'The Chelsea boss ( centre ) has criticised the way Hodgson didn ' t change his tactics against UruguaySome England fans felt the same as Mourinho that Hodgson hadn ' t done enough tacticallyMourinho also stuck the boot in to Vicente Del Bosque the Spain manager who also saw his side crash outMourinho ' s in depth analysis of England will haunt fans who wanted him in charge in 2007 , when he came close to accepting the role before his wife told him to turn it down ' because he ' d be bored ' .The now Chelsea manager , who has guided his team to top of the Premier League , then turned his attentions away from analysing England , instead focusing on Spain , whose World Cup exploits were equally as bad as the Three Lions if not worse .' They Spain are losing so Diego Costa out , Fernando Torres in . Why ? Play them together . You need to change . They will say , " Ah , but Spain has its own system , its own philosophy " hell , if it is not working , you change . ' 	 0

London The Duchess of Cambridge has been photographed furtively once again : An Italian magazine announced Tuesday it will publish vacation photos of the pregnant royal and her baby bump , despite her objection .The magazine , Chi , said Tuesday that it will print " extraordinary images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their dream holiday in the Caribbean " in the issue coming out Wednesday ." The future mum , now in her fourth month of pregnancy , wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump , " the magazine said .St . James ' s Palace which represents Catherine , her husband , Prince William , and his brother , Harry responded with dismay ." We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas , " a palace representative said . " This is a clear breach of the couple ' s right to privacy . "The Duchess , whose maiden name is Kate Middleton , has kept a low profile since the announcement in December she is set to give birth to her first child in July . Images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time .The Chi photos , though , are not her first encounter with paparazzi which tracked her during her long courtship with William , their engagement and their time since April 2011 as a married couple .The highest profile example came in September 2012 , when the French magazine Closer ran photographs of Catherine privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with William in France .Besides that magazine , some of those photos also were published in the Irish Daily Star newspaper and Chi , which according to its parent company Mondadori is a women ' s magazine with an average circulation of more than 218 , 000 and a readership well beyond that .Soon after the photos came out , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took legal action against Closer which was fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online .

FRESNO , CA Struggling through difficult times marked by war , economic despair , and political turmoil , the nation turned en masse this week to its newly appointed poet laureate , seeking solace in his words as so many generations of Americans have before in the words of laureates past .Despondent citizens from across the country began gathering this weekend outside the Fresno home of 83 year old Philip Levine , the California State University professor and poet who in less than two weeks will assume the widely celebrated title , beginning a yearlong term in which all Americans will turn their gaze upon him in search of hope and guidance ." We ' ve long relied on our poet laureates as a beacon of hope in times of trouble , " said 55 year old car mechanic Chuck Burgess , who traveled from Minneapolis to keep vigil alongside the many thousands waiting for the sagely Levine to emerge from his two story ranch house and take up his new mantle . " Their masterfully crafted verses and subtle explorations of interiority dispel the nation ' s fears in a way that nothing else can . "" Right now , America is eagerly anticipating his words , " added Burgess , later saying that he ' s been tracking Levine ' s work ever since it won the Levinson Prize from Poetry magazine in 1981 . " We ' re counting on the discursive lyricism and shifting postures of fractiousness for which Mr Levine ' s poems are renowned to lift our spirits . "According to reports , copies of Levine ' s 2004 collection Breath have been pulled down from bookshelves in living rooms throughout the nation , with friends and family gathering to reread the new laureate ' s free verse testaments to the persistence of life in the presence of coming darkness .In addition , because the nation ' s 300 million plus citizens don ' t want to miss a single word of what the poet has to say , continuous live news coverage from Fresno has preempted television programming on all channels ." There are few things Americans love more than poetry , " said Miami area real estate agent William Chen , who was among the masses assembled on Levine ' s front lawn . " At this point , one could even say that desire for intellectual stimulation through layered poetic musings might be the only thing holding our wounded nation together . "The position of United States poet laureate was introduced in 1937 , when Joseph Auslander became the first to receive the honor , his rarefied diction and reliably metered verses having provided comfort to a nation debilitated by the Great Depression . Since then , sources confirmed , his successors have unfailingly provided Americans with the poetry they need just to be able to get through their day ." Thank God this country has a poet laureate , " recently out of work glassworker Mitch Tate , 44 , told reporters . " Without 2004 2006 laureate Ted Kooser ' s profound lines likening the destruction of a galaxy billions of miles away to a snowflake falling on water , I ' m not sure we ever could have mustered the inner strength to overcome the devastation of Hurricane Katrina . "While the majority of Americans have read all 20 volumes of Levine ' s poetry as well as the collected works of each past laureate most agreed that seeing on paper works such as ' The Water ' s Chant , ' ' I Sing The Body Electric , ' and ' On The Meeting Of Garc a Lorca And Hart Crane ' had only partly satisfied their needs .Now , sources said , it is absolutely essential they hear him read his poems aloud ." With so many Americans struggling to get by , it ' s no wonder they ' re craving more intellectual nourishment from their nation ' s poets , " said Sen . Scott Brown ( R MA ) , standing among the cheering enthusiasts in Fresno . " The sheer excitement that overcomes our people when a poetry reading is announced tells you how badly we need this guy . "" Speak to us , poet , " Brown was later overheard saying as he gazed through Levine ' s window . " Invoke the muses and soothe our distempered hearts ! "As of press time , Levine had reportedly stepped out his front door to meet the hysterical crowd , immediately pacifying them with his mere presence ." Be still , my children , and listen , " said Levine , donning on a pair of wire rim glasses , opening a brown leather bound journal , and taking a seat on his porch swing . " I shall now read to you a poem entitled ' Milkweed . ' " 	 1
Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan speaks out against intolerance in IndiaHis comments have angered some members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party , with some even calling him a traitor .NEW DELHI : Popular Indian film actor Shah Rukh Khan has stirred a controversy by joining in the debate of rising intolerance in India , angering some extreme elements in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , with some even calling him a traitor .Recently , while interacting with the media and his fans on his birthday , the Bollywood superstar spoke out against rising levels of intolerance in India . He said : " The one thing I truly believe in is if there is intolerance to creativity and if there is intolerance to the country because of religion , we are taking away every forward step that the nation is taking . "But members of the BJP have criticised Mr Khan , saying he is attacking their administration . They even compared him to international terrorists . BJP lawmaker Yogi Adityanath said : " These people are speaking the language of militants . I think there is no difference in the language of Shah Rukh Khan and Hafiz Saeed . "Some politicians of the BJP have attacked the actor not just in television interviews but also on social media , terming him as a traitor who supports India ' s Pakistan . However , senior members of the BJP have distanced themselves from these remarks .Several supporters of the popular actor have come out in his defence , and attacked the BJP . Said Indian actor Raza Murad : " This country is not anyone ' s personal property . We don ' t need anyone ' s permission , sympathy or certificate to live here . "Mr Khan has not retracted his comments , saying he is very much an Indian and stands by his views . One of the most popular film stars in India , Mr Khan is respected for his well informed views on issues of national and international importance .Just three years ago , he was detained at a US airport by security officials , and his comment to them I am Khan and I am not a terrorist alluding to his Muslim faith gave him a cult status for speaking out against racial profiling .Now , by lending his voice to the debate on tolerance levels in India , Mr Khan is once again in the eye of a controversy . ? 	 0
WASHINGTON Longtime political adviser and Republican strategist Karl Rove announced Aug . 13 that he would step down from his role as White House deputy chief of staff to spend more time in the shadows and devote his energy to the things he really cares about , such as creeping , slithering , and disappearing for all time into an ever darkening realm shut off from hope and goodness ." I ' ve been away from the shadows too long , and it ' s put a strain on my relationship with those black forces I hold dear , " an emotional but upbeat Rove said . " There are many personal projects I ' d like to pursue all alone in an opaque void , where God Himself dares not peer , so this just seemed like the perfect opportunity to slink off into murky blackness . "Rove , who planned to return at the stroke of midnight Aug . 31 to the mysterious underworld from which he emerged two decades ago to do the bidding of masters unknown , claimed he never felt comfortable operating within the visible light spectrum . The often controversial figure said he was looking forward to " getting away from it all " and prowling like a wolf on the wind in that ashen realm where deeds unthinkable know no name or order ." I am excited to give this new chapter of my life the shadowy obfuscation it deserves , " Rove said . " There are some matters that should just be kept private , far from the prying gaze of mortal eyes and wicked Sun . "While some Washington insiders were surprised by Rove ' s announcement , others close to him said they were happy he finally decided to fully enter the shroud of night ." The one called Karl Rove hath lingered too much in daylight , " said one source on the condition of anonymity . " The one called Karl Rove feels an undeniable pull toward the sly and inky veil of twilight and longs for the warm embrace of its formless depths . "Upon hearing of Rove ' s decision to retreat into Styxian obscurity , a number of White House aides and various officials throughout the nation ' s capital hurriedly gathered their personal belongings and proceeded to the nearest exit . 	 1

New York Major League Baseball has banned the entire fan base of the New York Mets from participating in any aspect of the game . The ruling by new MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred takes effect immediately and lasts until the end of the current season ." No rooting . No cheering . No blogging . No comments . The suspension applies to all fan style activities , " Manfred said . " If the players have to live without their drugs , then so too do their supporters . It is hoped that this stringent punishment will put an end to the use of delusion enhancing drugs by followers of the game . "MLB drug investigators were working on several cases involving players during spring training in Florida , when they spotted an unusually high number of delusional fan comments in Mets media coverage ." These statements were completely over the top , " Manfred said . " Things like : the Mets were going to win more games than they lose this year . Or : Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson was going to give up his disastrous baseball career for a spot on the professional crocheting circuit . Or : Mets Manager Terry Collins was going to count off the number of bases without using his fingers . There was a seemingly endless stream of fantasy statements like these . "Sure enough , when the fans who made the crazy comments were confronted , they readily admitted to using delusion enhancing drugs . LSD , cocaine and bath salts , were all part of their game . The general consensus was you had to be on something to follow the Mets .Manager Terry Collins was devastated by the suspensions . " I remember the days when a case of Rheingold was all you needed to enjoy a ballgame , " he said . " My beer is Rheingold , the dry beer . Look for Rheingold whenever you buy beer . I love that jingle . "One unnamed MLB insider argued that the Mets deserve to be playing in an empty Citi Field . " Here ' s a team that didn ' t seem to have the time to seek out a professional shortstop , " he said . " That ' s like a golfer without a putter or a racecar with three wheels . But what do you expect from an organization that ' s owned by a Bernie Madoff buddy and run by a bunch of bean counters ? "The Mets have acknowledged their connection to Madoff with the development of a new defensive tactic called the Ponzi Play . It involves leveraging the price of Citi Field luxury suites with computer controlled shortselling of pine tar futures .Also in the works was a special tribute night called Salute to Drug Enforcement . The highlight of the event : A convicted DEA agent was to serve his sentence , strapped to an electric chair provided by Bob ' s Discount Furniture , the official furniture furnisher of every New York sports team you can think of ." We were going to throw in the Ottoman and a pair of matching end tables , " Bob said . " And his next of kin had their eye on one of our convertible couch caskets . But sometimes the breaks don ' t go your way . "As part of the suspension agreement , Mets fans will hand over 3 million worth of hallucinogens to the Take a Trip Foundation , a nonprofit organization which grants psychedelic experiences to indigent junkies . 	 1
At least 200 people were evacuated from their homes , including 84 residents of an apartment building for the elderly , after a tanker truck carrying 9 , 000 gallons of gasoline erupted early Wednesday in a northern Boston suburb .Firefighters battle a blaze Wednesday north of Boston after a tanker overturned carrying 9 , 000 gallons of gas .No serious injuries were reported in the Everett , Massachusetts , blast , but witnesses recounted close calls to a local television station . One man said he narrowly escaped from his car before it exploded ." In consideration of everything that firefighters had to deal with , I think it ' s a miracle that we haven ' t seen some serious injuries , " Everett Fire Chief David Butler said .The tanker overturned and caught fire at a traffic circle in the town of about 37 , 000 outside Boston . Officials are investigating whether the driver was speeding , Butler said ." Our major concerns right now are we still have an ongoing fire operation in the family dwellings , and we are still heavily engaged in those operations , and we have some concerns environmentally , " Butler said . Watch residents of an elderly housing complex describe their shockFlames from the truck engulfed at least 40 cars and three buildings , two of them houses , fire officials said . The truck was destroyed , but the driver was not seriously injured , the officials said .WCVB TV in Boston identified the driver as Chad LaFrance of Dover , New Hampshire .Seven hours after the truck caught fire , firefighters were still battling a blaze in one of the homes , according to the television station .One evacuee who fled a high rise building told the television station he saw at least 15 cars burning ."

At first , he thought it was a car accident , but when he went outside to investigate the noise , he saw fire " just coming down the hill toward the houses as fast as you could think . "Barrow tried to escape in his car , but fire quickly surrounded the vehicle , he told the TV station ." I rode over the fire and my car caught fire , " he told WCVB .

Blast City , about 2 , 000 miles north of Last City , the capital of Lost City , in the Disunited States , was rocked by nearly five billion blasts late last night .The impact of the blasts was so great , said an eyewitness , that there were absolutely no remains of bodies or debris anywhere in the entire city .The eyewitness said it was impossible to disclose the exact number of blasts but admitted that it could be about five billion .The eyewitness later succumbed to injuries in the city ' s main hospital which later shut down due to non availability of medical and non medical staff .A badly injured Blast City Mayor Mastar Blastar told a press conference that was not attended by any media representative that the city was having a blast when the blasts occurred one after the other , with a 59 second time gap .Blastar died of shock a little later , sources who did not wish to be identified , stated .Police officials in the blasted city were all believed dead and were thus not available for comment .Rescue services from neighboring towns , cities , districts and nations have been requisitioned . The United Nations has also been approached for assistance .A spokesperson for Secretary General Kofi Annan said the request would be discussed threadbare at a General Assembly meeting in a week and would be granted only after approval of all participants of the meeting .World leaders , including United States President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have blasted those responsible for the blasts . We will request Israel to launch precision missile attacks against those responsible , no matter which part of the world they were in , they asserted in a very strongly worded statement released exclusively to CNN and BBC .Bush has offered to personally adopt the blast stricken city . He also named it a sister city of New York City .All major television stations have decided to black out coverage of the blasts as it would give undue publicity to terrorists they stated .CNN and BBC , however , decided to run blank screens for 24 hours as a mark of respect for the victims .Guinness Book of World Records officials are investigating the authenticity of the reports of the blasts for inclusion in the 2006 edition of the best selling book . 	 1
The people of France have spoken , in French , to send a stark message to their political parties by choosing another country to rule over them .In a remarkable turn of events , the country of Holland will assume the French presidency after defeating centre right political shortarse Nicolas Sarkozy .Holland ' s winning manifesco promised free clogs and tulips for all French households and that appears to have swung the vote their way combined with a general disenchantment with mainstream French politics .Nicolas Sarkozy couldn ' t hide his disbelief in his concession speech , " Whilst I accept the result I find it amazing that such a proud nation of people could choose to be ruled by another country . It defy ' s common sense . I know my policies have been unpopular but I thought that having a stunning wife would distract people into not thinking about my ridiculous policies . I shall be divorcing Carla ( Bruni ) immediately . It ' s all her fault , clearly she is not beautiful enough to distract red blooded Frenchmen . Either that or there are more gay men than we thought . "Some political analysts believe that this stunning win for Holland could open the door to other countries choosing to be ruled by neighbouring nations . Already we have seen a number of German politicians express a desire to take over Hungary and Austria , purely for noble reasons this time .However , one politician is vehemently opposed to foreign countries intruding into his country . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is disgusted by the outcome of the French election and reckons that the English shouldn ' t get any similar ideas . He said , " I ' ve spent my entire life trying to get independence for Scotland and there is no chance we will surrender our powers back to the English . Trust the French to cave in when another country comes knocking . Italy will probably be next . Europe is risking becoming a laughing stock . Well trust me , Scotland will not be following suit . "One thing is for sure . This result will send shockwaves throughout Europe and the rest of the world . 	 1
COCONUT CREEK , FL Less than five months after graduating from Bayshore High School , 18 year old Henry Doyle returned to his lowly alma mater Monday a wise and conquering college freshman ." I ' m back , Bayshore High , " Doyle announced as he pulled his mother ' s Toyota Camry slowly into the parking lot normally reserved for faculty , emerging with a knowing grin . " Bet you never thought you ' d see the likes of me again ! "After pausing to behold any students who might have taken notice of his momentous arrival , Doyle determined that many were too intimidated to say hello or even look in his general direction , so he marched indoors .According to sources , the Nova Southeastern University freshman spent the next two hours striding like a Roman general through the halls of his former school , smiling at distracted teachers , nodding at confused members of the janitorial staff , and leaning back against the school ' s trophy case for nearly 25 minutes ." Some of the kids who don ' t know who I am will probably just think I ' m some hip , young teacher , " the returning hero said as he was repeatedly pushed aside by a crowd of students rushing to get to class . " And I bet those who do know me will be shocked at how much taller and more mature I look . Some of them might even flip out . '" For one thing , I didn ' t have this bad boy back then , " added Doyle , tracing his finger along a finely bearded jawline .The first of many stops made by Doyle during his exultant tour of Bayshore High was the school ' s main office , where in his younger days he had helped sort the faculty mail . After waiting several minutes for Ms . Karpman , the school secretary , to get off the phone , and being mistaken for another student by the name of " Frank , " Doyle was warmly welcomed back by the receptionist , who was struck silent by his confidence and charm ." Did you see her face ? " Doyle asked reporters . " She almost had a heart attack when I explained to her who I was . "Following a brief excursion to the cafeteria , where he lamented the meager options available to those " still in high school , " and wondered how " kids not yet in college " could eat so early in the day , the towering freshman reportedly decided to visit his favorite former teacher .Doyle said he eagerly anticipated seeing Mrs Shelton , who had wished him luck in his yearbook and invited him to drop by if he was ever in the neighborhood . Striding up to her as she entered her third period class , Doyle had just begun explaining the advantages of a college caliber syllabus over a standard high school course outline when the bell rang ." I thought she might ask me to sit in , but she just sort of waved goodbye and started class , " Doyle said . " I knew I ' d probably be way too distracting to those kids , so I decided to just hang out in the hall until she was done . "It was during this period of waiting , sources reported , that Doyle encountered seniors Greg Hollis and Vanessa Pope , both of whom were in his trigonometry class the previous year ." They were pretty taken aback , " Doyle said . " I bet they thought I ' d be too stuck up to visit this place or to talk to people like them . Probably the last thing they ever expected was for me to offer my e mail so that we could hang out the next time I ' m around . "Hollis and Pope confirmed that their former classmate had taken time from his glorious homecoming to offer them words of encouragement ." It was a little weird , " Hollis said . " We never really talked before . He said I probably remembered him without the beard , so I said yeah , that was it . I didn ' t even know he graduated . I thought he was our age . "With the guidance counselor he had hoped to visit away on vacation , and a couple of large 10th graders giving him a hard time , Doyle said the moment had come for him to once again take his leave of Bayshore High ." I ' ll head over to McDonald ' s , I think , " Doyle told reporters with a quick nod . " Some of the guys I used to hang out with might be there . Plus , I don ' t think I can handle all this attention for much longer . Best to just leave everyone wanting more . "And with that , Doyle exited his school via the same double doors through which he had entered a mere six hours before ." Don ' t worry , though , " he added . " I ' ll be back . " 	 1
Football Association chairman Greg Dyke will back moves to bring video replays in to help referees for key decisions such as awarding penalties .Dyke is uncertain about FIFA president Sepp Blatter ' s idea to allow managers a number of challenges to referees ' decisions but believes video replays should be brought in .The FA has a powerful voice as it has one of the eight votes on the International FA Board ( IFAB ) , the game ' s law making body , along with Scotland , Wales , Northern Ireland and FIFA , which has four votes . The IFAB is due to discuss proposals in March .Greg Dyke agrees with Sepp Blatter that referees should get to use video replays to get decisions rightFA chairman Greg Dyke doesn ' t think a challenge system is the best way forward , unlike the FIFA proposalsDyke told Sky Sports News : ' I for instance would allow a referee to go straight to the cameras replay for a penalty but you can ' t do that for every decision or the match would never finish .' You don ' t want to throw the game away you have seen in rugby where referees hardly make a decision about tries now , that wouldn ' t be a good idea for soccer but I do think use of technology should be considered carefully .' In 10 years ' time I think we will look back and think " wasn ' t it quaint we didn ' t use technology to help make certain decisions " . 'Asked about Blatter ' s idea for allowing challenges by coaches , Dyke added : ' I ' m not sure about managers being able to throw in the towel and say ' we want to challenge that ' .Sepp Blatter has announced his intention to run again as FIFA President at the age of 79 next year' I do think the laws on technology will change but it will take time and we have to do it slowly , try certain things and see if it works because you could disrupt the game completely if you are not careful . 'Meanwhile , Dyke reiterated his view that it is ' a mistake ' for Blatter to stand for a fifth term in office but did not back the one other person who has said he will stand for FIFA president , the French former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne .Dyke said : ' I think it ' s a mistake , I don ' t think he should be standing . He stood last time on the basis that he would not be standing again . He is 78 and will be 82 or 83 when the term finishes and it always good to let younger people have their time .' The FA would like to see another candidate and a proper competition . The FA will decide who it supports at a later stage if we think there is a serious candidate but he Blatter is probably going to win if anybody stands anyway . 'England were unable to sell out Wembley against Norway and face another low attendance for San MarinoDyke also said the pressure that had been building on England manager Roy Hodgson had been totally lifted by the 2 0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland .' You could feel the pressure building up on Roy and that one result has killed it . It was a very good performance and our younger players played very well in what was the hardest match in the group .' We now have a very good chance go to France with a young side and hopefully do well . 'Dyke admitted that England ' s next home match against San Marino would be ' a hard sell ' to fans , but added : ' It would have been a much harder sell if we had not won in Switzerland . San Marino ' s a hard sell at the best of times . ' 	 0
If you ' re single , there ' s never been a better time to look for someone special . Dating standards are at record lows , which means it ' s a daters market ! Here are a few tips on how to meet a romantic partner with the new lower dating standards :1 ) Go up to anyone , wherever you are , whatever they look like , and introduce yourself . When standards were higher , daters were forced to assess whether a potential partner was " good enough " for them , but those days are gone .2 ) Strike up a conversation . If the person doesn ' t speak English or speak at all , try to listen to his or her body language .3 ) Find something you two have in common . Even if it ' s just that you both breathe , talk about that .4 ) Start to flirt . If you ' re not quite ready to make physical contact with this person because he or she ' s twitching uncontrollably or covered in scabs , just flash him or her a coy smile .5 ) Make up an excuse to meet up again . Tell your potential mate that you have to go to a parole meeting next Tuesday , too , or that you ' ll be at the methadone Thursday as well .7 ) Dress for success . Or don ' t , because it doesn ' t matter now that the standards have been lowered . Wear your sweats out to dinner if you want because it ' s possible your date will be wearing a t shirt and no bottoms .8 ) Have an open mind . Remember , there are no " deal breakers " anymore . If your new partner has an elementary school education , an STD , a penchant for lying , or a collection of pet scorpions , remember it ' s our differences that make us all special .Good luck out there and let the romance begin ! 	 1

just down the road a ways the chamber of commerce of the gateway to death is having a bus tour. the attendees of this gala are sparse. the gateway of death's mayor and safety service director were expecting a much larger turnout, but only three people showed up. it is a free tour, too, and the gateway of death will be having a little shindig immediately after this bus tour. the ruse and the prize : all you can eat hot dogs and all you can drink lemonade. yesterday, the mayor was heard saying to a small town newspaper reporter, " those hot dogs, they really reel'em in. at last week's ribbon cutting for the chicken and pig slaughterhouse, we had a couple hundred come. they all came for the eats. " the gateway to death's former name was piccadilly. the former name was flowery and beautiful. but the gateway to death's town leaders figured a more apropos appellation should at least be reflective of what their borough is all about and they decided to give the place a far more menacing and deadly moniker. that's because the village is filled with every type of noxious industry on the planet. a hazardous waste incinerator that burns nuclear waste at a rate of 24 7, 365 days a year is the keystone player in the local economy. it belches out half baked, refried and re dyed atomic pollution like the grand coulee dam churns out water. remnants of the half live breakdowns of technetium, francium, radon, actinium, neptunium, and einsteinium fill the atmosphere. so if you visit the gateway of death, it's best to bring along a gas mask retrofitted to filter out atomic air pollution. the air you breathe smells and tastes like mustard gas with a sprinkling of cyanide and arsenic. four smokestacks pointing up to a black hole sun tower in the air like skyscrapers. a more primitive people would see these gigantic spiraling monstrosities and most likely fall down on their knees in worship. yah yah, hey yah, yah yah, hey, hey, hey ya hey ya, is what they'd most likely chant. a landfill holding medical waste, including the corpses of dead rats and mice used in scientific experiments at hospitals and medical testing facilities from all over the world, is another key cog in the economic solvency of the little hamlet. also deposited are the scatterings of monkey, rat, and mouse bowel movements. this fecal matter is collected from lab chimps, along with medical rats and mice on a worldwide level. every primate and rodent that has suffered immensely through medical researching experiments and has taken a crap over the course of the last 15 years is very well represented here. most of the experiments deal with testing for aids, hiv, various types of cancer, smallpox, ebola, creutzfeldt jakob disease ( or mad cow disease caught by human beings ), and the bubonic plague. the foul smelling material dumped is so noxious and hazardous that workers dress like astronauts just to be safe from being poisoned by this biological train wreck of refuse. but the pay isn't bad. workers start at 95 an hour and there is a 10 increase to any employee who lives and lasts more than three months. this landfill is humongous, the size of three contiguous 18 hole golf courses laid side to side. there is also a lake of nuclear waste almost as large as the honey island swamp in louisiana. it glows in the dark and catches fire during the day, even in times of teeming sheets of rain. the deep, thick, soupy mess is colored a psychedelic mix of purple, green, orange, blue, purple and red. fly ash from the lake floats in the air like swarms of mosquitos. inhaling these poisonous flakes and particulates would be about as dangerous as drinking drano. some hooligan kids drunk and up to no good during spring break a few years ago decided to go skinny dipping in this neon like swamp and the next day, all that was left were their skeletons. when the gateway to death police department found their remains, these victims stuck out from the swamp surface like insects caught in a fly tape. on the bus, the tour guide who is also the gateway to death's president of the chamber of commerce stands in front, near the bus driver, as the vehicle lurches through the potholed streets of the gateway to death. he barks into a microphone, " we have the highest safety standards of any super polluted city in the entire u s of a. the environmental pollution agency is here at least twice a year. we have a seven star rating. that's the highest, by the way. " " we're now passing the nuclear fission factory, " he snaps 	 1
MINNEAPOLIS Tragedy has once again befallen 27 year old pizza delivery driver Dick Donovan , whose beloved " Grandma Melissa " died Monday at age 87 following a long battle with heart cancer . She was Donovan ' s sixth grandmother to pass on in the past eight months .Donovan ' s biggest loss since the untimely death of his Grandma Brittany last Friday , Grandma Melissa ' s passing forced the aspiring bass guitarist to miss work at D ' Angelo ' s Pizza for three days in order to attend the family matriarch ' s funeral ." Yeah , Mike , I ' m at the service right now , " Donovan told Mike Mosedale , his boss at D ' Angelo ' s Pizza , via telephone from the First Avenue Funeral Home in downtown Minneapolis . " It ' s very moving , you know , and she looks really natural , and I have a suit on . "" She was a big Widespread Panic fan , " Donovan added . " That ' s why you can hear them in the background . "Though he is remaining stoic , the tragic loss has clearly shaken Donovan . " It ' s never easy to lose one grandma , " Donovan said . " But to lose as many as I have , well , it ' s almost too much to bear . "Donovan ' s string of grandmother passings began this past February , when paternal grandmother Trish Donovan suffered a fatal leukemia attack , causing Donovan to miss two days of work and a weekend ice fishing trip to Rainy Lake with a group of friends . Barely a month later , Elaine Donovan , another paternal grandmother , succumbed to arthritis just before friend Jimmy Gaines held an all day 26th birthday bash , which Donovan described as " apparently awesome . "" I understand the party was incredible , especially the part where Jimmy got so wasted , he threw up on the ping pong table , " Donovan said . " It ' s just too bad I missed it , what with the death of that last grandmother and all . "The string of deaths continued in May , when the mothers of Donovan ' s adoptive parents died on the same weekend , of Babe Ruth ' s Disease and multiple dystrophy , just before the opening of Star Wars : Episode I and his band ' s gig at Lee ' s Liquor Lounge .But the most recent loss , Donovan said , may be the most painful yet ." To think I ' m never gonna see her knit and do all that old lady stuff again really hurts , " Donovan said . " And , what ' s worse , I just found out one of my grandfathers is sick . They say he might not last until the open air Battle Of The Bands show on the 18th down at Peavey Plaza . "" Whoa , I ' ve got to go now , " the grief stricken Donovan added . " Brad Zellar ' s van is coming up the street . We ' re totally road tripping to the wake . " 	 1
A Devon farmer is today recovering in hospital following a freak accident in his field yesterday , which resulted in a full helicopter rescue and airlift to hospital .The farmer , believed to be in his 40 ' s , has been a victim of the recent credit crunch , and as a result has had to put in some overtime in his cucumber field .According to local sources , at around 8pm last night , the farmer began collecting the days cuttings of cucumbers and laying them in boxes ready to be collected for a local grocer in the dark , when , under circumstances currently being investigated , the farmer accidentally slipped on a rogue cucumber and sent himself flying off his feet .In trying to steady himself from the topple , the farmer tried grabbing the box of cucumbers and in turn sent them flying upwards also .The farmer somehow ended up landing bottom first Straight onto the rake which he had earlier been using in the field , effectively sodomising himself into a painful position of which he was unable to move out of .His wife , upon hearing his screams came to his aid , and found the poor farmer sat on the rake and covered in cucumbers , at which point she raised the alarm .Moments later , an ambulance arrived and called for the air rescue helicopter to airlift the now rather embarrassed and shocked farmer to hospital .The helicopter having arrived with a doctor on board then whisked the farmer off to hospital However due to the precarious nature of the injuries sustained , the crew were unable to transport him in the helicopter and instead winched him to hospital dangling 10 feet below the helicopter with the instrument still firmly inside him .Eye witnesses on the ground reported seeing a T shaped object hovering below the helicopter making funny noises , before realising that it was a human being with an instrument sticking out of him .' We had no choice but to leave him hanging It was an unusual accident We don ' t get many farmers playing with their cucumbers and instruments in this way ' said a hospital spokesman this morning .The farmer , was rushed straight into hospital where he underwent 10 hours of surgery to remove the item from him .His wife released a statement this morning thanking the doctors and hospital staff for al their hard work , and hinted that the farmer may need rehabilitation to walk properly again .For now at least , this farmers field of cucumbers is laying dormant . 	 1
Immensely popular social networking site , Facebook , are to set up a new department for dealing with blackmail ." For the past few years , " said CEO Mark Zuckerberg , " Everybody and his dog and sometimes their cat too have been uploading pictures of themselves to our servers . "According to Zuckerberg , most people do not realise that the small print on the site concedes the rights of every photograph to Facebook ." We own all these people ' s most treasured memories , " said Zuckerberg . " Better yet , we have access to all those photos that have no sharing on them , because they ' re rude or would get the tagged person arrested . "The new department at Facebook will have two core aims ." Firstly , " said Zuckerberg , " people who have their entire life on there and are aged over forty probably don ' t have backups of the pictures . This is especially true for mobile uploads . We will ask for a dollar a picture to make sure they don ' t accidentally get deleted . "With an estimated four billion pictures covered by this , Zuckerberg would catapult himself among the world ' s richest men ." Secondly , my staff have been trawling through all the salacious pictures , " said Zuckerberg . " Some of these are very juicy . It would be a tragedy if any of these photographs were to get into the public domain . "Inside sources believe that there are several million such pictures ." Pricing on these juicy pictures will be on a case by case basis , " said Zuckerberg . " Some of them must be worth millions easily . "So far there has been no opposition to this move , with all the organisations who would normally cry foul suspiciously quiet . This has been put down to the fact that the Blackmail department has been up and running for several months already . 	 1
in standard teenage girl throwing a tantrum format, the talentless nobody, amber coffman, dramatically accused well known music publicist, heathcliff berru, of sexual assault. on monday afternoon, coffman, best known for her vocal contribution to the band dirty projectors, posted a series of malicious tweets, one of which claimed " a very popular music publicist rubbed my ass and bit my hair at a bar a couple years ago. " the tweets continued late into the evening, eventually naming berru, the founder and ceo of life or death pr management, as the assailant. it is unclear whether alcohol provoked this 31 year old, struggling musician, to finally break her silence. in an interview with the cbc yesterday, coffman shared her story. " it was just crazy, " she said, preparing herself to describe the traumatic experience she survived and what has undoubtedly been the reason her music career fell off like it did. in early 2013, when the assault is alleged to have occurred, coffman was attending a concert at the bowery ballroom in manhattan. during a private gathering back stage at the venue, coffman gave berru her phone number. after the exchange, the group walked to a nearby bar to host the after party. " i'd just gotten a drink and i saw him berru from the other side of the room, " coffman recounts. " and he walks over to me. " while greeting coffman, berru is alleged to have leaned toward her and rubbed his hand on her bottom. " i just completely froze. i was totally shocked, " she said during the interview. bravely, coffman told berru that she'd " be right back! " and ran to her three male friends. " i told them,'that guy over there just grabbed my ass.'" coffman had her friends escort her back to where berru was to get her drink, and claimed berru offered her a compliment before he touched her hair. " considering how dangerous the situation was, the ultimate goal was just surviving it, " coffman confessed. tragically, amber coffman has been living with the effects of this trauma for 3 years. members of the indie music community have remained silent on the issue. in an age where anybody with a twitter account is permitted to inflict irreparable damage with impunity, it's often safer to remain silent. however, truth media was able to obtain comment from several professionals in the industry, conditional on securing anonymity. " when i first heard about the tweets, i thought it was a joke, " one musician commented. " i never imagined the story would gain traction like it has. it shouldn't even be a story. " " it's the great witch hunt of today, " another said. " everybody is eager to burn someone at the stake regardless the accusation. even if heath did do it, when did a flirty gesture fall into the same category as rape. it's disgusting. " a female colleague close to coffman had this to say : " i'm appalled. having actually been a victim of sexual assault and still dealing with the post traumatic stress that something like rape causes i don't know. i feel like she's trying to minimize what happened to me. i don't support what she's doing. " during the interview with cbc, coffman admitted having not given any thought to the gravity this story would have. " i'm not a vindictive person, " she added. " i don't think revenge feels good. " following coffman's inaugural tweets, several other woman have claimed similar experiences while drinking with berru. berru resigned from his company earlier this week and released a statement to la weekly. his statement began, " there have been several reports about my alleged inappropriate behavior which deserve a response. i am deeply sorry for those who i have offended by my actions and how i have made certain women feel. if i crossed the line of decency or respectfulness in situations when i was drunk and under the influence, there is no excuse of course. " in response to berru's apology, coffman said, " i thought his statement was pretty offensive, to be honest. " " there can be times when people mess up a bit and they get help i'm still trying to figure out where i sit with that but in a case with someone like heathcliff, for him to hurt so many people over and over again i just don't know if there's any coming back from that. " " i don't feel sorry for him, " coffman said, concluding the interview. " i hope men will see it as a wakeup call 	 1

washington a report on growing disparities in the concentration of u. s. aluminum can wealth, released tuesday by the department of commerce, revealed that 66 percent of the nation's recyclable assets are now held by the poorest 1 percent of the population. according to the sobering report, the disproportionate distribution of soda can wealth is greater than ever before, and has become one of the worst instances of economic inequality in the nation's history. data showed that over salvaging of cans by a small and elite group of can horders has created a steadily growing and possibly unbridgeable gap between the rich and the mega poor. " although our nation's upper middle class actually consumes the most beverages, a staggering percentage of these cans wind up in the hands of a very few, " said economist cynthia pierce, who worked as a consultant on the three year, 14 million government study. " it's a troubling trend. and as a tiny fraction of the population continues to maintain its stranglehold on redeemable can wealth, it's a trend that shows no sign of slowing. " according to pierce, the study points to a distinct economic advantage for the most can affluent those who possess the resources necessary to collect, transport, separate, and accumulate more and more cans than the rest of the population. " members of this exclusive group come from exceedingly poor backgrounds and have access to outrageously low levels of education, which makes them much better prepared to reap the benefits of digging around in garbage, " pierce added. the report details several key factors involved in the lopsided distribution of container wealth, including aggressive foraging, which leads to higher returns on deposits and a tendency to reinvest can profits in additional redeemables, such as beer. in addition, the report found that those involved in the returnable gathering industry often minimize financial risk by diversifying between aluminum cans and glass bottle holdings. while less than 1 percent of americans own the domestic rights to a majority of coca cola and pepsi cans, this same group has also cornered the international market by branching out into such imported container commodities as fanta and perrier. " the typical american spends an average of 65 on beverages for every dollar he or she earns back through redeemable deposits, and the rest of that money goes to the country's can and bottle barons, " the report stated. " americans who are at a foraging disadvantage due to over employment and home ownership therefore have limited access to these discarded commodities, causing the market to unfairly favor those with an exclusively disposables income. " perhaps more alarming, the report continued, the can monopoly enjoyed by the poorest 1 percent has been unintentionally buoyed by millions of environment conscious americans who leave plastic bags full of recycling in front of their homes, which are in turn preyed upon by enterprising collectors. " these people were born into a lifestyle, often going back generations, where any can left on the street is seen as their birthright, whether they purchased it or not, " houston resident dale palmer said. " they have the knowledge and ability to get out there and scoop up all the good cans before anyone even knew they were there. " the vast disparity in can wealth distribution is difficult to understand for many americans. most people, according to the report, cannot relate to the lifestyles of the super poor, who never have to go to work, pay a mortgage, or struggle to find money for rent. one canned individual cited in the study is can tycoon will dorsey, a 33 year old detroit resident who spent his childhood living off the funds collected from his family's vast can holdings. at the age of 16, dorsey inherited five carts and dozens of garbage bags overflowing with recyclables when his father passed away unexpectedly one cold december morning. according to economist and new york times columnist paul krugman, people like dorsey, who maintain an ultra poor lifestyle that is vastly different from the rest of the population, are egregiously out of touch with the everyday economic realities of mainstream america. " dorsey is one of those select few who come from old can money, " krugman said. " they're just hoarding their assets so nobody else can benefit. and then they parade down the street with their carts full of recycling. " in the wake of the report's disturbing findings, many citizens claim to feel exploited by those who convert their discarded property into cash or change without sharing the incredible profits. " it's not fair, " chicago native melissa arnold said. " something should be done to even the playing field. " in an attempt to mitigate the disparities in soda can wealth distribution, congress is currently exploring numerous options, including levying an 80 percent tax on the incomes of those possessing 100 or more refundable containers, 	 1
Daniel Donovan , the prosecutor in the case surrounding the death of an African American man at the hands of a white police officer , was endorsed by the Staten Island Republican Party this weekend as their pick to replace resigned GOP Rep . Michael Grimm , according to local reports .Party Chairman John Antoniello chose Donovan after interviewing both him and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis , who has also expressed interest in the seat . Antoniello said , however , the 31 member executive committee showed their support " overwhelmingly in favor of Dan " in an informal poll ." At the end of the day , we felt , the committee felt , overwhelmingly that Dan Donovan would make a better candidate , " he said , according to the Staten Island Advance .Though the Brooklyn Republican Party has yet to endorse a candidate and has informally expressed support for Malliotakis , Staten Island makes up the vast majority of the district ' s population , and the SIGOP ' s endorsement all but ensures Donovan will win the GOP primary outright .The endorsement , which came as no surprise , was issued Saturday , the day after Donovan officially launched his bid for the seat .National Republicans have privately expressed some concerns over Donovan ' s involvement in the case concerning Eric Garner , the African American man who died at the hands of a white police officer following a banned chokehold . Donovan was prosecutor in the case in which the grand jury decided not to indict the police officer , a decision that fueled further anger and protests from Americans nationwide frustrated by what they see as the unfair treatment of minorities by law enforcement .Grimm won a decisive victory despite the cloud of controversy hanging over him after he was indicted last spring on 20 counts , including the tax fraud charge to which he ultimately pleaded guilty , which could result in jail time .The swing district has long been a top target for Democrats , but their hopes for an early pickup this cycle grew when Grimm announced his plans to resign from the seat after entering his guilty plea shortly before the start of the new Congress . 	 0

boston mental health professionals have long characterized attempted suicide as a desperate cry for help, the last ditch plea of a wounded soul who, more than anything else, longs to live. not so, according to a study released monday by the national psychiatric association. npa researchers say those who try to take their own lives are, in fact, crying out for the sweet release of death. " people who want to live don't typically engage in such behaviors as wrist slashing and carbon monoxide inhalation, " said dr rachel leibman wald, head of the npa study. " to the contrary, this tends to be the behavior of individuals who long to depart this mortal coil and be enveloped in the warm, safe shroud of eternal rest. " " when one is in terrible pain, be it physical or emotional, " leibman wald continued, " the natural instinct is to end that pain, even if it means ending one's life. sometimes, there is a viable alternative method of ending that pain other than suicide. sometimes, there is not. " conventional psychiatric wisdom holds that a suicide attempt is the brain's subconscious way of telling loved ones that an individual is in need of assistance. " it now appears, however, " the npa report read, " that in many cases, the attempted suicide is less a cry for help than simply a message from the brain to the body saying,'okay, time to die.'" because mental health professionals'ability to provide the help such individuals are " asking for " is limited, and many patients are so mired in depression that they are beyond redemption anyway, many see in the study's findings a powerful argument for greater societal tolerance of suicidal behavior. " we are finally learning that for some, suicide is not an attempt to get treatment, a step, if you will, on the road to healing, " said noted psychotherapist dr eli wasserbaum. " in a majority of cases, it is a step into painless oblivion where nothing can hurt you ever again. " in examining more than 2, 500 case studies, npa psychiatrists found that many suicidal patients did not fit the classic profile of someone desperately attempting to make his or her plight known to the outside world. instead, in many cases, they simply represented horrible failures whose pitiful, ruined lives were unbearable. " many of these individuals were so pathetic, " the report read, " that any decent person would have to agree that they would be better off dead. why prolong their pain? what point would there be? " with this in mind, npa psychiatrists argued that it is not only erroneous to assume that those who attempt suicide need help, but it may actually be cruel. " to deny someone suffering a shattered, miserable existence the simple escape offered by suicide is nothing short of inhumane, " said dr stanley temple, one of the study's co authors. " if you look at many of these nobodies, you'd be hard pressed to argue that they would have even a slight chance of ever getting their lives into any semblance of a livable state. for these tortured, far gone souls, it becomes more obvious each day that there is only one way out. who are we as mental health professionals to deny them this effective way out of their agony? " temple cited the case of gregory fryar, a 49 year old harwich, ma, man whose six failed marriages, dead end job at a bread factory, lifelong addictions to alcohol and gambling, and two appearances on the jenny jones show with various dysfunctional relatives led him to attempt suicide in march 1995. misdiagnosed as a cry for help, the attempt led to years of hospitalization and counseling, which failed to improve his ugly, embarrassing existence. " had fryar's physicians been more tolerant of his heartfelt and entirely justified longing for death, perhaps his agony would have ended five years ago, " temple said. " instead, this poor excuse for a life continues to this day. who are we truly helping by giving such patients the'help'they neither asked for nor wanted, when they could have easily found peace if left to their own suicidal devices? " said leibman wald : " there are lots of people out there who don't want to die, and for good reason : their problems simply aren't bad enough. let's focus on helping these people, people who have valid reasons to live, instead of wasting all this time and energy trying to help those who have very valid reasons to want to die. " leibman wald said she hopes the study will help change public perceptions of suicide and usher in a more enlightened climate in which the needs of those who want to die are no longer ignored. " hopefully, someday, suicidal individuals'right to pursue their goal of death will be recognized and respected 	 1
( EW . com ) Well . . . you can ' t say " Cougar Town ' s " cast and producers didn ' t try .The third season of ABC ' s comedy returned significantly lower in the ratings . In its new ( and much tougher ) time period , " Cougar Town " delivered 4 . 8 million viewers and a 1 . 8 adults 18 49 rating Tuesday night . This is a series low for the show ( The CW ' s " Ringer " also had some particularly bad news , below ) .It ' s arguably unfair to compare " Cougar Town " to its own 3 . 4 premiere last year ( from which it ' s down 47 percent ) . The show debuted in the fall on Wednesday nights with a lead in from top rated " Modern Family . " Whereas last night ' s time slot in a few short months has been haunted by the short lived " Man Up " ( which premiered to a 2 . 4 rating ) and " Work It " ( 2 . 0 ) . " Cougar Town ' s " 1 . 8 rating is about average for this slot , but that ' s not great considering the two shows that mainly generated that number were cancelled . It ' s lead in , " Last Man Standing , " had 7 . 6 million viewers and a 2 . 0 rating .The numbers follow the show ' s cast and creator Bill Lawrence traveling the country and guerrilla marketing out of " Cougar Town " for the past month . Yesterday , Lawrence told us that he figured the show would return lower , but had hopes for the upcoming weeks ." Here ' s what I really think will happen : I think the show will not premiere as high as people hope , " Lawrence predicted to EW . " And what I hope will happen is what always happened on " Scrubs " when they brought it back . The first week , the numbers are always lower than their predecessor . . . . But what would happen then , as people became educated that the show was back on , each week it would be higher . The next week , the gap would be closed . "Also it should be noted that Valentine ' s Day is pretty lousy for shows in general . Overall TV usage was down 7 . 3 percent last night , according to Nielsen .Meanwhile ABC ' s " The River " ( 5 . 0 million , 1 . 7 ) is getting washed out , falling 29 percent its second week . At 10 p . m . " Body of Proof " ( 6 . 2 million , 1 . 2 ) was soft .No Valentine for Sarah Michelle Gellar : With only a repeat of " Hart of Dixie " for a lead in , " Ringer " ( 1 . 1 million , 0 . 3 ) fell a stunning 40 percent from last week to a series low ( and down 50 percent from its midseason return two weeks ago ) . A 0 . 3 rating is like " Remodeled " and " H8R " territory for The CW .Also Tuesday : CBS won the night with " NCIS " ( 3 . 9 ) , " NCIS : LA " ( 3 . 2 ) and " Unforgettable " ( 2 . 3 ) all down between 3 7 percent . . Fox was second with " Glee " ( 2 . 8 ) down 15 percent , " New Girl " ( 3 . 2 ) down 9 percent and a steady " Raising Hope " ( 2 . 1 ) . NBC was third with " Biggest Loser " ( 2 . 0 ) down 13 percent to a season low and " Parenthood " ( 1 . 6 ) .See the full article at EW . comCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc .

BILLINGSGATE POST : This story may appeal to those who think below the belt . But only for a moment . Allow me to digress .If you wonder who the Whip Woman is , it ' s not that important at least for the moment . The real story is about Lash LaRue . How many of you know the name of his horse ? It ' s important . Obviously , you have heard of Tom Mix and Cement and Bob Steele and Cattle . Cowboy heroes both , these two rode herd on the backs of their respective mounts in the 40 ' s and 50 ' s in many a Saturday matinee thriller .Lash LaRue was different , though . Instead of having a 45 caliber hog leg strapped to his thigh , he carried a bull whip on his saddle horn . He starred in many matinee shit kickers , including King of the Bullwhip and Law of the Lash . Later in his life , he taught Harrison Ford how to use a bullwhip in the Indiana Jones movies . LaRue was one of the first recipients of the Golden Boot Awards in 1983 .There was nothing romantic about Lash , other than his whip , which he used on conniving women who dared to ride his pony . It was said that his faithful mount was named Black Diamond by a cowgirl squeeze he called Chisels because of her cold steel hard body . Because LaRue was as limp as his whip , Chisels named him Lash . His given name was Al . To be sure , Black Diamond was more of a stud than Lash , thus the name .Enough about Lash LaRue . The Whip Woman is a lost 1928 silent film that starred Estelle Taylor and Hedda Hopper . No one really knows who whipped whom , but Loretta Young was in the movie . Perhaps she was ornery enough to merit a good whipping , being fifteen at the time . Nothing out of the ordinary . Spare the whip and spoil the child .Which brings us to the title of the new movie currently being filmed , The Whip Woman Lashes Out At Lash LaRue In this modern day thriller , The Whip Woman is being played by Hillary Rodham Clinton . You guessed it Lash LaRue is being played by the counter whipping Donald Trump .There are no romantic scenes in this movie . The whip lashing heroine is not saved by a gallant Lash LaRue astride a charging Black Diamond . Although his words seem hollow as he speaks of how he cherishes women with due respect , how can the lovable Lash be expected to cherish a card carrying , robotic , gerbil loving troll ?How does this movie play out in the end ? Only the Doctor knows . 	 1

SCOTTSDALE , AZ While attending the lip balm industry ' s largest annual conference , Blistex marketing executive Bernard Ganley committed a number of embarrassing social gaffes , breached several codes of conduct , and generally acted in a manner unbefitting a major lip balm company representative , sources reported Thursday .Ganley , who was sent to the four day conference to launch Blistex ' s new lip moisturizer , first humiliated himself Monday morning when he failed to remember what the signature product was called . By the end of the week , the 62 year old executive had made a dozen more blunders , including walking straight past an important regional wholesaler , stumbling over basic industry terminology , and suggesting that applicator tips were a " thing of the past .

" To say the things he did in front of ChapStick CEO Russell Morton , whose grandfather single handedly built the lip soothing industry it ' s an atrocity . "" Asking if ChapStick ever tried adding mint to its medicated formula , " Porter continued . " Is he out of his godforsaken mind ? "The national symposium , which took place at the Scottsdale Resort and Conference Center , was reportedly almost ruined by Ganley on a number of occasions . According to sources , the thoughtless executive threw away free samples right in front of vendors , asked horrified onlookers the difference between salve and balm , and alienated several Carmex distributors when he noted that the company was still using those " little white jars . "Many claimed the all natural lip care company Burt ' s Bees received the worst of Granley ' s insensitive remarks . Granley failed to recognize Burt ' s Bees CEO John Replogle and then overlooked the senior executive ' s outstretched hand after it was determined that the two of them had met several times before .In addition , Granley offended Replogle when he told him that Burt ' s Bees ' products tasted a lot better than he remembered ." I understand that Blistex is one of the top three lip balm manufacturers in the country , but who does he think he is acting so dismissive ? " said Kiss My Face CFO Crystal Ward . " Burt ' s Bees is established now . You don ' t just brush them off . And you definitely don ' t go up to that table and not talk to Harriet . "" Jesus Christ , " Ward continued . " You just don ' t do that . "Granley ' s competitors were not the only ones to feel the brunt of his inappropriate behavior . On Tuesday , the Blistex executive drew the scorn of his own company after incorrectly referring to its new sheer moisturizing solution as " ointment , " and was nearly fired on the spot later that same day after suggesting that Blistex ' s flagship cherry flavor be discontinued a move many called " unthinkable and highly offensive . "" You can ' t attack cherry flavor and expect to get away with it , " said vice president of Blistex business development Steve Mundle . " This will get back to corporate , it ' ll get out to people . Heads are going to roll . "" This was supposed to be a breakthrough year for Blistex we were supposed to be celebrating , " Mundle added . " Instead . one loose cannon had to destroy everything we worked so hard to build . "Granley reportedly made his worst faux pas on the final night of the symposium , when he invited conventioneers up to his suite for the annual cocaine orgy , only to stand naked in front of the entire room and ask if anyone had brought Vaseline . 	 1
NEW YORK In a familiar sign that spring is just around the corner , animal shelters across the nation announced this week that they have put down the last batch of dogs that were given as Christmas gifts in 2008 ." It ' s that time of year again , " said Darien , CT animal control specialist Erica Tierney , throwing the carcass of yet another 2 year old Labradoodle into an incinerator . " As soon as the weather starts to warm up , we find ourselves administering pentobarbital injections to those final few puppies who were once a welcome Christmas gift , but have since been abandoned by people tired of caring for them . "" Come April , we ' ll have a nice little break , but before you know it , the 2009 puppies will start rolling in and then the whole cycle starts up again , " added Tierney , removing a soiled red bow from the neck of a dead cocker spaniel .Tierney joked with reporters that she could " almost set her watch " by the annual arrival at the shelter of emaciated , flea ridden dogs seized by the county , all of them gifts from two years ago who gradually became less adorable until they were no longer able to elicit the sympathy of their owners .For many Americans , this cycle is simply part of the rhythm of life : The earth lies dormant in winter , a time when children and romantic partners receive puppies as shortsighted holiday gifts , and then in spring the world reawakens as sunny days return , green leaves sprout forth , the mass dog euthanasia hits its peak , and flowers bloom ." Two years ago we bought Lisa a puppy for Christmas , " said Jason Hutton of San Diego , who quietly abandoned his daughter ' s Lhasa apso by the side of a road when he grew weary of family arguments over whose turn it was to feed it . " And there came a point where it just wasn ' t a puppy anymore , you know ? "According to animal control officials , the dogs they are most commonly obliged by mercy to kill are pugs , miniature pinschers , and pit bulls , but the breeds vary as fads and fashions change from year to year ." There must have been a movie with chihuahuas in it a couple years back because half of these little guys are chihuahuas , " said Chicago area veterinary anesthesiologist Leonard Noonan , strapping a gas mask to the muzzle of his 11th small , round headed dog of the day . " But anything ' s better than the huge piles of Great Danes we had to deal with after those Scooby Doo films came out . "While Noonan is busy putting down " whatever isn ' t cute anymore , " the seeds for seasons yet to come have already been planted , with American parents gearing up to hit the puppy mills later this year ." We could adopt a dog right now for free from the shelter , but I ' m saving up to get my son a purebred dachshund from a breeder , " Sandusky , OH area contractor Richard Wilde said of an animal that will eventually be chained to a cinder block in his backyard and left behind when his family moves . " I should have just enough by Christmastime . Well , probably not for heartworm medication and neutering , but Tyler is just going to go nuts when he sees that little puppy . "While animal shelter employees said they were relieved that dog euthanasia season is over , many reported they were already preparing for the massive influx of Easter rabbits that will signal the transition from spring to summer . 	 1

the trial of british mercenary simon mann continued thursday, a day after mann implicated former friend mark thatcher in the alleged plot to overthrow the president of equatorial guinea. simon mann was arrested after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in zimbabwe. mann, a former british army commando, was arrested four years ago in zimbabwe and extradited to equatorial guinea's capital of malabo earlier this year to face trial for the alleged coup. the trial began tuesday and a verdict was expected within days. thatcher, the son of former british prime minister margaret thatcher, was arrested along with mann in 2004. he pleaded guilty in south africa the following year to unwittingly bankrolling the alleged coup plot he escaped jail time by paying a fine. thatcher said he had given 275, 000 toward the charter of a helicopter, which he originally thought was to be used for commercial purposes, but later suspected was to be used by mercenaries. but mann said thatcher knew much more than he claimed, and even helped plan the operation. " he was not just an investor, " mann testified wednesday. " i mean, he came on board completely and he became part of the management team. " excerpts of mann's testimony were broadcast by britain's channel 4 news, which says it has the only camera in the courtroom. thatcher paid 350, 000 in total, mann said. the money paid for an alouette iii helicopter and a king air plane which were to be used in the plot, he said. mann said he brought thatcher to london to meet with lebanese businessman eli calil. mann said he himself met with calil three times in london's chelsea neighborhood and that, during the third meeting, calil requested his services. " he asked me if i would assassinate the president. he also talked about the possibility of a guerrilla war in equatorial guinea, " mann said in the footage broadcast by channel 4. mann testified that he refused both requests, considering them both unethical, but he did agree to help stage a coup an idea which he said foreign governments including spain and the u. s. supported. mann testified that a scout had been sent to the u. s. to gauge the government's reaction to a possible coup. " the opinion in washington, the pentagon, langley, and the oil companies was basically all the same, which was that the situation, the political situation, in equatorial guinea was very unsatisfactory, very dangerous, and that a well conducted change of government would be welcome, " he said. the courtroom did not appear packed, with several of the bright red fabric covered chairs empty. bespectacled mann was dressed in a gray prison outfit, clean shaven, with his hair combed back. channel 4 said mann testified for four hours. he spent the first two standing up but he was " clearly uncomfortable " and suffering from a hernia, so the judge let him sit for the last two hours, the broadcaster said. mann was arrested four years ago after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in zimbabwe. the government of equatorial guinea said the group was on its way to overthrow its president, teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo, but mann said at the time that they were going to guard a diamond mine in the democratic republic of congo. a zimbabwe court convicted mann of trying to buy weapons illegally, and he served four years in jail there before his extradition to equatorial guinea to face charges of leading an abortive coup. britain's foreign office said it was offering consular assistance to mann and a consular representative had visited him in prison to check on his welfare. the british consul from nearby nigeria was attending the start of the trial in a consular capacity, said a foreign office spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. britain has no embassy in equatorial guinea. mann once served in the british army and was later affiliated with the south africa based mercenary firm executive outcomes. the firm described itself on its now defunct web site as a " military advisory service " that had played a " crucial " role in ending two african civil wars. at the end of his testimony wednesday, mann offered an apology. " i would like to say that i am very, very sorry for what i tried to do in 2003 and 2004. i'm very sorry for what i've done, " he said. " i'm also very happy that we failed, that it didn't work, that nothing actually happened. i'm very happy that that is the case. " mann also said that those involved in the plot who had not been prosecuted should now face justice. " i've been in prison for four years, " he said. " i'm not the same man as i was, and that is what i think i think they should all face justice.

LAS VEGAS The Carolina Panthers will go to San Francisco favored by more than a field goal to win the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history .Oddsmakers didn ' t even wait until the Panthers finished off the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday to install them as favorites for the game against the Denver Broncos two weeks from now . At most books in this gambling city , the Panthers were a 4 point pick , though the early line varied , with the over under settling in at 45 ." The public normally bets what they saw last and they liked what they saw in the Panthers , " said Jay Kornegay of the Westgate Las Vegas Super Book . " I think the line will settle in at 4 and stay there until Super Bowl weekend . "Bettors couldn ' t wait to get early action on the game at the Westgate , which posted a line as the third quarter of the Cardinals Panthers game was winding down . The initial line favored Carolina by 5 1 2 points , and was quickly bet down to 4 points ." We had 10 windows open and there was a flurry of activity at those betting windows , " Kornegay said . " All the early money was on Denver . "CBSSports . com ' s Will Brinson reports " it ' s likely a result of Peyton being an underdog in a Super Bowl , with two weeks to rest and looking sharp against New England . "Super Bowl 2016 : Broncos , Panthers ride dominating defenses to title gameAt the South Point sports book , bettors stood 10 deep in front of nine betting windows as the NFC title game ended . Many cashed tickets on the Panthers , then immediately reinvested their winnings with Carolina in the Super Bowl as a 4 point pick ." They ' re cashing with one hand and betting with the other , " said the South Point ' s Jimmy Vaccaro . " It ' s incredible , they ' re just betting non stop . "Vaccaro said the line could settle in quickly at 4 points and stay there through Super Bowl weekend . Most of the money bet on the championship game does not start coming in until the Friday before the game .Based on the action at the South Point , Vaccaro said he expects the record of 119 . 4 million bet in Nevada ' s legal sports books to fall . That record was set two years ago when the Broncos and Seattle Seahawks met in the Meadowlands ." I know today was the highest handle for a Sunday leading into the Super Bowl I ' ve ever seen in my life , " said Vaccaro , who has run sports books in Las Vegas since the 1970s .Carolina ' s run to being favored in the Super Bowl capped a season that surprised some bookies . The Panthers had been 60 1 at some books entering the season , with only nine teams bigger long shots , according to the betting analysis site Pregame . com .CBS rolls out next gen technology for Super Bowl 50Several sports books began accepting bets last week on potential Super Bowl matchups , with Carolina at the time a 3 point pick over Denver . But while Denver barely escaped with a win , Carolina was impressive in blowing out Arizona .Betting on the game itself generates only about half the revenue sports books bring in for the Super Bowl . The rest is in the so called " prop " bets , which have grown greatly in popularity over the years .At the Westgate , Kornegay said he would post some 400 different prop bets later this week for bettors to take a shot at ." The Super Bowl is always going to sell itself no matter who is in it , " Kornegay said . " But this may be the biggest yet .

ST . CLOUD , MN According to 58 year old Charles Van Hise , principal of Harriet Bishop High School and a 26 year veteran of the St . Cloud School District , too much of his staff ' s time is devoted to " problem students " who require special disciplinary or scholastic attention ." It ' s the oldest story in the world , " Van Hise said . " The squeaky wheels get the grease . I have them in here every day . Today it ' s to complain about ' intellectually lazy ' teachers tomorrow , I ' ll bet you anything it ' s the elimination of the arts program . And I swear to you , if I have to break up one more rumble in the hallway , I ' m going to snap . "Van Hise lifted his blinds to reveal a small group of students eating lunch in the courtyard ." Excuse me one moment , " said Van Hise , leaning out his window to address the gathering of students . " That music is not allowed on campus ! Extinguish your incense , please . "Returning to his seat , Van Hise said , " Those honors program students think they own the school . "Harriet Bishop High , which once had one of Minnesota ' s highest rates of physical violence among students , recently turned its record around , reducing in school violence by 22 percent through programs initiated by Van Hise , who has a reputation as a staunch disciplinarian ." These items were confiscated from high school students , believe it or not , " said Van Hise , displaying a cardboard box containing brass knuckles , a Swiss Army knife , and several issues of Daniel Clowes ' Eightball comics . " It goes without saying that the students who brought these items into my school are long gone . "Van Hise credits the success of his program to those teachers who have volunteered to patrol the hallways during their off periods , keeping an eye out for " class cutters and music heads . "" I ' d have time to do that myself I didn ' t spend half my workday addressing the busybody club ' s concern du jour , " Van Hise said . " Every time I turn my back , there ' s another petition on my desk . Look , I have one right now . It ' s the same thing every year . We hold student council elections , the student body selects its leader , and the next day , like clockwork , I have a team of kids in here chewing my ear off about the unfair vote counting practices and . . . I don ' t even know what , to tell you the truth . "Harriet Bishop High narrowly escaped federal discipline last fall , when the student body succeeded in lifting its aggregate standardized test scores out of the danger zone . According to Van Hise , the upsurge occurred " with no help from the bottom feeders . "" We are running a school here . Not a gymnasium . Not a . . . a . . . a . . . roller derby . And certainly not a Model U . N . , " Van Hise said . " I ' ve got the same advice for all of them : Sit down , shut up , and you ' ll be out of here in four years . "That afternoon , strolling the hallways with a bottle of acetone and a rag , Van Hise wiped the words " cock smoker " from his portrait . Later , he paused before a display case devoted to football awards . Taped inside of the case was a poster titled " The Three Pillars of Education . " Two of the columns , labeled " Academics " and " The Arts , " were crumbling . The third , labeled " Sports , " was pristine , reaching to the clouds ." You ' ll notice whoever drew this . . . cartoon . . . didn ' t care to sign his name to it , " said Van Hise , searching his key ring for the display case key . " You tell me : Should we have more people watching over the theater kids while they paint their sets , or should I make sure someone ' s keeping tabs on the school on weekend nights when some kid wants to break in here and vandalize my office ? "" One of them coated my office floor in Vaseline , " Van Hise added . " I nearly busted my head . "Van Hise was not pessimistic in every respect . He reserved his esteem for a certain set of " solid , devoted , quiet minded students . "" Solid , average students who aren ' t causing trouble and aren ' t trying to attract any undue attention to themselves , " Van Hise said . " Your Average Joes and Plain Janes . They ' re the ones who bring our scores up . No question in my mind . The rest just cancel each other out . " 	 1

ROME , Italy A U . N . report says hunger is on the rise globally and blames higher food prices .Populations within conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are particularly vulnerable .The Food and Agriculture Organization has issued preliminary estimates classifying 963 million people as undernourished an increase of 40 million people over the past year ." One out of seven people about 15 percent suffer chronically of not having enough to eat , " said Mark Smulders , an FAO economist .The hunger report titled " The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008 " said the world ' s financial and economic problems could throw more people into poverty .The number of hungry had been increasing over the years before the rise in food prices , with warfare and political instability continuing to be among the factors causing poverty .The preliminary estimates lack a firm country breakdown , but last year ' s figures are an accurate measure of where the problems are .About 907 out of 923 million undernourished people in 2007 , or 65 percent of the hungry , live in India , China , the war wracked Democratic Republic of Congo , Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan and Ethiopia .Smulders said about 27 percent of the world ' s hungry live in India and 15 percent in China . The other countries each represent 4 to 5 percent of the world ' s total .There has been progress in fighting hunger in the Asian nations of Thailand and Vietnam , and in the sub Saharan African nations of Ghana , Republic of Congo , Nigeria , Mozambique and Malawi , the report said .Food prices have declined from their peak earlier in the year , but they are staying high compared to other years , the agency said .

Prices of major cereals have fallen by over 50 percent from their peaks earlier in 2008 but they remain high compared to previous years , " the FAO said .The agency said the " rural and urban poor , landless farmers and female headed households are the worst hit by high food prices .

glendale, az clarifying a common misconception about " two very distinct sports, " bodybuilder glen tuttle extensively explained the difference between bodybuilding and weight training monday. " it's a frequent assumption that weightlifting and bodybuilding are one and the same, " tuttle, 41, told perry sarkes, a sales associate at oshman's, a sporting goods store at arizona mills mall. " but in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. " tuttle, who was at oshman's shopping for a back support belt, was forced to explain the difference to sarkes when the 20 year old employee asked him how long he'd been a weightlifter. tuttle replied that he's been a bodybuilder for more than six years. " bodybuilding emphasizes developing large, well defined, well proportioned muscles, " tuttle said. " in weightlifting, on the other hand, the goal is simply increasing muscular strength. now, weight training, that's something else entirely. weight training builds strength to improve performance in other athletic activities. you're gonna see a lot of basketball and football players doing weight training. " though sarkes had not asked, tuttle went on to explain that it is an individual's goal for his or her body which determines the fitness program that particular individual should choose. " a bodybuilder is looking to achieve a certain overall body image, " said tuttle, who works out approximately 30 hours a week and subscribes to numerous bodybuilding magazines, including flex, ironman, and muscle and fitness. " it's much more than simply upping the weight on your bar. " as sarkes rang up the weider pro series belt and oversized b. u. m. equipment tank top tuttle had picked out, the 1998 npc arizona championships semi finalist explained that bodybuilding competitions are much more " involved " than weightlifting competitions. " in bodybuilding, you don't just walk off with the prize because you lifted the most weight, " tuttle said. " you've got to have 100 percent control over every part of your body, including your brain. you've got to be ripped from head to toe, but you also need a certain mental attitude. " a major part of bodybuilding is what tuttle calls " achieving the bodybuilder ideal " of perfect definition, size, and symmetry. " i've seen a lot of guys with mind blowing quads, but then they totally ignore their traps, " tuttle said. " to be a competition level bodybuilder, you need the complete package. that's not so in weightlifting, where you can easily get away with favoring certain muscle groups over others. " a bodybuilder, tuttle said, must also know how to properly apply skin bronzing agents, oils, and depilatories to emphasize muscle definition while posing onstage. " bodybuilding requires finesse and style, not just brute physical strength, " tuttle said. " schwarzenegger, sergio oliva, frank zane those guys were incredibly strong, but you have to remember that they were also tremendously graceful. and when it came time for the pose down, they really knew how to put on a show. " this is not the first time tuttle has clarified a point regarding bodybuilding. last friday, on the stretching mats at vic tanny, the full service health club he patronizes when powerhouse gym is closed, tuttle educated club member stacey schuitt about the crucial role proper diet plays in bodybuilding. " more than in any other sport, in bodybuilding, eating right is your number one priority, " said tuttle, who lists his favorite foods as broiled salmon and baked potatoes with fat free sour cream. " if you don't put the proper fuel in your engine, your car isn't going to go anywhere. " " i eat a high protein meal one hour before working out and a mixed high protein and potassium rich carb meal one hour after the workout, " tuttle told schuitt. " then i take a creatine monohydrate supplement if it's an arm day, or a 32 ounce twin lab amino fuel shake if i'm doing legs. you probably don't have to worry about that, though, if you're just looking to lose weight. still, a good antioxidant wouldn't hurt. " as tuttle recently told food lion checkout clerk josh calhoun, the rewards of bodybuilding are well worth the tremendous work and dedication the sport demands. " i'm developing every muscle in my body, from pecs to glutes to hammies, " tuttle said. " why devote yourself to a sport that doesn't demand perfection from every inch of you? when i use my body, i want to go all 	 1
Onscreen Prof . Snape , British actor Alan Rickman deadBritish film , TV and stage actor Alan Rickman , who carved out a niche for himself with his distinctive screen presence and voice and was best known for playing Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter film series and ruthless terrorist Hans Gruber in " Die Hard " , died here on Thursday , his family announced . He was 69 ." The actor and director Alan Rickman has died from cancer at the age of 69 . He was surrounded by family and friends , " said a statement released by his family , reported BBC .Born on February 21 , 1946 in a working class family , Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman became interested in drama while attending upper school and trained in art and graphic design before securing a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1972 where he honed his talent .His first major role was as the impetuous Tybalt in a BBC TV adaptation of " Romeo and Juliet " ( 1978 ) but came to viewers ' attention with his brief appearance in the BBC adaptation of John le Carre ' s " Smiley ' s People " ( 1982 ) with Alec Guinness and then as the odious , smarmy Reverend Obadiah Slope in the channel adaptation of Anthony Trollope ' s ecclesiastical series " Barchester Towers " ( 1982 ) .What took his career upward was his villainous part as the German terrorist in the high octane action thriller " Die Hard " ( 1988 ) opposite Bruce Willis ( a role he reprised in a flashback as " Die Hard with a Vengeance " , 1995 ) , as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham in Kevin Costner starrer " Robin Hood , Prince of Thieves " ( 1991 ) and then as Hogwarts ' apparently malevolent potions master who ceaselessly targets the boy wizard and his friends .Playing Snape with barely repressed , sarcastic menace , Rickman appeared in all seven films of the series from " Harry Potter and the Philosopher ' s Stone " ( 2001 ) to " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II " ( 2011 ) .But he was not always the bad ( or the apparent bad ) onscreen with roles like the controversial German physician Franz Anton Mesmer in " Mesmer " ( 1994 ) , Col . Brandon , who romances the younger sister ( Kate Winslet ) in Ang Lee ' s adaptation of Jane Austen ' s " Sense and Sensibility " ( 1995 ) , iconic Irish leader Eamon De Valera in " Michael Collins " ( 1996 ) and ' Sun King ' Louis XIV in his own directed " A Little Chaos " ( 2015 ) .His distinctive voice was used for Marvin the Paranoid Android in a 2005 adaptation of Douglas Adams ' cult classic " The Hitchhiker ' s Guide to the Galaxy " and as the Caterpillar in Tim Burton ' s " Alice in Wonderland " ( 2010 ) .A recipient of the BAFTA , Golden Globe , Emmy and Screen Actors Guild Awards , he is survived by his spouse Rima Horton with whom he had been living together since 1977 and married in 2012 . 	 0
Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders , fresh off their debate Sunday night in Charleston , S . C . , will remain in the Palmetto State Monday to celebrate Martin Luther King , Jr . , Day with local leaders and activists .Civic leaders , activists , and the three Democratic 2016 presidential candidates are celebrating , marching and paying homage Monday to Martin Luther King Jr . , marking the 30th anniversary of the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader .In South Carolina , civil rights leaders planned a march to their state capitol as in past years when their rally highlighted calls to remove the Confederate flag from Statehouse grounds .The King Day at the Dome gathering began in 2000 with that call . Last July , organizers got their wish as South Carolina swiftly removed the flag which had flown at the capitol for more than 50 years after what police said was a racially motivated shooting that claimed nine lives at a church in Charleston .The state NAACP said there is still more work to do to honor King and the theme of this year s rally is education equity , with speakers calling for South Carolina to spend more money to help students in poorer , more rural school districts , which frequently have a majority of black students .And this year s event will also include appearances by all three main Democratic presidential candidates ? Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders and Martin O Malley .View Gallery Martin Luther King Jr . ' s inspirational quotes that resonate todayThe rally in Columbia is one of many planned nationwide recalling the legacy of King , who was assassinated in 1968 .In the nation s capital , President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama planned to take part in a community service program in King s honor . Attorney General Loretta Lynch was to be the keynote speaker at a National Action Network King Day Awards program and FBI Director James Comey planned to lead a government wreath laying service at the Martin Luther King Jr . memorial in Washington .Elsewhere , the King Center in Atlanta was set to celebrate the holiday with a remembrance ceremony at Ebenezer Baptist Church . That commemoration caps more than a week of events meant to celebrate the slain civil rights icon s legacy under the theme : Remember ! Celebrate ! Act ! King s Legacy of Freedom for Our World .What most people around the world want , whatever nation they live in , is the freedom to participate in government , the freedom to prosper in life and the freedom to peacefully coexist , said King s daughter , the Rev . Bernice King . 	 0
Boca Raton , FL TV executives from the SyFy Channel are excited after receiving great ratings for the latest Sharknado offering and have already announced a new project , Slothicane !According to early reports , the plot for Slothicane will follow similar plot themes from the Sharknado series . The main plot theme will remain that the incident is caused by global warming .Due to changes in the world ' s climate , due to warming , weather patterns will change in a way that will cause sloths to be sucked out of their trees in rainforests and pushed slowly through the oceans of the world to even more slowly wreak havoc on the human race .While Sharknado played on viewers ' fear of sharks and the suddenness of a shark coming out of nowhere to gobble up unsuspecting victims , Slothicane will play out much slower and will rely on pulling the viewer in for the long haul by the emotion in the faces of the expressive sloths .Some differences between the shows : Sharknado was aired each time in one night . Slothicane will be aired over three weeks since every aspect of the storm moves as slow as a sloth .Sharknado was filled with blood and terror . Slothicane will have no bloodshed , although a boy in the film suffers a scrape on his arm from a sloth claw , and victims will have two months to prepare for the storm once they find out about it .Additionally , in Slothicane , once the storm moves on shore and the sloths are unleashed , potential victims will be able to stroll down the street , stop off at a Starbucks , hang out with some friends for a while , and continue on their way without the sloths catching up to them .Have we mentioned how f cking slow these sloths are ? Yeah , it ' s crazy . But SyFy thinks they have another hit on their hands . They think after the first two Sharknado films the public might need a breather .Already writers for the network are kicking around ideas for Slothalanche , ThunderSloth , and Slothquake , a slow , deliberate , gentle moving of the tectonic plates that takes forever but causes no real damage . Al Gore will direct . 	 1
THE SERENGETI According to a male lion currently dying on the Serengeti Plain , his agonizing demise certainly doesn ' t seem as though it ' s part of some transcendent cosmic circle of life , but rather as if he ' s slowly and painfully bleeding to death .The expiring lion , who dragged his weakened body onto an isolated patch of grassland Monday after being mortally wounded by a poacher , confirmed to reporters that he is not experiencing a tranquil , satisfying sense of harmony with the universe , but is instead mainly feeling intense physical torment brought on by a fatal wound to the abdomen ." I could be wrong , and maybe this is all an enchanting and noble chapter in life ' s great cosmic narrative , but right now it pretty much just feels like I ' m dying alone on the ground in a puddle of my own blood , " said the 500 pound big cat , releasing a deep moan as violent spasms seized his body . " Shouldn ' t I be feeling a stirring sensation of kinship with all living creatures or something ? Yeah , I ' m not getting any of that . "" Plus , I was illegally shot by a poacher . How does that fit into this ancient , majestic cycle in which all of nature is connected as a unified being ? " the lion added .Observing his surroundings , the moribund lion reported that he has seen no brilliant gleaming light shining down from the heavens that makes him realize he ' s part of a sacred tradition as old as life itself , nor has a hush seemed to fall over the land in a reverent acknowledgment of his passing .In addition , the large African mammal noted that succumbing to a gunshot wound hasn ' t resulted in a spiritual awakening in which he suddenly feels at one with the universe , so much as it has made him feel terrified , alone , and utterly insignificant .The lion also reported that he has heard no triumphant string music backed by thundering tribal drums swelling all around him , but rather only the sound of flies buzzing around his soon to be lifeless body ." I guess I thought there ' d be a choir of chanting , melodic voices , and that all the animals of the African valley would gather on a distant ridge to respectfully view my last moments and recognize our essential interconnectedness , " said the lion , drawing his last labored breaths . " But there ' s nobody else around at all , except those vultures . "Added the lion , " Am I supposed to feel pride and great dignity knowing that my body will decay and a bunch of birds will eagerly tear into my rotting flesh with their beaks ? "As he closes his eyes for the final time before yielding to one last series of convulsions , the lion is reportedly pondering whether shitting all over himself really played any role at all in some vast , beautiful , and endless saga of life , death , and rebirth . 	 1
Jeopardy ! has been around since 1984 , with 25 million regular viewers who try their best to shout out their own responses to the clues before the contestants . We marvel at Jeopardy ! superstars like Ken Jennings , who held the champion spot for an incredible 74 games in a row .Jeopardy ! also hosts a variety of special tournaments , like the Teen and the Teacher ' s Tournaments . We can all applaud the eleven year old , during Kid ' s Week , who knows the capitol of some obscure Pacific island that most of us never new existed . And even though the game show has to simplify the clues for the contestants during Celebrity Week , viewers don ' t mind because the prize monies go to charity , right ?But the latest iteration of Jeopardy had some problems . The Political Tournament was to feature rising and prominent politicians in an altruistic effort by the producers to expand the political consciousness of their TV audience and , hopefully , to encourage more to the public to vote in national elections .The first three contestants were presidential candidate and neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , and Texas Senator Ted Cruz . The genial and always immaculately attired host , Alex Trebec , introduced the contestants and was clearly excited to begin this new segment .Mr Trebec never falters and is never at a loss for words , but when Dr Carson responded to a clue by saying that " . . . people go into prison straight and when they come out , they ' re gay " , Mr Trebec seemed to wilt . He gaped , open mouthed , for ten seconds before regaining his inimitable sense of composure and introducing the next clue . Then , responding to the next clue concerning President Obama ' s life history , Governor Huckabee said that Obama grew up " in Kenya " . Mr Trebec blinked , ran his fingers through his hair ( upsetting his perfect coif ) , and loosened the knot of his tie ( which was matched perfectly with his shirt and jacket , as per usual ) .The third clue to be offered up related to recent congressional history . Senator Cruz rang in first and informed us all that Obama and Harry Reid were responsible for the disastrous government shut down in 2013 . At this , Alex Trebec put his head down on the podium and wept .Mr Trebec was unable to continue the program and had to be led off the stage . The contestants attempted to continue the show by themselves , but persistent booing by the studio audience caused the producers to pull the plug .The producers cancelled the special tournament without comment and announced that Jeopardy ! would resume its usual schedule as soon as Mr Trebec has recovered his equanimity , which is expected to take no longer than 6 or 7 weeks . 	 1
Nottingham , UK : In a bizarre incident today an ageing gentleman was arrested at the German supermarket , Lidl , in Nottingham . It seems he was acting like a loony and could not contain himself whilst laughing his bald head off very loudly !Other English customers found it quite amusing to see a laughing and smiling face at Lidl , because normally they are confronted with stone faces who have been taught to do it the German way .Whilst waiting to pay for his veg and slightly rotting fruit , the man , who is not in posession of particularly good health , was laughing all the way to the till and this was too much for the Lidl personnel , so they phoned for the police to come and arrest this very strange gentleman .A Lidl spokeswoman , Frau Helga Hess Ler ( no relation ) gave the following statement to the local press :" Ve do everything to please our British clients , ve do not smile , ve serve zem nearly rotten fruit and veg on ze cheap vizout labels but zis Mein Herr is just too much , laughing out loud in a German supermarket , nein , bitte ! "The man , Gerry ( appropriate ) Hinchclock ( named changed for legal reasons ) , was last seen desperately holding on to a strange book called EQ whilst being carried out of Lidl horizontally by 4 beefy policewomen kicking his legs and screaming : " I love Volga Olga and you bastards will never stop me ! "Lidl , have in ze meantime , promised zheir British clients zat zey vill not take zings quite so seriously in ze future and tell zem ze origins of zheir fruit and veg !

WASHINGTON Saying the nation must face the " grave realities " of its mounting debt , President Barack Obama unveiled a deficit reduction plan Wednesday that included far reaching spending cuts , pulling off a daring robbery of the heavily fortified Fort Knox bullion deposi tory , and repealing Bush era tax cuts for the wealthy .In a televised address , Obama outlined his proposal to eliminate 4 trillion from the federal deficit over the next 12 years , and expressed his vision for a future in which the government was leaner , more efficient , and had billions and billions of dollars worth of stolen gold stashed in D . C . area safe deposit boxes ." We cannot continue to live beyond our means , " the president said . " Unless we want to cripple our grandchildren with this debt burden , we must act now by eliminating tax loopholes and pulling off what all Americans Republicans and Democrats alike can agree is the greatest heist of all time . "" It ' s time to stop kicking the can down the road to future generations , " Obama added . " We must empty that vault and ensure our country ' s full economic recovery . "According to a fact sheet issued by the White House , the proposed measures include slashing farm subsidies , cutting federal pension insurance , tricking Fort Knox security personnel into thinking that the president and five others are ordinary elevator repairmen , capping Medicaid ' s outlays on equipment , shaping C4 charges to blast 21 inch thick vault doors off their hinges , and curbing discretionary spending .In spite of the admittedly " formidable " challenges that his plan faced , Obama insisted that " the time for action is now , " noting that last week the price of gold rose above 1 , 500 an ounce for the first time ever ." Reining in the runaway growth of entitlement programs and the defense budget will not be easy , " Obama said . " And neither will silently ferrying 5 , 000 tons of bullion through a network of ventilation ducts . But just trust me on this I ' ve got the blueprints and I think I found a way out through a drainage pipe . "According to Obama ' s senior adviser David Plouffe , the president ' s plan will assure the nation ' s long term solvency while also producing immediate tangible benefits , including , but not limited to , a gigantic pile of gold ." The president looked at every conceivable option , " said Plouffe , who is expected to externally coordinate the six man Fort Knox team from a van outfitted with multiple video screens . " He considered trimming the federal workforce , scaling back welfare payments , taking out a 4 trillion fire insurance policy on the Pentagon and burning it to the ground , even raising the retirement age everything was on the table . "" Ultimately , the president selected measures that will have a minimal impact on the middle class , " Plouffe continued . " Indeed , his plan places an added burden only on those who either earn more than 250 , 000 annually or house 368 , 000 bars of pure gold . Most Americans won ' t be affected at all . "Republican leaders were quick to unleash a barrage of criticism , blasting the administration ' s proposal for its " unacceptable " reliance on tax increases and grand larceny , and accusing Obama of offering few concrete details in his speech ." The president conveniently avoided any specifics on his Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board and his getaway plan , " House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R WI ) said . " And his speech contained not one mention of those laser beam motion detectors that you can ' t even see unless you have an aerosol spray that makes them visible . What about those , Mr President ? "In a party line vote earlier this month , the House of Representatives passed Rep . Ryan ' s rival plan , which includes across the board tax cuts , tunneling under the Bureau of Printing and Engraving , sending an electrical surge through its security system , and stealing the engraving plates so that " we can print off as much money as we want .

rapid city, sd saying that he always strives to set a strong example for his son to follow, local father gary dalton told reporters tuesday that he has been carefully teaching his 9 year old boy zachary how to overreact with blind rage to completely irrelevant bullshit. " now that zach's getting older, it's important for me to show him how to deal with the minor inconveniences in life by blowing them totally out of proportion, " said dalton, noting that he frequently tries to demonstrate to his son the proper way to fly off the handle both at home and in public. " zach should know that small, trivial irritations, like misplaced keys or having to relight the pilot light in the basement, should trigger an unbridled anger inside him. and that's not something he can fully learn from his friends at school or by watching tv he needs a father figure right there, blowing up in his face about never, ever messing with the dvr again for him to see exactly how it's done. " " it's up to me as a parent to become unsettlingly irate over something as small as letting the screen door slam shut, so that zach learns to never let even the most petty, negligible nuisance slide, " dalton added. " he's an observant kid and he really looks up to me, so i'm sure he'll catch on quickly. " in an effort to help guide his son's development, dalton explained that he consistently tries to embody the qualities of irritability, hostility, and bitterness in his daily life, emphasizing to his fourth grade son the importance of letting his annoyance over an inconsequential matter develop into a lingering, biting resentment that makes others feel uncomfortable to be near him. in addition, the 42 year old market researcher said that he has been making a concerted effort of late to show his boy how to obsess over such ultimately trifling things as a driver going too slow in the left lane or a person who is slightly holding up a line, and to interpret these incidents as if they were significant, deliberate personal slights. dalton told reporters that he believes he's made significant headway with his son in recent weeks. in particular, the local father cited several " very constructive " instances in which he demonstrated how to absolutely flip out when someone asks him to pull the car over to use the bathroom when to pound his fist on a table and mutter the phrases " goddammit " and " i don't need this " in increasingly loud and aggressive tones and the proper way to scowl, roll his eyes, and pantomime hurling his cell phone violently to the floor when his wife calls to tell him that something came up and he'll have to drive the children to their soccer game. " i always try to lead by example, but now, when some meaningless little thing doesn't go zach's way, i'll help guide him through the process of treating it as if it were the end of the world, " said dalton, noting how his own father instructed him how to fly into a rage over barely anything at all when he was a child. " just last weekend, when a waitress brought him the wrong item, i laid out the process of having a public meltdown step by step, showing him exactly how to get irrationally livid, how to clench his teeth and curse under his breath, and then how to belittle a stranger's intelligence in a loud, confrontational scene that causes others to look over in shock and disgust. i think it really made a strong impression on him. " the local father told reporters that he was particularly looking forward to an upcoming family camping trip, claiming that a single explosive outburst in such close quarters would " go a long way " toward helping his son understand how to generalize a small frustration into a broad, unrestrained sense of anger that simmers for days and effectively ruins the whole family's entire weekend. dalton reported, however, that he feels he's able to get through to his son most clearly when he and zach spend time alone together. " when it's just me and zach, i can really show him up close how enraged he should become over the unimportant things in life, " said dalton, highlighting recent instructive one on one interactions in which he lashed out at his son for talking during a tv show and for touching the thermostat. " my hope is that, one day, zach will be able to show his own son how to completely freak out at the slightest provocation and then snap at his wife and children. " " these are important life skills i'm passing down to zach, which he'll be able to use nearly every day as he gets older, " dalton continued. " and i really look forward to watching him grow into the 	 1
The Incredible Hulk abruptly came out as gay leaving a sudden , gaping hole in the GOP ' s anti gay agenda . " Hulk SMASH closet ! " said the huge , green monster , sporting a smug grin and semi erection as he crashed to the ground with a " THOOMP ! ! " and broke up an anti gay rally in South Carolina . " Holy crap ! I hope he doesn ' t fancy me ! " republican Senator Lindsay Graham screamed like a little girl as he rushed out of the area shielding his butt with his hands like a delicate flower .Clearing his throat , The Incredible Hulk clarified his political position . " Sorry for the noisy manifestation surrounding my arrival , but it ' s kind of hard to get leg room on commercial flights these days . I just want to reasonably convince those opponents to same sex marriage that the love of two people does not diminish the foundation of marriage in any way . Could you see it in your hearts to cease this hurtful battle of matrimonial exclusion ? " he asked softly .The crowd sighed in unison and Speaker John Boehner was observed sobbing quietly . . . again . Even Rand Paul seemed genuinely moved by the Green Giant ' s heartfelt words until Ted Cruz tried to capitalize on the moment with a hand on his ass ." What the . . . ? Don ' t touch me , man ! " Paul barked , causing Cruz to cower back into the shadows with a feral hiss . As the crowd moved slowly towards the formerly fearful spectacle that was The Hulk , reconciliation was in the air . Then along came Palin ." I don ' t like green eggs and ham ! " she sneered . " I do not like them , BAM A LAM ! " She felt a hand on her shoulder . " Careful , " whispered Mitch McConnell from behind a rock . " If he decides to go all teabag on your crazy ass , those green eggs will make pulp out of what ' s left of your brain ! And I can ' t imagine what he might do with with that ham ! " But Palin would not be deterred ." I ' m not afraid of this big green monkey ! " she said defiantly . " I ' ve got the Fantastic Four backing me up . The Thing is hung even better , plus he ' s ribbed for my pleasure ! " she bragged . " The Hulk doesn ' t look that incredible to me . More like The Mediocre Hulk from where I ' m standing ! Just like O BAM a ' s health care plan ! " And that ' s when the fight started .The Hulk was joined by Thor ' s " sensitive " brother Loki and even Captain America , who while not gay issued the challenge , " Call me a butt pirate , futermukers , and see what you get ! " In an epic comic book showdown , they squared off against the Fantastic Four joined by Dr Strange fighting for polygamy rights , " just not the gay kind " . As the mortals ran for the hills , super heroes and villains alike realigned themselves according to sexual orientation . The battle lasted for days , destroying most of the state which was intellectually running on fumes anyway . Ironman Tony Stark took no side since he was just there to watch .Ironically , in the destructive aftermath no clear winner was apparent . No traces of Sarah Palin or The Incredible Hulk were found , either .Fast forward several years and they will be discovered by a wayward explorer who happens upon Palin and The Hulk living in relative seclusion as a couple in a remote part of Alaska . Sure , their politics occasionally clash , but The Hulk will take it all in stride , incredibly without losing his temper . When asked about the key to his heterosexual happiness with such a notorious shrew , The Hulk will remark , " Well , you have to admit . . . she ' s really got a mouth on her ! Hulk BUH DUMP BUMP !

Kerry urges Syrian peace talks to continue despite attackWASHINGTON : US Secretary of State John Kerry appealed on Sunday to both sides to continue Syrian peace talks in Geneva despite an attack by Islamic State bombers that killed more than 60 people near the country ' s holiest Shia shrine .Kerry said the conflict could easily engulf the Middle East if no negotiated settlement was achieved .He also called for immediate steps by all the parties to increase food aid and other humanitarian assistance to 13 . 5 million Syrians , including 6 million children ." In the end there is no military solution to the conflict , " Kerry said in a televised statement .Kerry ' s statement came after a senior negotiator for the Syrian opposition delegation threatened to walk out of the talks if President Bashar al Assad ' s forces and allies continued to escalate a bombing campaign in rebel held areas and hamper delivery of humanitarian aid .Since the beginning of 2015 , the Syrian government approved only 13 of 113 requests made by the United Nations to deliver humanitarian aid , Kerry said . And only one in 100 Syrians had received any food aid at all in 2015 ." Let me be clear : The Syrian regime has a fundamental responsibility all the parties to the conflict have a duty to facilitate humanitarian access to populations in desperate need . . . Right now , today , " he said .Preventing food supplies from getting to those in need by planting land mines , erecting barbed wire barriers , or other means was an " intentional tactic of ' surrender or starve , ' that was in direct violation of the law of war , Kerry said .Kerry urged the parties to work toward measurable progress on agreeing a ceasefire , increasing humanitarian assistance and developing a political transition plan as outlined in a Security Council resolution approved last month .He said reaching a negotiated political settlement in Syrian would also undercut support for Islamic State militants across the region . 	 0
washington, dc during a speech monday, president bush disclosed for the first time the pivotal role the 1984 science fiction adventure film the last starfighter played in his decision to enter politics. " my whole life, i'd grown up around politics, but it wasn't until that fateful day in 1984, at a matinee screening of the last starfighter at the old orpheum theater in midland, tx, that i finally realized that my destiny lay in public service, " said bush, speaking at a republican national committee fundraiser at the washington hilton. " the movie showed me that no matter who you are and where you come from, you can make a big difference. " the comments surprised the estimated 600 rnc members in attendance, as well as bush's aides, who expected the president to discuss his proposed tax cut and plan for governing post war iraq. not even his closest advisors knew of bush's passion for the reagan era space epic. straying from his scripted remarks, bush described at length his " lost " years of the early 1980s in midland. " i was holding down two jobs, one at an oil well, the other for a third rate professional baseball team, " bush said. " i had gotten a local girl pregnant, and i spent my weekends watching golf on tv and drinking with my buddies. my dad was vice president then, and occasionally he'd offer me some vice presidential stuff to do, you know, just to get a taste for politics. but i was too distracted by other things. basically, i was your typical unfocused kid. " one idle saturday, bush said he purchased a ticket to a matinee showing of the last starfighter. the seemingly inconsequential act would have profound repercussions on the young man and, ultimately, on the entire nation. " just minutes into the film, i found myself relating deeply to alex, the lead character played by lance guest, " bush said. " he lived in a trailer park and had little opportunity to advance himself. his only escape was playing video games. " after achieving a record score on a video game called " starfighter, " alex is contacted by a mysterious man who invented the game. the man, named centauri, proves to be a space alien whose home planet, rylos, is under impending attack by a sinister invasion force known as the ko dan armada. centauri had invented the game as a means to recruit standout video gamers who could pilot the real life versions of the gunstar spaceships featured in the game. bush was enthralled. " here's this kid, with nothing going on in his life, and it turns out that his only talent, one that seemed so trivial and ridiculous, could alter the fate of the galaxy forever, " bush said. " that really inspired me. " bush said he could also identify with alex's initial reluctance to becoming a starfighter. " at first, alex didn't want to do it, " bush said. " he figured, why should he fight for the star league and risk his life battling an enemy he knew nothing about? but then, when the other starfighters were killed in an attack on their base and evil emperor zur sent his vicious zan do zan assassins to earth to kill him, alex began to realize that the only thing standing between the ko dan and universal conquest was himself. " continued bush : " i realized that if alex turned down the chance to be a starfighter, he would have been assassinated, and earth would have been destroyed. it made me think long and hard about my own place in the world : was i making the right decisions? was i helping people as much as i could? was i missing out on a chance to save mankind? " bush added that he loved the film's breakthrough computer generated special effects, as well as the fact that alex had a robot double something he had dreamed of having in his youth. transfixed by the film, bush would go on to see it seven times that summer, memorizing its dialogue and buying a vhs copy on the day of its release. but the last starfighter's most profound impact on bush was the way it motivated him to leave the private sector and enter politics. " it made me realize that politics truly was in my blood, " bush said. " who cares if i wasn't a good businessman or a sharp scholar? alex was even worse off than me, and look what he achieved. " bush admitted that, while running for texas governor in 1994, he kept his last starfighter videocassette cued up in his campaign bus'vcr, ready for rewinding or fast forwarding to his favorite scenes on a moment's notice. " when my spirits were sagging, i'd watch the scene where alex tells centauri that he's just'a 	 1

( AP ) With just two weeks to go before the first votes of the 2016 race for president , Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders engaged in their most contentious debate match up to date , underscoring their tightening primary race as the Iowa caucuses draw near .The pair tangled repeatedly Sunday night over who s tougher on gun control and Wall Street and how to shape the future of health care in America .Their heated rhetoric highlighted the central question fueling the increasingly competitive primary race : Will the Sanders passion beat out the Clinton practicality ?While Clinton remains the national front runner , grassroots enthusiasm for Sanders outsider candidacy and his unapologetically liberal message has imperiled her lead in Iowa and expanded his advantage in New Hampshire .What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward , Sanders said as he responded to Clinton s argument that his health care plans would reignite a divisive political battle . It s whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies .Clinton derided as impractical Sanders ambitious aim to replace the country s existing employer based system of health care insurance with one in which the government becomes a single payer , providing coverage to all .Instead , she urged a less sweeping action to build on President Barack Obama s health care law by working to further reduce out of pocket costs and control spending on prescription drugs .We have the Affordable Care Act , she said . That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama , of the Democratic Party , and of our country .In doing so , she again cast herself as the natural successor to Obama and accused Sanders , until recently an independent , of being an unfaithful ally of the administration .It s a strategy aimed at locking down Democratic primary voters , particularly minorities , who make up a huge swath of the party s base and remain devoted to Obama . But it s a riskier approach in a general election , where as her party s nominee , Clinton would have to woo voters who question whether they feel more economically secure after Obama s eight years in office .Sanders dismissed the idea that he d endanger Obama s hard won victories , insisting : No one is tearing this up . We re going to go forward .Clinton also rapped Sanders for voting repeatedly with the National Rifle Association while in Congress , welcoming his weekend reversal to support legislation that would deny gun manufacturers legal immunity . She rattled off a list of provisions that she said Sanders had supported in line with the NRA .Sanders , in turn , said Clinton s assertions were very disingenuous and pointed to his lifetime rating of a D from the NRA .The debate over gun control took on a special importance given the event was just blocks from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church , where nine parishioners were killed during Bible study last summer . Clinton has made the issue a central theme of her campaign , citing it as one of the major differences between the candidates .The two tangled over financial policy , too , with Sanders suggesting Clinton won t be tough enough on Wall Street given the big contributions and speaking fees she s accepted from the nation s financial firms . 	 0
It has come to light that many Canberrans are outraged at the ACT governments parking ticket saga claiming it is only a blatant profit driven revenue approach and are refusing to pay them . In a shock finding a third of these bunch of mandarins ( local lingo for mindless clones ) have failed to pay parking fines .To counter this outrageous non conformance the recently appointed " Parking Czar " , whose sole role was to increase revenue by all Machiavellian means possible has targeted debt collection and petty technical non conformance ' s as a winning revenue enhancement strategy .He is also using satellite surveillance to see which streets he can make pay for parking in front of their house . When asked was it actually legal to spy on ordinary citizens he replied that it was the most cost effective means of reaching his bonus thresholds and the policy had been sanctioned by the highest levels of government ." These people think just because they have lived there for generations that entitles them to free parking in front of their house " , the Parking Czar boasted .In a bizarre development he is asking local government to change legislation make it illegal to park in your private garage without a government permit , which he said will only cost a nominal 14 , 560 per year . He said it was important that he reach his internal targets as his bonuses depended on it and he would let nothing stand in the way of his career prospects .Despite the outrage from the public the ACT legislator is shoving the bill through for increased unpaid fine collection powers includingSeizure of your car for fire sale by the govtSeizure of any other personal property that is easy to resell on e baySeizure of youngest child to be held in captivity until fines paidIncarceration of unpaid fines owners CatsPotential 5 year jail sentence for protesting against the seizures10 year jail term for portraying the govt as mean and nastyThe Parking Czar who has a permanent penthouse office , free luxury car and free parking spot at the expense of the taxpayers , is unconcerned about public complaints as he said they are all a pack of whingers and i can park OK and this role is really great for my career , so i can ' t see any problem . Further he " warned disabled drivers they were a target given they thought they could park anywhere just because the had a bit of a limp " , he said with a scoff while sucking on a beer at lunch time .When informed that this behaviour resembled more like fascism than a democracy they replied " it is our policy to not discuss policy or the details of any operation that may or may not be ongoing at this time , we will not expose any current investigations as when the public find out , terrorists everywhere win and innocent lives are put at risk , and further we are unable to confirm or deny that boat refugees were throwing their parking tickets overboard , but it sure seemed that way " . 	 1

None of this guarantees success , and only time and performance can measure how good McAdoo will be . But when you re trying to project whether a young coach can succeed , you see the right traits in McAdoo . Knowing what he wants his team to be . A no nonsense , straightforward style , with mentors Coughlin and Packers coach Mike McCarthy as excellent role models . And a personality that can withstand the highs and lows of an NFL season and the pressure of an unrelentingly demanding market .McAdoo would do well if he took some of the lessons Coughlin taught and made them his own . McAdoo is not media savvy and he will not win the press conference , as McCarthy likes to say . But that s not who you want to run your football team . You want a guy who s more Coughlin than Rex Ryan , and McAdoo will make his news on the field , not at the podium .Manning is clearly the biggest beneficiary of McAdoo s ascension , and he should do as well or even better than his last two seasons , the best statistical stretch of his career . He had 66 touchdown passes and 28 interceptions in that span , and although he made some costly mistakes , he dramatically reduced his turnovers .I m excited to work with him and grow within this offense and get this organization back where it needs to be , Manning said .Bob GlauberGlauber : McAdoo is right choice for GiantsMara and Tisch know this decision is about more than just making Manning comfortable , because they hope McAdoo will be here long enough to groom Eli s heir apparent , whoever that might be . But the confluence of factors leading up to McAdoo s getting the job worked out perfectly for the greatest quarterback in franchise history . If you can maintain continuity and believe in your next coach , then the McAdoo hire makes sense .Again , it doesn t guarantee this will be as good as the Coughlin Manning era , which produced two Super Bowl championships . But it s certainly a promising start for the quarterback and his new coach .Subscribe to Newsday s sports newsletter for stories , photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events . 	 0

PLYMOUTH , NH Evan Riedel has made reference to his Sept . 6 Scrabble victory over girlfriend Amy Vanderploeg " about 200 friggin ' times " in the days since , Vanderploeg reported Monday ." Evan will not let that Scrabble game drop , " Vanderploeg , 23 , said . " Constantly , he ' ll say stuff like , ' Do you need help reading that magazine article ? I know your vocabulary isn ' t the best , judging from that round of Scrabble we played . ' Give it up already , Evan . "The oft alluded to match , which took place at Vanderploeg ' s apartment , was a decisive 382 183 victory for Riedel , who needed less than one hour to dispense with his girlfriend of three years . Upon winning , he performed a brief victory dance and began verbally taunting his vanquished opponent behavior that has continued unabated nearly two weeks later ." He works the word ' esteemed ' into conversation whenever possible and then says , ' Gee , I really like that word ' esteemed , ' " Vanderploeg said . " He was so proud that he ' d used up those four e ' s in one word and used all seven tiles . "Vanderploeg added that by placing " esteemed " across a triple word score spot on the board and earning a 50 point bonus for using all his letters , Riedel was able to , in his words , " rack up a sweet 77 " on the turn .In addition to constantly bringing up his best moves , Riedel has relished pointing out errors Vanderploeg made during the game ." Whenever we see a cat now , he goes , ' C A T . . . Cat ! ' as a way of making fun of me for putting down such a simple word at one point , " Vanderploeg said . " Then he usually says , ' You know where cats like to walk ? On the catwalk ! ' That ' s because instead of putting down ' cat , ' I could ' ve added my ' cat ' onto the word ' walk ' that was already on the board and gotten a lot more points . "Vanderploeg said she should have anticipated Riedel ' s post victory arrogance on the basis of his behavior during the game . " Evan was getting way too into it , " she said . " At one point , he got a double word score and actually screamed , ' Boo ya ! ' ' 'By the midpoint of the game , Riedel had developed an elaborate tile picking ritual , shaking the bag vigorously before blowing into it and chanting , " Come on , come on , please . . . gimme the Xs , Js , and Zs ! " According to Vanderploeg , such theatrics made it difficult for her to concentrate on the game and contributed to her poor showing ." There were several times when I put down the first thing I thought of , just to get the stupid thing over with faster , " Vanderploeg said . " Every time it was my turn , Evan would lean across the board and stare at me . It started to get really annoying , but whenever I told him to stop , he ' d say , ' What ' s the matter ? Can ' t take the heat ? ' "According to noted psychologist Dr Eli Wasserbaum , Riedel ' s behavior is rooted in his outsider status during childhood ." Awkward and ungainly as a boy , Evan never excelled in athletics , " Wasserbaum said . " He did , however , find shelter in academia . It is natural , then , that he is most comfortable asserting his male competitive instincts in this arena . His frequent allusion to the Scrabble victory can be likened to a male peacock extending his colorful tail plumage before the female bird . With his constant boasting , Evan is not actually trying to annoy his girlfriend but instead impress her and win her approval . "Riedel has engaged in boardgame victory braggadocio in the past , carrying on about triumphs in such games as Trivial Pursuit , Balderdash , and Outburst ." One time , we were playing Scattergories with longtime couple Jeff Weitz and Kimberly Alford , and Evan got so bad , I had to cut the game short , " Vanderploeg said . " We didn ' t see them for , like , three months after that . "While Riedel admits to mentioning the Scrabble victory frequently , he denies any wrongdoing ." I ' m just teasing Amy , is all , " Riedel said . " Besides , I can ' t help it if I possess a superior vocabulary and stellar word formation skills . Cha ching ! " 	 1
WASHINGTON Reflecting attitudes held throughout his personal and political life , President Barack Obama restated Thursday his long standing fear that the U . S . government is even now putting measures in place to take his guns away .Obama , an avid gun enthusiast with an extensive history of mistrusting the federal government , claimed Washington ' s actions in recent years have been particularly egregious and described its " rabid anti gun zealotry " as " some real sinister , Nazi type shit . "" The thing for damn sure is you can ' t trust ' em , " Obama told reporters Thursday morning , cradling a . 22 caliber bolt action hunting rifle in his arms . " No matter how hard you work or how many taxes you pay , the goddamn government ' s sure as shit gonna pass some law or officiate some warrant to try and take your guns . Because when the people don ' t have any guns , that ' s when they take control . "" Just like in England , " the president added . " They took away all the guns there , and now they have video cameras all over the place to spy on everybody . You think America wouldn ' t do that if they could ? "According to President Obama , the U . S . government has for years made a concerted effort to " destroy the Second Amendment of the damned Constitution , for God ' s sake , " while silencing the voices of gun owners such as himself who merely wish to retain the ability to protect their home and family ." It ' s a slippery slope , I ' m telling you it starts with an assault weapons ban , which is a total crock , and then they use that to get their foot in the door to take away shotguns and rifles , too , " said the president , adding that he keeps an assortment of handguns locked in a safe in the White House basement in case of " emergencies . " " We ' re talking about an all out war on our right to keep and bear arms : global gun databases , secret watch lists , bullet serialization , microstamping . It is my constitutional right to own these firearms , okay ? And they can ' t wrench that right away from me . "" What if somebody breaks into the White House tonight ? " Obama continued . " Hell , I got a prerogative to protect my wife and kids . "Seemingly obsessed with security , Obama has reportedly used the heavily fortified Oval Office as a ' lair ' for most of his first term , eating and sleeping within its gun racked walls and exiting only for necessary state business . In such cases , Obama told reporters , he will not leave without an array of concealed weapons on his person .Beltway sources said a rifle armed figure resembling Obama has also been seen patrolling the White House roof in recent years , wearing what appears to be forest camouflage cargo pants , mirrored aviator sunglasses , and a sleeveless black " POW MIA " T shirt ." When the shit goes down , man , the militia is all you can rely on , " said Obama , who sources confirmed has formed a loose affiliation of local gun owners that meets on weekends to conduct what they call " training exercises " in the Rose Garden . " And believe me , the shit will go down . There is a war coming . And it ' s coming quick . And you just better hope that when it does go down you ' re not caught on the wrong side of that line , brother , because I will not hesitate to defend what I hold dear . "At press time , a user named " potus 44 " posted a message on an NRA message board that read : " rite to own guns only thing btwn tyrany and freedom . atf w fbi trying 2 control us , just like Brits in Rev War . fate of nation hangs in balance .

CHICAGO A coalition of die hard Cubs fans and Wrigley Field supporters introduced a drastic proposal at a Chicago city council meeting Tuesday , angrily calling for the demolition of the expensive , obsolete , 175 year old city surrounding the beloved ballpark .Hundreds of devoted Wrigley Field advocates attended the public hearing as thousands of like minded demonstrators gathered outside of City Hall , using chants , pamphlets , and signs to point out that the greater Chicagoland area is a decrepit eyesore and the outdated 10 , 856 square mile urban sprawl should immediately be razed ." It ' s truly a travesty that a hallowed franchise of Major League Baseball is still playing in a dilapidated city that should have been replaced decades ago , " said lead organizer Keith Garrison , addressing the assembly in a Ryne Sandberg jersey . " I ' m sure that to some of its more hardcore fans , Chicago has some charm in an antiquated way . But the greatest baseball team and fans in the world deserve something better than this dump . "" It ' s more suburbs than city anymore , for crying out loud , " Garrison added . " Instead of actually improving the place , they ' ll just keep adding more tacky stuff on until it ' s in danger of collapsing under its own weight . "Garrison , who presented a petition signed by more than 50 , 000 irate Cubs fans to mayor Rahm Emanuel , said that leveling the 234 square mile area immediately surrounding Wrigley Field would be " an excellent start , " eliminating a decades old blot on the landscape and providing an opportunity to construct a modern , multi use metropolis fit for a more contemporary and cosmopolitan urban resident .Supporters of the plan spoke at length about the archaic , crumbling , inefficient city that now encircles Wrigley Field , voicing complaints about inadequate access , the lack of decent concessions other than hot dogs , and the dozens of unsightly neighborhoods obstructing the view of the adored baseball stadium ." That whole Chicago area around Wrigley is decrepit and , if we ' re being honest , just plain ugly . Frankly , I just don ' t understand why we should hang on to the past , " said Cubs season ticket holder Mark Barger . " I ' ve never been a big fan of the skyline . We should get rid of it and put up some sleek , contemporary buildings that aren ' t so gaudy , something that doesn ' t look like it was built in a hurry in the late 1970s . "" Also , they should remove that tacky water feature , " added Barger , indicating the Chicago River . " It ' s right in the way of everything and old and gross and nobody even uses it . "The majority of fans lobbying for the demolition of the third most populous city in the United States also objected to the fact that Chicago lacks a retractable dome that could be closed on days with bad weather . Others criticized the area outside of Wrigley Field for being too cramped and deficient in decent seating , pointing out that , during the winter months and while the Cubs were on road swings , the city went largely unused anyway .Although Wrigley Field adherents acknowledged that tearing down the city of Chicago would be a colossal endeavor , the dedicated Cubs fans recommended accomplishing the task in small increments , starting with imploding U . S . Cellular Field and then bulldozing what remains of the South Side ." I know how this will sound to people who don ' t live here , but Chicago is totally cursed , " said Cubs fan Paul Griffin , who suggested the Cubs demand a new city as lovable as their legacy . " We shouldn ' t be afraid to knock this whole place down and start over . Nothing has happened in the place for over a century . "" Chicago will always be known as the place where dreams go to die . It ' s time to demolish it and get a brand new metropolis , " added Griffin .The optimistic Cubs fans informed city aldermen that destroying everything surrounding Wrigley Field would rally the local economy by creating millions of jobs to first tear down Chicago and then to rebuild the new , far better city . In addition , the plan suggested that finding a corporate sponsor to buy the naming rights could offset the costs of constructing and running Chicago ' s replacement .The plan to tear down Chicago , sources confirmed , was surprisingly popular with people from other cities in the region ." I hate that thing , " said Milwaukee resident Tim Rach . " It ' s such a shithole . It ' s expensive , the beer sucks , the food is overrated , and they ' re total assholes to visitors . " 	 1
The European Union is preparing to crack down on the volume of pips found in lemons .Horst Limeburger , leader of the new Citrus Division in Brussels , confirmed : " We have been receiving complaints from restaurants and hobby cooks . One caterer counted over 70 seeds in one lemon . It ' s getting out of control . "Parliamentary officials are combing the Union with lemon squeezers , random sampling incoming goods at seaports and conducting count checks at wholesale fruit markets .Fred Nut , wholesaler of oranges and lemons in Folkestone , England , commented , " Fair do . I mean if it ' s like that , well , you ' ve got to do something . It ' s criminal . They ' ve tried it on other stuff , but it didn ' t work . My carrots are still too long and my bananas droop west . Scandal , really . 36 pips is average , they say , but what if the lemon ' s a bit bigger , that ' s what I say . I dunno . "Limeburger is confident the issue can be resolved swiftly . " Our squeezers are experts . Similar allegations concerning the satsuma and the blood orange have also been made by major restaurants , but we can ' t cover everything . We ' re paid via tax money and have to spend it sensibly . "MEPs are to discuss the consistency of gherkins at an emergency sitting of the EU Parliament on Thursday . Members from several parties have filed a motion to standardize the ' sucking feeling ' experienced when biting into a pickled cucumber ." If I suck on something , I want to know what I ' m sucking on and what will happen " , explained Ruud van Daddel , European Deputy Secretary of Trade for Beans , Peppers , Pumpkins and Pickled Items . " People elected us to sort these things out , and that ' s what we ' re ghoing to do . We ' ve got to deliver . " 	 1

FBI , Tashfeen Malik ? who , with her husband , Syed Rizwan . . .It now appears , as some had predicted from the start , that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal massacre in San Bernardino were motivated not by disgruntlement over workplace slights , but by Islamic extremism . According to the FBI , Tashfeen Malik ? who , with her husband , Syed Rizwan . . .Culver City resident Lincoln Gable Riley lauds the police for their bravery and tactics :I am so proud of the San Bernardino County Sheriff ' s Department , the San Bernardino Police Department and the Redlands Police Department . Their conduct , professionalism and discipline shined so brilliantly when faced with heavily armed shooters in what became a running battle in city streets , and though reeling from eight years of financial crisis and the near inability to keep current with equipment , they demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt their superior teamwork , selflessness and ability to rapidly overwhelm the enemy and render the public safe .These officers should stand tall , for they ' ve earned much respect from this action . Lincoln Gable Riley , Culver CityI am particularly impressed and thrilled with their total lack of indecisive moments , their high efficiency without any wasted movement and the speed with which they reconfigured themselves to confront the threat and maintain the upper hand through superior force and tactics . They are truly brothers and sisters who watch each other ' s back and stand shoulder to shoulder against crime .These officers should stand tall , for they ' ve earned much respect from this action . I imagine many in police work were shocked and surprised , first at the amount of devastation the shooters created , and even more with the incredibly exquisite response in kind .My only regret is that the suspects lost their lives , which renders them unable to provide insight to further improve the response and prevents us from easily gaining information about how the structure of their action works . Their deaths also make it more difficult to see if they are part of a larger group .Glen Hovey of Redlands compares his local police with the attention those in other jurisdictions have received :With all the bad publicity police nationwide have been getting , I just want to thank all law enforcement involved in the San Bernardino shooting for keeping us safe . 	 0
European Space Agency HQ Bad Kockupp , Germany . ESA official , Harry Cheeks has just made one of the strangest " Good News Bad News " announcements in the history of space exploration .Mr Cheeks :" Ladies and gentlemen , I have the pleasant duty to inform you that the Beagle 2 has been located on Mars , in an unexpected location , but nevertheless in perfect working order ! "" Unfortunately , that good news must be tempered with some not so good news , concerning the unexpected location of Beagle 2 . "" As many of you will know , our working relationships with the US space agency , NASA , have always been extremely close and collegial . NASA has graciously provided us with not only advice on the design of some of Beagle ' s systems such as the parachutes and heat shield , but also helped us with the development of the control software for the Beagle 2 landing system . And as we have stated ad nauseam , our budget has been extremely tight . Frankly we could not have afforded the time and expense involved in developing such software from scratch , so we jumped at the chance to share NASA ' s work in this area . "" Unfortunately , it appears that our Chief Software Engineer , Dr Ross Ewage , did not exercise adequate judgment in using the software examples that NASA kindly provided for our use . Instead of using the example program listings as they were intended to be used , that is , as bloody examples , Dr Ewage copied the program instructions verbatim into our onboard computer , apparently overlooking some highly technical instructions in the NASA program listing , to wit : " Note : insert your own landing coordinates here . "" ESA have had no choice but to terminate the employment of Dr Ewage , who offered only the lame excuse that " I found the programs incomprehensible , being chock full of curious verbs and math symbols , and I guess I simply panicked . " It has only now come to light that the good Dr ' s credentials are as a Medical Doctor ( urinary tract specialty ) , rather than as a PhD ( quantitative astrophysics specialty , i . e . rocket scientist ) . Needless to say , a thorough review of ESA hiring and classification practices has been ordered . "" ESA has just communicated this rather delicate matter to NASA , begging their forgiveness , and asking them to please readjust their landing target . This , in order to avoid wrecking our little Beagle 2 , now calmly sitting on the surface of Mars , in the exact spot that the 1400 pound NASA lander is aiming for . " 	 1
Jurgen Klopp reveals Liverpool will make NO deadline day signings before window slams shutThe Reds had attempted to bring Shakhtar Donetsk striker Alex Teixeira into the club but with just hours to go , Klopp has confirmed there will be no dealsJurgen Klopp has delivered devastating news to Liverpool fans , by confirming there will be NO new signings before the window closes .The Reds boss was in playful mood yesterday , as he joked with reporters when asked whether he was close to doing any business . . . and responded that he didn ' t know how to answer : because I ' m not sure what ' s best for your work ! .But he revealed there won ' t be any deal for Brazilian midfielder Alex Teixeira , with talks collapsing after a ? 50m valuation from his club Shaktar Dontesk or any other signing when he added playfully :I can say maybe something ' s happening , or I can say the truth .

That ' s the situation .Rejected : Liverpool have turned down the approach for Jerome Sinclair from WatfordWatford were interested in young striker Jerome Sinclair , but that too is also unlikely to happen unless the Hornets come back with a significantly increased bid .The Liverpool manager also welcomed his former Bundesliga rival Pep Guardiola to the Premier League , with the current Bayern Munich boss confirming this afternoon he will join Manchester City at the end of the season .But he added : " I don ' t have any advice . It is a long trip for him to go . At Bayern he has enough work to do but when he is here it will be a very warm welcome like I had when I came here . 	 0

A defiant Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City can avoid Champions League elimination and still be crowned kings of Europe this season even though ' five or six squads ' in the competition are better than theirs .The Premier League champions are on the brink of disaster after picking up two points from their opening three Group E games , and must beat CSKA Moscow at the Etihad on Wednesday night to keep alive their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage .But Pellegrini insists that City can beat the odds by sneaking out of the group phase with a low points total and go on to win the competition .Manchester City players train at the Etihad stadium ahead of Wednesday ' s clash with CSKA MoscowJoe Hart is put through his paces ahead of the crucial Champions League clash against the RussiansCity ' s players warm up on the pitch at the Etihad ahead of a game they know they must win' There are teams that qualify with few points and then after that they won the Champions League , ' said Pellegrini .' Of course our target is always to try and win the Champions League . We must put in our mind that we are able to do it , that we have a good squad .' Maybe there are also five or six squads better than our squad or the same level as our squad that also want to do it but with a winning mentality and an ambitious mind , you must always think you can do it . I think we have time to prove it .City ' s Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure , sporting a personalised snood , shares a joke with Samir NasriFernando also took part while wearing a snood as City prepared for the home Champions League gameManchester City assistant manager Brian Kidd watches over the players in training on Tuesday' We have to play three games more . This year , all the games we had to play against big teams , we didn ' t lose in one of them . We drew with Chelsea and Arsenal in the league , we beat Tottenham and Manchester United .' We have to finish the qualifying ( stage ) and then we can make all the conclusions and analyse what happened with this team in Champions League . 'Having lost their opening game to Bayern Munich , City have suffered disappointing draws after surrendering leads to Roma and CSKA .Pellegrini denied that his players lack confidence in Europe , and predicted that the group will not be decided until final game in Rome next month .He added : ' The three games of the Champions League were strange games I think . We were very unlucky to lose against Bayern Munich , the most difficult game of the group in the last minute with the rebound of the set piece .England stars Hart and James Milner look in good spirits ahead of the crucial game against CSKAManuel Pelligrini has denied that Wednesday ' s game is ' sudden death ' but admits it is crucialThe City boss says if his team can get through the group they still have a chance of winning the competition' After that , here against Roma we didn ' t play well and Roma were in a very good moment . And in Russia I think we played very well but with an excess of trust we couldn ' t win but we are planning to arrange that and I hope we will do it .' Last year we were the club that qualified with the biggest amount of points every time with 15 points . What happened this year in the three games of the Champions League , we have time to arrange it and I am sure we are going to arrange it .' It is impossible to be sure but I think this group will be decided in the last game in Italy against Roma . We will see what happens , we are going to try to win our two games at home and see what the other teams do but I am sure this will be decided in the last game . '' I think it is a very important game but it is not a ( sudden ) death game because until mathematics can ' t fix it , you can continue . We must win this game because we have just two points and we have three games to play and it is very important to have more points . We will consider it not a final game but a very important game . 'Manchester City have just two points from their first three games , and will need to improve to qualifyEliaquim Mangala ( right ) is back from injury , and could be in line to start on Wednesday nightCity will be without Aleksandar Kolarov and Frank Lampard , Pellegrini confirmed , although Eliaquim Mangala has returned to the squad .Kolarov picked up a calf injury during the warm up before last Sunday ' s Manchester derby , and will be out for around a month . 	 0

Bamako , Mali A rapid deployment of an international military force is essential to solving Mali ' s security crisis , regional and international leaders said after a meeting Friday in the nation ' s capital ." Mali needs a political transition through transparent elections within 12 months , functioning institutions and an immediate deployment of international troops , " said Daniel Kablan , chairman of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) .U . N . Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson said his organization is ready to provide immediate support to aid national dialogue and assist in political negotiations ." We will immediately bring military planners and security sector advisers " to Bamako , the Malian capital , the secretary said .ECOWAS can provide military training , logistics and reinforcement of Mali ' s own forces , Kablan said .Leaders from the European Union , United Nations and Western African states met as al Qaeda linked rebels tighten their grip in the north of the country .Malians for and against military intervention have protested on the streets of the capital in recent days , highlighting a divide in citizens ' opinion .Last week , the U . N . Security Council approved a resolution that gives regional leaders 45 days to provide detailed plans for an international military intervention . Friday ' s meeting was a follow up to the resolution ." Beyond this sad situation , there is the serious threat that the entrenchment of terrorist and criminal network poses to Mali , the region and beyond . This is a threat we cannot afford to take lightly , and the danger extends far beyond Africa . The sooner we deal with it , the better , " said Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , chief of the African Union Commission .Mali was plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president , shaking one of West Africa ' s most stable democracies .The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government . However , uncertainty looms as Islamist militants roaming the north wage a campaign of destruction .Soon after the coup , ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants took advantage of the power vacuum to seize the northern part of the country .Two groups with ties to al Qaeda later toppled the Tuareg movement , and now control two thirds of northern Mali , an area the size of France ." The crisis is Malian , but the development affects the neighboring countries , our partners . And we need international help to fight the Islamists , to organize free and fair elections , and to help restore our country , " interim Malian President Dioncounda Traore said .West African leaders and the transitional government have asked the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention to oust the rebels .The resolution approved last week tasked U . N . Secretary General Ban Ki moon with working with African leaders to submit to the Security Council within 45 days " detailed and actionable recommendations " in preparation for the deployment of an international military force in Mali .As leaders work to find a solution , grim reports of human rights violations are emerging in the north .Radical Islamists are compiling a list of unmarried mothers , raising fears of cruel punishments such as stoning , amputations and executions , a senior United Nations official said this month .The list will include women who have had children out of wedlock and those who are unmarried and pregnant , according to Ivan Simonovic , the U . N . assistant secretary general for human rights .The Islamists have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law , or Sharia . They say the law condemns relations outside marriage .Extremists have conducted public executions , amputations , floggings and other punishments .In addition to human rights violations , Islamists razed tombs near the desert city of Timbuktu on Thursday the latest attacks targeting cultural heritage sites in the north .The rebels have destroyed tombs and shrines in the city , which features various ancient and prominent burial sites .They regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their religion . Sufi shrines , which they consider sacrilegious , have been subjected to the most attacks . Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat by Islamic hardliners . 	 0
CLEVELAND Kyrie Irving played a set of modified 1 on 1 games against LeBron James after the Cleveland Cavaliers ' shootaround Saturday and destroyed him , a team source told ESPN . com .They weren t true games of 1 on 1 in the sense that only one dribble was allowed per possession , thus rendering James significant size advantage moot as he couldn t simply back Irving down with his dribble and post him up . Games finished with the first player to score three baskets .Getting hot from the outside with his shot helped Irving succeed , per the source .To be fair , James ultimately evened the set of games 2 2 before the pair finished for the afternoon , but Irving was , apparently , in the zone .For a guy who hasn t played a game in more than five months as he continues to recover from a fractured left kneecap that he suffered in Game 1 of the Finals , Irving s performance against James , the four time MVP , certainly can help boost the three time All Star s confidence and reaffirm the rehab work he has already put in .He has advanced to running plays 5 on 0 . He s doing some light 1 on 1 contact drills . He s certainly taking some steps forward , Cavs coach David Blatt said before Cleveland s 109 97 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday . Again , can I put a number on it in terms of days left until we see him back out there fully ? I really can t . I m not trying to keep it from you . I just don t know . But definitely seeing progress in the last few days and that s encouraging .In addition to the advancements Blatt mentioned , Irving has also added pregame shooting on the court to his training regimen .The team is not putting any pressure on Irving to hasten his recovery , however , even with point guard Mo Williams missing the past two games with a right ankle injury and listed as doubtful for Monday s game against Orlando .Irving will not accompany the Cavs on their two game road trip through Toronto and Charlotte next week , but he could be back on the road full time come Dec . 10 when Cleveland travels to Orlando and Boston , per a source .A lot of times , him not coming on the road trip has to do with the amount of work , the body of work , that we can do with him back here at the facility , the type of treatment that he can receive , Blatt said . Part of that was with the idea in mind that we could accelerate it a little bit if we were having him under the right conditions . We ll see going down when he s going to start traveling more consistently with us .Blatt said Irving s demeanor on the bench during games has become more involved as he senses his comeback date drawing near .I think it sort of tells you that he s getting closer and closer . He recognizes that his time is coming , Blatt said . . . . He feels more a part of it . When you re sitting on the side and you re not able to participate in drills or even part of a shootaround , you get a little bit removed from it . Ky is becoming immersed again in the team and you see that in his activity level during the games . It bodes well for us and him . We miss him .He s getting there , Cavs fans . Irving ' s return might not quite be imminent , but it s not far off , either . 	 0
Published : 14 : 52 EST , 6 November 2015 Updated : 14 : 53 EST , 6 November 2015The Kremlin on Friday angrily condemned France ' s Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine for publishing political cartoons on the Egypt plane crash in which 224 people died , most of them Russian tourists ." In our country we can sum this up in a single word , sacrilege , " President Vladimir Putin ' s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists ." This has nothing to do with democracy or self expression . It is sacrilege . "The wreckage of a crashed A321 Russian airliner in Wadi al Zolomat in Hassana province , a mountainous area of Egypt ' s Sinai Peninsula ? Seliman Al Oteifi ( Egyptian Prime Minister ' s Office AFP File )The Kremlin spokesman called the cartoons " unacceptable " but said Russia would not make an official complaint .One cartoon shows debris and human remains raining down on an armed IS militant , with the caption : " IS : Russian aviation is intensifying bombardments , " a reference to its air strikes in Syria .Another shows a skull with a pair of sunglasses hanging off it with the crashed plane in the background .It is titled " The dangers of Russian low cost airlines " , and the speech bubble says " I should have taken Air Cocaine , " a reference to a current scandal over French pilots smuggling drugs from the Dominican Republic .Jihadist gunmen shot dead 12 people in an attack on Charlie Hebdo ' s offices in January enraged at its cartoons of Prophet Mohammed .On Russian language Twitter , hashtags " Charlie Hebdo " and " I ' m not Charlie " were among the top trends on Friday .Writing on Twitter , the lower house of parliament ' s international affairs chief Alexei Pushkov asked : " Is there any limit to Russophobia on the pages of Western media ?" As the whole world comforts us , Charlie Hebdo preaches its vile right to sacrilege . "Russian state television news gave lengthy coverage to criticism of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons , which it did not show ." It ' s not satire but filthy mockery , " said the deputy speaker of the lower house , Ivan Melnikov , in televised comments ." Is anyone else ' Charlie ' ? " asked foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Facebook , referring to the message " Je Suis Charlie " circulated by the magazine ' s supporters after the massacre .But the magazine ' s editor in chief Gerard Biard hit back , slamming the Kremlin for " using Charlie Hebdo to create a controversy where none exists which is the usual manipulation you get from totalitarian regimes . "Russian authorities had also tried to misrepresent it when Putin opponent Boris Nemtsov was shot near the Kremlin in February , he claimed ." This is not new . . . They said he ( Nemtsov ) was killed because he supported Charlie Hebdo , " Biard told AFP , referring to claims that Moscow had attempted to deflect the blame onto Islamist militants ." This magazine is supposed to be irreverent . And we respect the values of democracy and freedom of expression which the Russian powers that be in this case do not , " he added ." Their argument about sacrilege is absurd . Are we supposed to no longer comment on the news in a different way or to say nothing more than it ' s sad ? If so that becomes a problem for freedom of expression . "The French foreign ministry had earlier said in a statement that " journalists are free to express their opinions in France , the authorities do not get involved . "The cartoons , published on Wednesday , have not been widely covered in French media , which is accustomed to the magazine ' s tendency to push the boundaries .Both Washington and London say a bomb may have downed the Russian plane carrying tourists from the Sinai Peninsula resort of Sharm el Sheikh while up until Friday , Cairo and Moscow had sought to downplay the suggestion of an attack .People stand next to flowers at a makeshift memorial for the victims of the Russian MetroJet Airbus A321 crash on November 4 , 2015 in Saint Petersburg ?

The Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off southern Alaska this week is sound and ready to be towed to safe harbor , a company official said Saturday , adding there is no evidence of any sheen in the vicinity .The 266 foot diameter Kulluk remains upright and there is no apparent threat to its stability , said Sean Churchfield , the incident commander and operations manager for Shell Alaska .The fuel tanks appear intact , and naval architects report the vessel is sound and fit to tow , he said .The Killuk ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island , about 200 miles south of Anchorage , on Monday night . The current tow plan calls for the barge to be towed 30 miles to the north to Kiliuda Bay for safe harbor and a more detailed assessment ." The exact timing of a potential towing activity will depend on weather , tides and operational readiness , " Churchfield told reporters in a news conference .As much as 150 , 000 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel and approximately 12 , 000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the Kulluk , which had been working in the Beaufort Sea , off Alaska ' s North Slope , until October .The vessel was being towed back to its winter home in Seattle when it ran into a severe storm off the Alaskan coast . The Coast Guard evacuated the Kulluk ' s 18 man crew Dec . 29 , and it drifted for 10 hours the following day after the tug that was towing it lost power .Monday night , tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24 foot waves . That led to its grounding in an area where water depth is 32 to 48 feet .The Kulluk is a blue and white circular rig with a helicopter landing pad and a tower in the middle . The steel vessel is double hulled and designed for drilling in Arctic waters .Most of the nearby shore is owned by a native Alaskan corporation on adjacent Kodiak Island , said Steven Russell , of Alaska ' s Department of Environmental Conservation . State officials are working with residents to watch for any environmental impact caused by the grounding .Shell ' s Arctic exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after BP ' s Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .Shell says it ' s working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted off Louisiana , killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap . The fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations Shell conducted off the North Slope , on the opposite side of the vast state from where the Kulluk now rests .The U . S . Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1 , 700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling . And the shrinking of the region ' s sea ice which hit record lows in 2012 has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region .Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon rich fossil fuels . The science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists . 	 0
Anger in Italy as statues covered to save Iranian blushes" Respect for other cultures cannot and must not mean negating our own , " said former lawmaker Luca Squeri .A gilded bronze Greek statue of Hercules ( C ) dated 300 BC , and equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius , dating to the Roman emperor ' s reign , appear in their new hall at the Capitoline museum in Rome December 22 , 2005 . Photo : ReutersItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi came under fire on Tuesday after ancient nude statues in Rome ' s Capitoline museum were covered up to avoid any possible offense to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani who is visiting the country .Italy and Iran will sign up to 17 billion euros of business deals during the two day visit of the Iranian delegation which began on Monday , but Italian opposition leaders and commentators said Renzi had gone too far to please his guest .Politicians on the left and right said not only had Renzi made almost no reference to Iran ' s human rights record during a joint news conference , but had also " surrendered " Italy ' s cultural identity by hiding the nude statues of women ." Respect for other cultures cannot and must not mean negating our own , " said Luca Squeri , a lawmaker in former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ' s center right Forza Italia party . " This isn ' t respect , it ' s cancelling out differences and it ' s a kind of surrender . "At Iran ' s request Italy also kept wine off the menu at a ceremonial dinner on Monday evening .Northern League deputy Barbara Saltamartini said covering the statues with white panels was an " act of submission , " while the party ' s leader Matteo Salvini wrote on his facebook page that it was " crazy " .Gianluca Peciola , of the Left , Ecology and Freedom party , called on Renzi to explain " a disgraceful decision which is a mortification of art and culture as universal values " .The 41 year old Renzi met with similar criticism last year when he covered up nude pictures in the renaissance town hall of Florence , the city where he used to be mayor , on the occasion of a visit by the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates .Also read : Iran bans the word ' wine ' from books , sees it as a solution to throttle westernizationFor more news from India Today , follow us on Twitter indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook . com IndiaTodayFor news and videos in Hindi , go to AajTak . in . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . 	 0
Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud believes he is playing some of the best football of his career and insists he is unfazed by any accusations of inconsistency .The Frenchman ' s brace against Newcastle on Saturday brought his seasonal tally to 17 goals in 26 appearances so far , as The Gunners remain on course to secure a top four finish in the Premier League .Giroud told RMC Sport , ' Since I have been at Arsenal , this is perhaps my best period .

'He added , ' Obviously , it ' s was not at the good moment because I lacked efficiency in that game . I did a little teasing . But it ' s good to have shown mental strength to come back even stronger and prove that critics do not reach me . 'Only Chelsea ' s Costa and Tottenham ' s Harry Kane have scored more than Giroud in the league this season and both have played over 500 minutes more game time .Giroud has scored 17 goals in 26 appearances for Arsenal this season and is not ruling out a late title push 	 0
MESQUITE , TX Singlemindedly focused on his goal of adding inches to his stomach , thighs and hips , area resident Darren Steifler has for more than five years been an avid weightgainer ." I ' ve worked hard and really seen results , " said the 295 pound Steifler , 38 , who describes himself as " much happier and more well rounded " since beginning his weightgaining regimen in April 1994 . " I ' ve bulked up significantly . And people are definitely noticing the results . "Steifler , who weighed just 165 pounds when he began , said he advocates an all out approach to weightgaining ." A lot of guys think that three big sessions a day are all you need to get big , " said Steifler while doing a set of 20 fork lifts . " But you ' ve got to keep at it all the time . "Steifler keeps his workout varied throughout the week , " blasting his abdominals " with multiple sets of chili cheese fries one day , then " packing his glutes " with a hardcore Ben Jerry ' s Chunky Monkey session the next .Cardiac fitness is also important . " I usually do 30 toffee crunches , followed by at least 40 chip dips enough to really ' feel the burn ' in my heart , " Steifler said . " If you do it right , you feel it in your whole chest for hours . Then I use a high quality dietary supplement , such as Tums or Rolaids , to keep it all from coming back on me . "Steifler also stressed the importance of rest . " When you ' re on a serious weightgaining regimen , you have to make sure to give your body plenty of down time , " Steifler said . " I ' d recommend sitting on the couch at least seven hours a day , ideally 10 . You really want to avoid any empty calorie burning . "One of the best things about weightgaining , Steifler said , is that the average person needs no fancy equipment to get started ." Sure , you see a lot of guys who buy expensive La Z Boys and join supper clubs , but you really don ' t need all that , " Steifler said . " All you really need is some fried chicken and a basic kitchen chair or couch . You honestly can do it all right from your own home . "Steifler ' s wife of seven years , Denise , said she is impressed with her husband ' s new body ." I could see the change in him right away , " Denise said . " Some girls don ' t like the bulked up look , but I just think there ' s more of him to love . "Though Steifler is pleased that Denise is supportive of his weightgaining efforts , he would rather she not take up the sport ." It might sound weird , but I don ' t really like the look of female weightgainers , " Steifler said . " That kinda stuff really turns some guys on , but I just don ' t think it ' s feminine . To me , it just looks gross . "Still , Steifler wholeheartedly recommends his hobby . " You ' ll be surprised how soon you see results , " Steifler said . " Don ' t expect to see significant gains right away , but if you stick with it , within a year , you ' ll hardly recognize yourself . " 	 1
new york hailed by media critics as the fluffiest, most toothless, and softest hitting coverage of the presidential candidate to date, a story in this week's time magazine is being called the definitive barack obama puff piece. " no news publication has dared to barely scratch the surface like this before, " columnist and campaign reporter michael king wrote in the washington post tuesday. " this profile sets a benchmark for mindless filler by which all other features about sen. obama will now be judged. just impressive puff journalism all around. " the 24 page profile, entitled " boogyin'with barack, " hit newsstands monday and contains photos of the candidate as a baby, graduating from columbia university, standing and laughing, holding hands with his wife and best friend, michelle, greeting a crowd of blue collar autoworkers, eating breakfast with diner patrons, and staring pensively out of an airplane window while a pen and legal pad rest comfortably on his lowered tray table. according to political analysts, the time piece features the most lack of depth reporting on obama ever published, and for the first time reveals a number of inconsequential truths about the candidate, including how he keeps in shape on the campaign trail, and which historical figures the presidential hopeful would choose to have dinner with. " the sheer breadth of fluff in this story is something to be marveled at, " new york times washington bureau chief dean baquet said. " it's all here. favorite books, movies, meals, and seasons of the year ranked one through four. sure, we asked obama what his favorite ice cream was, but time did us one better and asked,'what's your favorite ice cream, really?'" time managing editor rich stengel said he was proud of the obama puff piece, and that he hoped it would help to redefine the boundaries of journalistic drivel. " when the american people cast their vote this november, this is the piece of fluff they're going to remember, " stengel said. " not the ones by newsweek, harper's, the new yorker, the atlantic, the new republic, the economist, nightline, the wall street journal, or even that story about lessons obama learned from his first grade teacher we ran a month ago. " the article, which follows obama for 12 days during his campaign, was written by reporter chris sherwood, and is relentless in its attempt to capture the candidate at his most poised and polished. sherwood said the profile easily trumps all other fluff pieces in its effort to expose the presidential candidate for who he really is : " an awesome guy. " " my editors told me that if i wanted to uncover the most frivolous, trivial information on obama, i had to be prepared to follow the puff, " sherwood said. " that meant that not only did i have to stay and watch sen. obama play endless games of basketball with city firemen to show readers how athletic and youthful he is, but i also had to go to nba shooting experts to learn what aspects of his jump shot are good and what parts are great. " sherwood said he was granted full access to the candidate, and was permitted by chief strategist david axelrod to ask any question he desired an opportunity the reporter used to lob the easiest softballs at obama yet, ranging from how happy he felt when he met his wife to what songs are currently on his ipod playlist. sherwood was also fearless in his effort to paint the candidate as someone who is " surprisingly down to earth, " a phrase that is used a total of 26 times throughout the feature. " if we were going to get the story we wanted, it was my responsibility as a journalist to ask the really tough questions to his two young daughters, " said sherwood, who grilled malia and sasha obama, 9 and 7, about whether they were " proud of their daddy. " " i also had to capitalize on every opportunity to compare the story of obama's upbringing and rise to power to that of martin luther king, jr.'s and john f. kennedy's, no matter how suspect those parallels really are. " according to the time reporter, work on the profile was often harder than he had anticipated, with obama at times dodging questions about whether or not he played a musical instrument, and about what monopoly piece he thought best represented his candidacy and why. " situations like these are when you have to get on the phone and talk, not only to his mother, but to his aunt, his uncle, a boy scout leader, or maybe even one of his camp counselors growing up, " sherwood said. " and if they don't return your call, you turn to sunday school teachers and former babysitters anyone who is willing to go on record and say that barack obama was a really good kid who was destined for great things.

DUBAI Calling it the most ambitious project of its kind ever undertaken , officials from Dubai ' s Department of Economic Development announced Tuesday the emirate ' s plans to construct the world ' s largest human rights violation .Set to begin later this month , the project , dubbed Saqr Ganzeer , or " Chained Falcon , " will reportedly take as long as 10 years to complete and make use of more than 250 , 000 foreign workers from the Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia . It is expected to easily surpass all previous record holders , towering over every other abuse of rights in the wealthy Middle Eastern city ." With this bold new endeavor , we will create the biggest deprivation of basic human dignity the world has ever seen , " said DED deputy director Jamal Al Falasi , who according to reports was selected to oversee the project after successfully managing several of Dubai ' s smaller violations of individuals ' freedoms . " None of the others will even come close . Once completed , it will be recognized everywhere as a symbol of Dubai and everything our city stands for . "" It really is humbling to be part of an undertaking this historic in scope . "Emirati sources expressed confidence that before it is even finished , Saqr Ganzeer will generate a " huge splash in the international community , easily overshadowing human rights offenses in countries like Sudan , North Korea , Syria , China , and the Democratic Republic of Congo , which they said will look miniscule in comparison .International observers agreed that as soon as the project is underway , Dubai ' s claim to the title of world ' s greatest human rights infringement will likely be measured and officially certified by several independent organizations .Bangladeshi laborer Tajuddin Rahman , one of tens of thousands who was lured to the emirate for the monumental exploitation of fundamental liberties , told reporters that while he knows it won ' t be easy toiling for countless hours on the project , he hopes his family back home will be proud of his sacrifice ." It really is humbling to be part of an undertaking this historic in scope , " said Rahman , who explained he ' s eager to begin working on the project , as he needs to start funneling all his wages to his labor contractor for the next several years to pay back the cost of funding his travel to the UAE . " It will take many years to complete , so I realize I might not be around long enough to see it finished . "" I only hope that when this is done , people will take notice , " he added . 	 1
SPRINGFIELD , IL With the drunk driving fatality rate nearly tripling in Illinois in the past year , the state ' s Department of Motor Vehicles announced Monday it will re examine its controversial " One For The Road " driver relaxation promotional campaign ." Driving a car can be an incredibly stressful experience , " DMV spokesperson Dale Penn said . " That was the idea behind One For The Road we felt it was important for motorists to loosen up a bit before getting behind the wheel . "" It does seem , though , " Penn added , " that the program may have needed some fine tuning . "According to Penn , the One For The Road program had its roots in a DMV study revealing a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and driver confidence ." We found that people who had consumed at least four beers or two mixed drinks before getting behind the wheel were twice as likely to believe they were in no danger of getting hurt or killed , " Penn said . " When operating a serious piece of machinery like a car , that ' s just the kind of confidence you need . "Among the DMV study ' s other findings : A majority of elderly respondents and female college freshmen reported being " more mellow " and " really tuned into the road " after just a single drink .Launched last fall , the 3 million One For The Road campaign included talks by police officers at Illinois high schools encouraging kids to start " thinking about drinking " a statewide drunk driving poster contest and a series of print and television ads featuring the slogans , " Before You Hit The Road , Hit The Sauce , " and " Unwind . . . To Survive ! "In the time since the September 1996 launch of One For The Road , some 2 , 300 DUI related fatalities have occurred in Illinois , a 275 percent increase over the previous year ." Perhaps we need to reconsider certain aspects of the program , " said Bill Gerhardt , co creator of the program . " We need to ask ourselves , ' What parts of this program are not working , and how can we fix them ? ' "Despite the widespread criticism of One For The Road , some safety experts have expressed concern over what might happen without the program ." If this program is cut , there are going to be countless alcoholics driving around sober , their hands shaking so bad they can ' t even keep them on the wheel . It ' s just not safe , " said Hal Knauer , a safety advisor for the Illinois Board of Transportation . " A person like that relies on alcohol for steady nerves . "Added Glenn Sturbert , an Illinois licensed driver examination official : " Some of these 16 year olds come in here so nervous that I ' m afraid to get in the car with them . Now , I myself can ' t give them something to take the edge off the DMV only has a Class B liquor license but what ' s going on at home that the parental concern isn ' t there ? "Penn noted that even with the program ' s suspension , many brochures are available from the DMV offering information on " getting loose . " " These materials are there so that no driver can ever claim ignorance as a reason for having driven in an unnecessarily tense state , " he said .One For The Road is not the only DMV program currently under fire . Also being investigated are the campaigns " Smoke Up For Safety " and " Pack First ! " 	 1

LONDON Embroiled in a vast phone hacking scandal involving the company he founded , respected entrepreneur and News Corp . CEO Rupert Murdoch expressed concern Monday that he might have caused significant damage to his heretofore pristine reputation .Murdoch , who established his widely admired career on the foundations of basic morality and sound business ethics , has , until now , been revered as a pillar of honesty and accountability in the media world . However , the Australian American billionaire said the events of the past few months could make it very difficult for him to restore honor to his otherwise spotless legacy ." I have spent more than 50 years working to establish a r sum of integrity , virtue , and unwavering beneficence , and now it could all be washed away by this one careless mistake , " said Murdoch , speaking with the candor , sensitivity , and humility for which he is greatly admired . " I have let down my family , I have let down my employees , but most importantly , I have let down all of those around the world who have long known me as both a genuine humanitarian and a gatekeeper for truth . "As news of the scandal continues to blemish the tradition of journalistic excellence and dignity exemplified by News Corp . owned outlets such as the New York Post and the Fox News channel , Murdoch himself has remained focused on rectifying his missteps , starting with paying those affected out of his own pocket ." Look , anyone who knows me knows that I have never cared about money , " said Murdoch , explaining that his distress over invading the private lives of citizens far outweighs his concern for his company ' s quickly falling stock prices . " While some of my competitors focus on sensationalist or partisan headlines to sell papers , I ' ve always been willing to do whatever it takes to ensure my products are as fair and committed to the truth as I myself am . After all , truth and fairness are what people have come to expect from Rupert Murdoch . "" You don ' t get to be the world ' s most successful media mogul by being unscrupulous , " Murdoch added .Members of the media elite said they were stunned to learn that Murdoch , who has always served as the exemplar of all that is good and decent in his profession , was capable of such a clear ethical violation ." I keep waiting to hear a report that this is all some kind of mistake , " media expert Ken Auletta said of the controversy that has caused millions of people to reassess their opinion of Rupert Murdoch as a man of the most upstanding moral pedigree . " If someone like Rupert who I think we can all agree was regarded as one of the finest human beings on the planet before this shocking scandal broke can compromise his values and violate the principles of journalistic integrity that he himself has always been so deeply committed to , it really makes you lose faith in the entire industry . "Despite the fallout from the controversy continuing to implicate News Corp . employees and other powerful people throughout the United Kingdom , Murdoch has been lauded for unflinchingly bearing the full burden of the scandal ." Obviously , my only recourse is to protect what ' s left of my reputation and the reputation of News Corp . by resigning as chairman and CEO , " Murdoch said . " There can be no scapegoats . And out of respect for the victims , I will not settle any charges against me out of court . Justice must be served . " 	 1

miami dolphins : the dolphins'offense has a lot of unanswered questions this week. the group fired former offensive coordinator bill lazor and promoted quarterbacks coach zac taylor, who will call plays for the first time sunday against the ravens. miami is also trying to figure out how much freedom to give fourth year quarterback ryan tannehill and has two starters on the offensive line ailing center mike pouncey ( foot ) and right tackle ja'wuan james ( toe ). james walkernew england patriots : dt dominique easley was a new addition to the injury report, as he didn't practice wednesday because of an ankle injury. easley, a 2014 first round pick, is the team's top interior sub rusher. the patriots are deep at dt, and probably would consider using a de such as chandler jones or jabaal sheard as an interior rusher in sub packages if easley is unavailable for sunday's game against the eagles. mike reissnew york jets : thursday will be a key day for injured cb darrelle revis ( concussion ). if he misses practice again and he probably will the chances of him playing sunday would be remote. backup marcus williams ( knee ) is iffy, too, so they could end up starting darrin walls or buster skrine, the nickel back against odell beckham jr. and the giants. rich ciminibaltimore ravens : rookie running back buck allen is going against the 32nd ranked run defense for the second straight week. after gaining 55 yards ( an average of 4. 6 yards per carry ) at cleveland, allen now faces a miami dolphins defense that has given up an nfl worst average of 138. 5 yards rushing per game. the question is whether offensive coordinator marc trestman will commit to the run. the ravens have run the ball 271 times this season, which ranks 23rd in the league. jamison hensleycincinnati bengals : offensive coordinator hue jackson said wednesday that with december now here and the stretch run to the playoffs beginning, he believes the 9 2 bengals are going to start practicing and playing even better. as jackson put it, " we're about to get turnt. it's time.

liverpool manager brendan rodgers has said qualifying for the champions league again would be a bigger achievement than running manchester city close to the premier league title last season. and the anfield boss, whose side face city at anfield on sunday two places outside the top four, claims the pressure is on manchester united and arsenal in the race to get among europe's elite. rodgers is on a 10 game unbeaten league run though thursday's europa cup exit against besiktas was costly because it closed one possible route to the champions league and upset preparations with the players not returning to merseyside until 4am on friday morning. brendan rodgers says finishing in the top four this season would eclipse last year's achievementsliverpool were knocked out of europe in midweek, but have had a busier schedule this seasonhe believes the club's early season woes are behind them they were 10th as recently as december and says the players deserve credit for overcoming the loss of luis suarez, a long term injury to daniel sturridge, the impending departure of steven gerrard, the extra demands of european competition and the difficulty in assimilating eight new signings made over the summer.'if we arrive in the top four this year, with everything we have been though, it will be a greater achievement than last year. absolutely,'said rodgers.'it was certainly an incredible achievement to go so close last year but we only had to play one game a week. making the top four this year would certainly be better.'our backs were against the wall, we weren't playing very well and when you don't win games you get criticism. no one likes it but you have to accept it. there is no doubt this season we have leareda lot and by the end of it i will be a better manager.'one of arsenal, manchester united and liverpool are set to miss out on champions league football next season, a hammer blow to any of those huge clubs. rodgers claimed :'i think there is probably a big pressure on manchester united and arsenal from where they've been probably over the last 15 to 20 years. last season, with luis suarez in the team, rodgers'side finished second behind manchester city'manchester united is a club that has been synonymous with that and probably through to at least the quarter finals of the competition. arsene wenger's record of getting them qualified has been outstanding. that is what you are up against. but i think it tells you the competition in this country. it's quite exciting really that you are fighting until the end.'liverpool's famous 3 2 win against city last april put them top of the premier league and seven poitns clear of manuel pellegrini's side, though they did have two games in hand. but a home defeat against chelsea and draw at crystal palace cost them and they eventually fell two points short. rodgers insists he has been too busy to dwell on it this season but acknowledges it is something he could look back on in years to come. of more immediate importance is trying to get liverpool back into the champions league after this season's disappointment that saw them exit at the group stage.'that is the priority,'says the manager. liverpool's reputation worldwide is second only to manchester united largely due to their success in the 1970s and 80s but with chelsea and manchester city growing their fan bases, owner john w henry needs to keep the club among the elite to protect his brand. rodgers talks to his team before the penalty exit against besiktas on thursday night in istanbulliverpool take on champions city on sunday hoping to keep pace with arsenal and manchester unitedunited had to pay over the odds for the likes of angel di maria, marcos rojo and ander herrera to compensate for missing out on the champions league. liverpool haven't got similar cash to burn on transfer fees or wages they only escaped fpp punishment last week because they successfully argued part of their spending was for an expansion of their stadium.'we are about developing and creating world class talent. liverpool is still talked about as a worldwide club, which is important,'he said. jordan henderson is likely to return to the team for the crucial premier league clash against manchester citymario balotelli, replaced by rodgers on thursday, is in the squad to face his former side on sunday'i think the top four looked a long way off from where we were but we always believed that once we could work together and have more working time together, we could challenge. again it is the elite competition, the champions league, it is where the best players and managers want to work and we put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity to do that.'jordan henderson and lazar markovic are expected to return from the side that lost on penalties to besiktas though gerrard is still out with a hamstring problem. there could be a place in the 	 0

"Nike ' s first project following the announcement will be a 40 minute , 200 million spot scheduled to air during halftime of Super Bowl XXXI in January 1997 .The spot , which is already being touted as " the most killer commercial of all time " by industry insiders , will feature appearances by Warner Bros . cartoon favorite Wile E . Coyote , supermodel Naomi Campbell and box office superstar Bruce Willis , as well as " kitschy " cameos by TV ' s Adam " Batman " West and Barbara " I Dream of Jeannie " Eden .The digital special effects and hyper realistic alien space battle sequences in the new Nike ad are said to represent major breakthroughs in effects magic , and required the construction of a brand new Nike supercomputer , as well as over 35 kilotons of pyrotechnic explosives .In the ad ' s climactic finale sequence , the nation of Iceland will actually be destroyed and replaced with a 50 mile long scale model of the Air Gravitas , an imaginary new Nike hiking shoe ." In the past , with so much of our budget going toward things like research and development , and employee salaries , a project like this would not have been feasible , " Knight said . " Now , from a financial standpoint , our ability to inspire the world ' s athletes through a barrage of stirring visual images and high volume , exclusively licensed , let ' s get really freaking pumped rock music is almost limitless . "Nike officials are sure the new ad will top any previous advertising achievements the Nike corporation can boast . " Rest assured , if the Air Gravitas were real , everybody in the world would want a pair after seeing this commercial , " Knight said . " If we were actually selling the Air Gravitas , it would go down as the most successfully marketed shoe in history . "According to Nike spokespeople , the company will fire most of its 6 , 800 employees , keeping only those in its advertising division . Nike plans to offer the fired employees ' combined salary of 210 million to basketball superstar Shaquille O ' Neal , the only major superstar not currently under contract with Nike .In the event O ' Neal balks at the Nike offer , the company will terminate long distance runner Joan Benoit Samuelson ' s 10 , 000 annual contract and add it to his offer ." Basically , we feel that there are a lot more important things in this life than selling shoes , " Knight said . " When a Nike commercial ends , and the ' Just Do It ' logo fills the screen , it means a lot more than ' Just Buy The Shoes . ' It means ' Live Your Dreams . ' It means ' Make It Happen , Children Of the Earth Find The Courage To Go Out And Make The Most Out Of Life . ' I don ' t want that beautiful message of hope and inspiration tarnished by crass commercialism . " 	 1
A judge on Friday ruled against Arizona , dismissing its claims " in their entirety " against the federal government over its enforcement of immigration laws .The ruling by U . S . District Judge Susan Bolton is an apparent blow to Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer and her allies , who last year passed a controversial law known as SB 1070 .The Obama administration has challenged Arizona , claiming that enforcing immigration matters is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government . And in a separate ruling in July 2010 , Bolton blocked four key elements of the state legislation from taking effect including one requiring local police officers to check a person ' s immigration status while enforcing other laws .This past August , state officials filed a petition to overturn that ruling , with Brewer saying she wants the U . S . Supreme Court to decide the matter . Arizona has argued that the law aims to merely assist and cooperate with federal authorities , which it says Congress has blessed .The focus of Friday ' s ruling was Arizona ' s counterclaim to a federal lawsuit intent on blocking SB 1070 .Brewer released a statement Friday calling Bolton ' s latest decision " to dismiss Arizona ' s suit against the federal government . . . frustrating but not entirely surprising . "" It is but the latest chapter in a story that Arizonans know all too well : The federal government ignores its constitutional and statutory duty to secure the border . Federal courts avert their eyes . American citizens pay the price , " the statement said .Passed last year , the Arizona law aimed to " discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States . "In its counterclaims to the federal lawsuit , Arizona stated that Washington does not have " operational control " over the Arizona Mexico border , fails to protect Arizonans from invasion and domestic violence and hasn ' t lived up to its statutory responsibility to enforce immigration laws . Arizona also cited the 10th Amendment , which states that powers not delegated to federal authorities rest with the states .But Bolton wrote in her ruling that the " invasion clause protects against ' armed hostility from another political entity ' and does not permit Arizona to sue the federal government for its alleged failure to protect the state from unlawful immigration . " Bolton also said it is up to the political branch , not the courts , to decide if the " domestic violence clause " applies to the immigration debate .Arizona also argued that it faces greater costs due to what it calls federal authorities failure to properly address immigration including to " provide education , medical care and other benefits " to illegal immigrants in violation of the Tenth Amendment . "The judge countered , claiming " Arizona does not point to any federal immigration policy that mandates or compels Arizona to take action . "" The complained of expenditures arise entirely from Arizona ' s own policy choices and independent constitutional obligations and are not incurred as a result of any federal mandate . These state costs do not give rise to a claim under the Tenth Amendment , " she wrote .Arizona also alleged that the federal government " failed to comply with and enforce federal immigration law , " including a requirement that the U . S . Homeland Security department have " operational control " of the border and construct at least 700 miles of barriers .The judge found that these laws don ' t require " any discreet action ' with the clarity necessary to support judicial action , ' " noting that the term " operational control " is broad and that there are no deadlines for the fencing , infrastructure or other developments .In her statement following Bolton ' s ruling , Brewer vowed that the state ' s efforts on the matters would continue ." This decision makes it even more critical that the U . S . Supreme Court hear our defense of SB 1070 , " she said . " If the courts won ' t hold the federal government accountable as today ' s decision makes clear then states like Arizona need clarity in terms of the authority they have to combat illegal immigration .

Ukraine has officially declared Russia an " aggressor nation " and the fight in its east an " anti terrorist operation " .But Kiev has stopped short of calling it a " war , " and ties between them exist but are greatly reduced .Each escalation of the conflict , or the war of words between the countries , raises fears that the fighting will return to the massive bloodshed of earlier this year or , if allowed to spiral out of control , to an all out conflict .That explains the concern over the mud splattered electrical equipment in southern Ukraine .Renovation work has begun on one of the four trunk lines into Crimea .Maintenance workers re erected the pylon on Tuesday and the following day made preparations to raise the electrical cables .Cables were stretched and in some spots slightly lifted , but the labourers stopped short of hoisting them fully on to the pylons .This one line would restore up to 40 of Crimea ' s power supply , according to local reports . However , it is unknown when the power will finally be switched on .Image caption Maintenance workers re erected one main pylon and have begun the raise electricity cablesImage caption But there is no indication when the power will be turned back onThe explosions come after political activists mostly ethnic Crimean Tatars and members of the Right Sector ultranationalist group imposed a " blockade " on Crimea , to protest its annexation by Russia and reports of widespread human rights abuses there .This consisted of setting up checkpoints at the two main entry points into Crimea and stopping all cars and trucks trying to transport goods into the region ." I ' m protesting because in Crimea people can ' t live peacefully , " said Roman Ragozin , an activist wearing camouflage and the insignia of the Aidar volunteer military battalion ." They ' re being beaten , and are being searched in the middle of the night just because they support Ukraine . "Kiev officials said they understood the reasons behind the protest and did nothing to stop it , despite its extra legal character and reports that a number of the activists were using intimidation and force against motorists .Image caption Activists are keeping an eye on the workers , ensuring they do not complete their workJudging by the quiet at the site of the fallen electrical posts , the government ' s attitude towards the Crimean power outage seems to be similarly ambivalent .Police and protesters clashed on Saturday . However , by the middle of the week , all attempts to repair the remaining three pylons appeared to have been put on indefinite hold .A small group of protesters kept a watchful eye to make sure that authorities did not introduce any additional work beyond that on the first pylon . The government , for the moment , made no move to assert its authority .As a light , cold rain began to fall , the activists moved into a military tent they had set up and poured themselves some hot tea ." A deal will probably be reached to turn back on the electricity , " said Roman . " But I ' m against giving those separatists anything . " 	 0
the future in video games is usually depicted in one of two ways. there is the techno version of the future, filled with personal electronic implants, space travel and laser weapons. or there is the apocalyptic version, where a world has been bombed back into the stone age and somehow still has laser weapons. " call of duty : black ops ii, " the first person shooter game that hit stores tuesday, transports players into two separate time periods : the 1980s and the not so distant future of 2025. the relatively narrow time lapse was necessary to build a story around a new villain, raul menendez, a terrorist bent on revenge against a world he feels has wronged him. the battles in the 1980s will use traditional weaponry expected for the time. however, treyarch studio head mark lamia said the bigger challenge for the game's developers was creating futuristic tech for 2025 that would be both recognizable and unpredictable. " once you go beyond 10 years out, i think there is quite a bit of discussion about what does this mean, where do energy weapons come into play, where does ( artificial intelligence ) and advanced robotics go? " lamia said. the game is a sequel to 2010's " call of duty : black ops, " which sold more than 13. 7 million units in the u. s. alone to become one of the best selling console games of all time. for the new game, creators tapped author peter singer to help them imagine and design a world not too unlike the present day, but with a feel of advancement. singer is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the brookings institution whose book, " wired for war : the robotics revolution and conflict in the 21st century, " projected a vision of the future of war that developers were seeking. " we focused on everything from technical trends, the emergence of robotics, some of the greater attention to warfare, and then also political trends, " singer said. " the potential emergence of a proto cold war between the united states and china. " the two superpowers are competing over a valuable new resource the rare earth elements used in the construction of nearly all smartphones, tablets and other electronic gadgets. singer suggested this dwindling supply of rare earth elements could be a feasible backdrop for a new cold war. " i was not aware of the significance of them and we all educated ourselves and became quasi experts, " lamia said. " ( singer ) was more than our military consultant. he became our political consultant for the future. " review :'halo 4'is franchise's best yetsinger said the world is no longer just driven by the motives of countries but the actions of non state actors, such as terrorists or criminals. in creating a future for the new game, developers chose not the most likely scenario but one that is more entertaining for gaming purposes. " you're not just trying to identify what's likely and important, but also frankly, what's cool, " he said. " what gives you the most ground to cover... ( is it ) going to be cool for the gamers to play with? " as development was progressing, some of singer's projections for the future began appearing in the news. the game's creators were excited but a little unnerved to be building the future before it happened. referencing arthur c. clarke's third law " any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic " singer said the 2025 setting allows a familiarity with future technology that makes it seem more real. he tried to put his ideas into three different categories for developers. " ( first, ) it's here and it's being deployed in small numbers but you may not have heard about it, " singer said. " secondly, it's here but it's in prototype stage. it's in the stage where it is working somewhere, a lab, and we should expect to see it on the battlefield in the next coming years. " singer's third category includes tech that's still at the research stage and hasn't emerged into a viable, working form. this is where lamia and his team focused much of their effort. " we didn't want it to feel too sci fi. that was a term we used a lot, " lamia said. " we wanted it to feel grounded. it was also important on how it fit into the game. " lamia expected and planned for future tech to be smaller and more powerful, but singer pushed them into going farther with their thinking. lamia also told him the designs had to work within the game's narrative. " it isn't that we didn't want to take a leap of faith in mankind. you look at military technology and some things advance, but you see things that hang around for a while, " he said. " for example, there are a fair bit of weapons ( in the 	 0
LeBron James disagrees with Kevin Durant ' s stance that Kobe Bryant has been treated unfairly by mediaCleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James , left , and Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant are scheduled to play against one another twice before Bryant retires at the end of season . ( Mark J . Terrill , Associated Press )INDEPENDENCE , Ohio ? On Monday , Oklahoma City ? star Kevin Durant claimed the media has treated Lakers legend Kobe Bryant " like expletive " the last couple of years .Durant ' s ? candid comments were in response ? to the news Bryant had ? announced his retirement at season ' s end . It caught most by surprise .After Tuesday ' s shootaround for tonight ' s game against ? Washington , Cavaliers star LeBron James was asked for his take , and he wholeheartedly disagreed ." I think the media has done a great job of building ? Kobe as who he is today , " he said . " There ' s no reason for me to say that the media has made him ( Kobe ) look a certain way throughout his career . "Durant , who has been anti media of late for some odd reason , didn ' t change his tune when local reporters ? asked for his thoughts on what Bryant meant to the league and to him personally ." I ' ve been disappointed this year because you guys treated him like expletive , " Durant said . " He ' s a legend , and all I hear is about how bad he ' s playing , how bad he ' s shooting and it ' s time for him to hang it up . You guys treated one of our legends like expletive , and I didn ' t really like it . So hopefully now you can start being nice to him now that he decided to retire after this year . "Durant ' s ? resentment toward the media also surfaced in New York during last season ' s All Star game in February . He let it be known he had no interest in fielding questions at a league mandated press availability ." To be honest , man , I ' m only here talking to y ' all because I have to , " Durant said . " So I really don ' t care . Y ' all not my friends . You ' re going to write what you want to write . You ' re going to love us one day and hate us the next . That ' s a part of it . So I just learn how to deal with y ' all . "James , on the other hand , is the opposite . He is the most accessible superstar in the league by far ? and ? understands the role and the importance of media .There are really good media members and some poor ones , but James doesn ' t paint them all with a broad brush . As a whole , he ? believes ? Bryant was covered fairly ." ( Kobe ' s ) done unbelievable things and part of the reason why he ' s big as he is because obviously the work he ' s put into it , but also the coverage that we all get from you guys , " James said . " So , I don ' t see it that way . And I don ' t really get involved in that side of things , but I don ' t see it that way . " 	 0
HOLLYWOOD Word out of LaLaLand is that the Epitome Television Network has just cancelled The Vampire Threesome .According to Tittle Tattle Tonight ' s Pico de Gallo there were several reasons why the vampire show which starred Paris Hilton , Russell Brand , and Chelsea Handler was cancelled .The shows director Durango Grundyweather dropped out of the show two weeks ago after the false quasi molestation charges which were leveled by Paris Hilton .Grundyweather stated that Hilton visited him in his on set trailer wearing the skimpiest bikini swimsuit he had ever seen . He said that as the two were talking about the script she conveniently fell onto his lap .He asked her what in the world she was doing and she giggled and replied that she had lost her equatorial .EDITOR ' S NOTE : I ' m sure that the spacey blonde actually meant to say equilibrium .One of the shows stunt women , identified as Madonna " Lips " Pickwick , said that another factor that contributed to the shows cancellation was the fact that the shows other blonde cast member Chelsea Handler has a vampire phobia and she is allergic to vampire cloaks , garlic clusters , and hanging bats .The talented stunt woman stated that Handler ' s allergic reaction causes her left nipple to enlarge to four times the normal size while her right nipple amazingly stays the same standard size .Pickwick also brought out the fact that the shows male co star Russell Brand is alleged to have suffered some bothersome mouth cuts due to the fake vampire fangs he was required to wear .Brand confided to Paris that the cuts caused him so much pain that he had to drink down shot after shot of Johnnie Walker Black , which of course then impaired his acting abilities .SIDENOTE : The Epitome Television Network expressed that in the meantime The Vampire Threesome time slot will be filled with reruns of The Muffin Makers . 	 1
Political candidates for the office of The President of The United States from both parties issued their predictions on which teams would go to the Super Bowl today . While some admitted to not being the greatest of sports fans , all were eager to support the team from their home state ( or the area that they were campaigning in at the moment ) .Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton thought that the New York Yankees would probably play against the Boston Celtics because " one of the two of those teams has historically won it all . " When told that these were , respectively , a baseball and basketball team and the Super Bowl was for football , she replied " so which one is that ? "Illinois Senator Barrack Obama was quick to choose his Chicago Bears and the Dolphins ( he was campaigning at a AARP convention in Miami Beach ) . When told that the Dolphins had yet to win a game , he quickly asked his campaign manager where he was speaking at the next day . He changed his answer to " The New Orleans Saints " ( another impossible team as they are in the same conference as the Bears ) .Senator John Edwards answered that " when I was growing up as a poor white child in the south , we couldn ' t afford a football . In fact , because I was the smallest child in the neighborhood , they used me as the football . That ' s why my program to help the poor and underpriv . . . . . . "Governor Bill Richardson responded by saying that " I was drafted by teams in the old AFL and NFL . I think that I ' d have to support the teams that drafted me . . . the Dallas Texans and the Los Angeles Rams . " When told that these teams were now , respectively , the Kansas City Chiefs and the St . Louis Rams , and reminded that he had never been drafted in football ( he has always lied that he was drafted in baseball ) , Richardson had no comment .On the Republican side , projections were little better .Mike Huckabee , Governor of Arkansas , selected the University of Arkansas Razorbacks and Arkansas Little Rock to play in the big game . When told that these were college , and not professional , teams , Huckabee was upset . " What do you mean they ' re not professional ? I ' ve given those players enough money and cars over the years that they sure are professional . "Rudy Giuliani , former Mayor of New York , quickly answered that the New York Giants and New York Jets would probably be in the big game this year . When told that the Jets were mathematically eliminated from even reaching the playoffs , he quicly asked which teams Hillary Clinton had picked .Mitt Romney , Governor of Massachusetts , chose the New England Patriots ( the only undefeated team thus far this season and one projected to make the Super Bowl ) . His other guess , however , was BYU .Ron Paul was too old to remember what football was and had to be woken up for lunch and to have his depends changed .Other presidential candidates had too few votes and too little support even to count , so we didn ' t ask them . 	 1
HOLLYWOOD Former superstar and alleged child molester Michael Jackson was rushed to the emergency room again with what doctors ultimately diagnosed as flu like symptoms . He was immediately admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment but is not expected to fully recover until 5 : 00 p . m . Friday afternoon .When reached for comment , Jackson told reporters that he was feeling much better but he feared an ingrown toenail he had been suffering from for some time would become infected the following Monday morning . He shared with journalists that his psychic had predicted the problem would quickly escalate into a serious need for amputation of his pinkie toe , with full bed rest required until the end of May ." This is greatly upsetting to me , " said Jackson , currently undergoing treatment for a back injury brought on by excessive flu medication , " because all I want to do right now is go court and prove my innocence against the false charges that have been brought against me . "Jackson urged friends and well wishers not to harbor unneeded concern even though it is a widely known fact that Jackson contracts serious pleurisy at the beginning of every June . This normally slightly painful malady is no cause for alarm in most cases but Jackson has a particularly devastating form of the sickness that causes necrotizing fasciitis .Before this revelation was made public , many Michael fans believed that he was addicted to plastic surgery , and they were shocked when the truth came to light ." All this time I thought he suffered body dysmorphic disorder , " said close friend and celebrity socialite , Jocelyn Wildenstein . " Now I have learned that poor Michael actually contracts a flesh eating disease triggered by his yearly pleurisy , and he must undergo multiple surgeries every August to look even close to normal . "In the past , Michael ' s cosmetic surgery procedures have seldom caused him any debilitating effects save having to appear in public wearing a surgical mask , but doctors are now speculating that his current flu like symptoms might cause him to be forced to remain in a germ free environment until Halloween ." That poor man , " said Wildenstein . " Just as he recovers from one malady , he experiences another . "As a service to both his fans and the court , Jackson has ordered his attorneys to make public heretofore confidential health records noting the many ailments and harsh physical horrors he suffers annually . In those records , it is noted that Jackson also harbors a genetic disorder commonly known as dance fever brought on each September by allergies to mold spores . Prone to flailing seizures during that time , the fragile Jackson must be hospitalized and kept isolated until at least New Year ' s Day ." After that , we just don ' t know , " said a member of Jackson ' s law firm . " January is flu season and Michael ' s health is so fragile . We ' ll just have to keep our fingers crossed that the trial will resume by next February . "Doctors at the hospital expressed concern over the singer ' s physical and financial health as rumors continue to circulate that Jackson has run out of money . An anonymous source said Jackson ' s Neverland ATM has not been restocked since mid February ." He ' s even out of Jesus juice , " said a close friend name withheld by request . " We ' re all very worried about his health . " 	 1

Sing in the shower , not in public . That ' s the message to anyone visiting one South Carolina beach community .The town of Sullivan ' s Island has proposed an ordinance that would make it illegal to belt out show tunes , pop songs , or any musical notes , for that matter , if they disturb the peace ." I haven ' t had one islander complain about it , " said Andy Benke , the town administrator . " There are places where you can go and be loud and vociferous . Sullivan ' s Island is not one of them . "" We want you to have a good time but in the same sense we want you to act respectful and if you don ' t we have a tool to deal with it , " Benke added .That tool would be a ticket from a police officer for a maximum fine of 500 . And the ban isn ' t just for singing .The measure reads as follows :" It shall be unlawful for any person to yell , shout , hoot , whistle , or sing on the public streets , particularly between the hours of 11 : 00 p . m . and 7 : 00 a . m . or at any time or place so as to annoy or disturb the comfort , or repose of persons in any office , or in any dwelling , or other type of residence , or of any persons in the vicinity . "The town , which is on a barrier island just north of Charleston Harbor , has a population of about 2 , 000 but swells to around 5 , 000 during summer weekends , Benke said . He called it " first and foremost a single residential community ." There are a lot of visitors to the beach 24 hours a day , " he said , " and we just need a way to maintain the quiet family atmosphere . "The town council has already voted two times for the ordinance and after a third vote in July , it is expected to be put into effect in August , Benke said .He said the welcome mat is always open for people to enjoy the town but made it clear loud , disruptive noises , including public singing during quiet hours , will not be tolerated ." There are probably six or seven little restaurants in the town that stay open until 2 a . m . , " he said . " People are leaving , ( having ) had a good time all night . Maybe they don ' t know they are being loud and think it ' s okay . But it ' s not . " 	 0
From watermelon lovers to monster sixes , these are the most exciting , silly and downright crazy plays in the sporting world this week .The first round of the NFL playoffs are surprising , hairy and you simply cannot look away .The trick is picking which games to watch and which to skip because , let ' s face it , you have a life and , if last year is any guide , only two of the four games will be really close .In an oddity this year , both AFC games will take place on Saturday ( Sunday AEDT ) , with the NFC taking over Sunday . Here ? is ? a ? guide to prioritising the playoffs :Can they do it again ? : Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers will be looking to continue Cincinnati ' s post season misery .1 . Cincinnati Bengals ? v Pittsburgh Steelers , Saturday , 8 . 15 pm ?

The Bengals won ? 16 10 ? in Pittsburgh and the Steelers took the second game ? 33 20 ? in Cincy .What makes it special : The Steelers , widely billed by pundits as the team no one wants to play in the post season , went 6 2 over the second half of the season and advanced by winning a wild card with help from the Buffalo Bills .Still , everyone who has ever waved a terrible towel will remind you that they were a wild card team the last time they won the Super Bowl .Running back DeAngelo Williams may be have an ankle injury , but when has a hobbled star ( See Roethlisberger , Ben ) ever kept the Steelers from winning big games ? If Williams can ' t play , Fitzgerald Toussaint will be the featured back .The Bengals hate history lessons : The Bengals may have the home field advantage for this game , but there ' s uncertainty at quarterback and a fairly significant piece of history they ' re fighting .Andy Dalton , who broke his hand against the Steelers , is now out of his cast , but his availability for Sunday is in doubt .The offence , coach Marvin Lewis said , will be run by A .

orlando, fl continuing a tradition that stretches back to his early years with the miami heat, magic head coach stan van gundy routinely presents his players with classic barbecue cookbooks to inspire them and provide insights during road trips. during the team's long west coast swing in december, dwight howard was given barbecue america : a pilgrimage in search of america's best barbecue, while vince carter was seen reading cheryl jamison's 400 page tome sublime smoke : bold new flavors inspired by the old art of barbecue. and in a clear attempt to get j. j. redick to tap into the success of his duke playing days, van gundy gave the magic guard paul kirk's championship barbecue sauces : 175 make your own sauces, marinades, dry rubs, wet rubs, mops, and salsas. but for their upcoming three game sojourn away from the friendly confines of amway arena, the spiritual van gundy known throughout the league as a barbecue pit master bucked the tradition of handing out personalized volumes and made the unorthodox choice of giving all his players the same book to read : ray lampe's dr bbq's big time barbecue cookbook. " our guys need to have a singular mind set. they need to understand the oneness that can be achieved between man and slow cooked, mouthwatering meats, " van gundy told reporters over three dozen hot wings at wing zone, a downtown orlando eatery, tuesday. " this book is written by a true champion, someone who can give our players the courage and insight they need to smoke an entire pig for a feast that family and friends will never forget. " " and, um, make a title run, " added van gundy, reaching for more napkins. throughout his six year head coaching career, van gundy has separated himself from his colleagues not just with his impressive record, but with a zen like commitment to getting his players to think about the world of barbecue in a different way. orlando magic players have said that van gundy is always finding new ways to motivate his team, whether showing them inspirational footage of his 23 year old self receiving his official barbecue competition judge's certificate, or canceling practice altogether to take them to a classic kansas city rib joint. during their victory over the lakers last sunday, van gundy called a timeout for a quick meditation and breathing session, encouraging his players to remember the aroma of the plate of brisket he ate during halftime. " he preaches patience, " guard jason williams said. " whenever we're rushing things on offense, he'll always tell us to slow down and imagine the poise and control it took for some of the country's greatest barbecue chefs to infuse their pork rib slabs with a handcrafted spice blend, refrigerate them in marinade for 12 hours, massage them, and then patiently cooking them'low and slow'for another 10 hours at 250 degrees. " van gundy reportedly promised his team that dr bbq's big time barbecue cookbook will force them to step outside themselves and ask metaphysical questions about the cooking style, such as : what is the true difference between grilling and barbecuing? what is the best barbecue smoker to buy, and how do i use it to its full potential? when can you trust your own instincts to predict a beef brisket's marbleization, and when do you enlist the wisdom of others? and most importantly, what are the secrets to becoming a true barbecue champion? " van gundy said he believes the 320 page volume will help his team reach a state of barbecue enlightenment. " there are some parts that are a little tough to wade through, like when dr bbq talks about the difference between cooking over logs and charcoal, but there's a saying : open a book, open your mind, " van gundy told reporters. " and i think the message of this book is that you can achieve your dreams without spending thousands of dollars on a high end grill or barbecue pit. " " in here, " van gundy said while holding the sauce stained book, " are lessons they will never forget. " " it's helpful, " said forward matt barnes, noting that the book had inspired more than a few locker room discussions. " it certainly got me thinking in ways i wouldn't have otherwise. but i don't know if i believe in all that mumbo jumbo, especially the stuff about aluminum foil ruining the bark of the meat. " though van gundy's methods have been effective, he says that he hasn't let his reputation as a pit guru go to his head. in his office, a message tacked to his wall reads : " there are no barbecue masters. there is only masterful barbecue. " "'barbecue master'is a contradiction, " van gundy said. " no one 	 1
detectives working to find missing madeleine mccann have given their counterparts in portugal a new list of potential suspects and have urged them to investigate themmore than 20 new suspects in the madeleine mccann investigation have been identified by british police. a scotland yard review of the bungled portuguese inquiry into the three year old's disappearance in 2007 has uncovered dozens of fresh leads, it emerged yesterday. they include'forensic opportunities'and several'people of interest ', including britons, who have not been eliminated from the case. madeleine's parents, kate and gerry mccann, are said to be'greatly encouraged'by the developments. but the mail has learned that behind the scenes, a major diplomatic row is brewing because the portuguese authorities are adamant they will not reopen the inquiry. officials in lisbon have told their british counterparts that under portuguese laws, they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence. but yard chiefs who want the portuguese to agree to a joint investigation say their new leads could, if properly explored, result in new evidence and possibly the maddie mystery being solved. one well placed source described the deadlock as'a mexican stand off '.'it's a chicken and egg situation. significant new evidence can be found if the leads uncovered by the yard are investigated. there are two major obstacles to a joint investigation : the money to fund it in portugal and the loss of face they would suffer from having to agree to such an inquiry.'it is understood high level discussions have taken place in the uk about the possibility of scotland yard launching its own investigation. british police don't have jurisdiction in portugal, but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any british suspects linked to madeleine's disappearance. still hopeful : mrs mccann returned to portugal this month with her mother, susan healy, six years onthis picture shows kate and gerry mccann marking the fifth anniversary of their daughter's disappearance with an'aged'photo of how she might look on the sixth anniversary this year they said they'd not given upshould the met decide to launch its own investigation, it is likely to send a formal letter of request to the portuguese authorities seeking its assistance in its inquiries. last night a yard spokesman confirmed a high level delegation of officers travelled to portugal in march, but he refused to comment on what discussions took place. the senior detective who has overseen the met's two year review of the case yesterday confirmed his officers had drawn up a list of people who they say are'of interest '. detective chief superintendent hamish campbell, the head of scotland yard's homicide and serious crime command, said there were a'good number'of individuals who should be questioned. he would not disclose the precise number but sources told the mail that at least 20 potential suspects including a number of britons who were in the algarve at the time of madeleine's disappearance six years ago had not been properly eliminated. mr campbell urged the portuguese authorities to investigate the new leads. he said :'there are a lot of people of interest. there are people who could be properly explored further, if only to be eliminated.'madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in praia da luz in portugal in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby. the shambolic portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008 but scotland yard launched a home office funded review of the case in 2011 following the intervention of david cameron. last year the officer in day to day charge of the review, detective chief inspector andy redwood, said his team had identified 195 potential leads after examining a huge bundle of material. mr campbell said it was'perfectly probable'that information which could identify the suspect responsible for madeleine's disappearance was already in the portuguese files. he reiterated a claim that madeleine could still be alive. he said :'you only have to look at the case in cleveland, ohio, and the european cases. of course there is a possibility she is alive.'but the key is to investigate the case and, alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.'the mccanns, of rothley, leicestershire, have been kept closely informed of scotland yard's review codenamed operation grange over the past two years. a spokesman for the couple said :'they have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry.'a source close to the couple said :'while they don't want to raise their hopes too much, they are buoyed up by these revelations.'a home office source said :'clearly not all the 20 potential suspects identified by the met could be responsible for madeleine's disappearance. but the yard are adamant that if they were running the inquiry here, these people would have been properly eliminated.'the ocean club resort in praia da luz in the algarve from where madeleine mccann was abducted 	 0
a fraudster who won a contract from new york city to clean up after ebola grossly exaggerated his experience after'scamming'the grieving relatives of a haz mat expert, a new report claims. salvatore pane, 32, the chief safety officer of bio recovery corporation, was called in when dr craig spencer was diagnosed with ebola to eradicate the disease from places he'd been. photographs of him taping perimeters around spencer's harlem apartment, handling barrels of waste and speaking to news crews were beamed around the world, while in interviews he boasted of having 27 years'experience and took credit for cleaning up after anthrax attacks in the wake of 9 11. public face of ebola cleanup : salvatore pane, pictured setting up a perimeter around an active ebola cleanup, reportedly'scammed'relatives of a dead haz mat professional to get into the trusted positionriding to the rescue : pane appeared on television and radio interviews in the wake of the cleanup, and his image was beamed across the world. bio recovery, the company he is associated with, has not been given any work by new york city since pane's past emergedin front of camera, behind bars : in 2010 11 pane was serving jail time for drunk driving. he was also fined in connection a company which took advantage of people struggling with mortgages in the credit crunchbut, according to an investigation by buzzfeed news, pane has a criminal history, a track record of exaggerating credentials, and during the clean up was using vehicles and permits registered to a dead man, whose family now feel'scammed '. on october 24, the day after dr spencer was diagnosed with ebola, pane was on the scene at his west 147th street home, and also at the gutter bowling alley in williamsburg, where spencer visited the night before. he gave interviews to tv news explaining his work, and went out of his way to bring up how'we'cleaned up after an anthrax attack in 2001, the week after 9 11. but shortly after his heroic turn, buzzfeed news published an expos, revealing that in 2008 he had been president of a company that claimed to helped customers trapped by distressed mortgages, and fleeced them of their fees. media darling : in a photograph posted on bio recovery's facebook page, pane is interviewed by a reporter from nbcan injunction was issued against pane's businesses and he himself was fined. it was also revealed that pane had served time in jail for driving while drunk even getting himself re arrested outside a courthouse after driving himself to the case while his licence. in the wake of the revelation, city hall officials in new york distances themselves from pane and bio recovery, and said he would be getting no more work from them. there is no suggestion that pane who changed his name to pain after getting out of jail in march 2011 did not complete the ebola clean up properly. but now more detail has emerged about how pane came to be in a position to be entrusted with defending new yorkers from a potential pandemic. city hall has said that bio recovery had been doing jobs for them on and off over the past six years when the company was founded by former paramedic ron gospodarski in 1998. gospodarski ran the reputable company until he got sick 2013 and died. in his will he left the company to fran gospodarski senko, his sister. gospodarski senko told buzzfeed how pane called her out of the blue months after her brother died, claiming to be a business associate. he asked for passwords to accounts and negotiated buying an ambulance and a box truck he had used, which featured haz mat permits which he claimed were almost identical to his own. he later followed up by asking her sell him the company itself, to save on costly bureaucracy and administration. gospodarski senko recalled him saying :'if you just sign the corporation over, it'll save me money.'although no official records show pane as the owner, former employees claim he was clearly the boss, and said that he deliberately kept his name off any official records because of his past. nonetheless, he went on to continue bio recovery's line of work, and boasted in interviews of having'27 year's experience'which would have meant his bio hazard career began aged four. employees and associates of gospodarski all say they had never heard of pane until recently. after seeing pane claim credit for the company her brother built, gospodarski senko said she felt'stupid'for trusting him. she told buzzfeed :'i can't even grieve for my brother,'she said,'and he's out there pulling my corporation from underneath my nose. 	 0

gorkha, nepal the ride from kathmandu to near the epicenter of nepal's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick. steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. the view along the six hour journey from the capital is deceptive. although i see numerous landslides, i am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected. during the entire journey, i notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses. one of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas. one of them is gorkha, a district northwest of kathmandu. the town we were visiting looks intact. some houses have cracks, and i see a few collapsed brick walls. most of the shops and businesses are open. but our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe. the hospital campus is overflowing with patients. the facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity. the injured are not from the town of gorkha, which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges. they are from northern part of the district, where some 200, 000 people live. to accommodate all the casualties, the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot. at a time of our arrival, there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor. the youngest is 10, the oldest in his 70s. most of them have visible wounds : deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. all of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering. mita gurung, 10, sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of sinjung partially collapsed. her mother was injured in the tremor. mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor tara may bishakarma. " i just found what she likes and keep repeating it. her injuries are fairly superficial, but she is traumatized. it will take some time, but she will recover, " bishakarma says. children usually get excited when being filmed. mita seems almost unaware of my camera. little food, less optimism in kathmandu tent citythe situation in the hospital's emergency room is similar. every bed is taken. all the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses. some have family members with them. despite the gravity of the situation, the atmosphere here is calm. gorkha's hospital is ill equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point. here, the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in kathmandu. there are not enough ambulances, and most of the injured must travel on old buses. people unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers. i cannot even imagine traveling on the road we just came in with a broken leg or a spinal injury. the caws of crows above gorkha are frequently interrupted by sounds of helicopters. we leave the hospital and go to check the landing zones. one is a sports field, and the second a flat meadow on the ridge. many of the damaged villages are not accessible by roads. to fly to most remote places from gorkha takes about 30 minutes, five days on foot. the helicopters operated by nepalese military bring tents, tarps, blankets, food and baby supplies to most damaged areas. they bring back the injured. one helicopter brings two stranded danish tourists from chumchet, a village in the tsum valley. they are in a group of 11 trekkers from slovakia, poland and the czech republic who remain in the valley. most of the helicopters are small and can only pick up two to three passengers. we head back to the hospital, where we meet olivier hagon. he is the head of a mission of the swiss humanitarian aid unit, a swiss government agency. the agency's " mother and child " team helps the needy during disasters around the world. " for us, it's most important to focus on the most vulnerable ones : mothers and children. women in labor who don't have a bed, women in need of a cesarean ( section ) without access to surgery facilities, " says hagon. the rest of the 10 member unit arrives from kathmandu in the evening. the team includes a pediatrician, a pediatric surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, a midwife, an anesthesiologist and a gynecologist. within two hours, they set up two modern fully functioning operating theaters at the hospital. the group's philosophy is " to support, not to invade. " they work very closely with staff of gorkha's hospital. the swiss 	 0
The scene was reminiscent of a European Cup soccer final as hundreds of scientists leapt into the air screaming and shouting and hugging each other as sheaves of paper drifted through the air .It all happened at their research centre in Geneva at the critical moment when they first heard the incredible news .Most of the activities at CERN are currently directed towards operating the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , and the costly experiments designed for it . Twenty countries foot the annual bill for running the collider eighteen of them EEC members .It lies in a tunnel 27 kilometres in circumference , 175 metres ( 574 ft ) beneath the Franco Swiss border near Geneva , Switzerland . It is also the largest machine ever built .The first beam was circulated through the collider on the morning of 10 September 2008 . The second beam , scheduled for six minutes after three that afternoon , was suspended due to the Project Control Manager Herr Otto Von Kryon having to ' cry off ' due to an unexpected bout of chronic diarrhoea . It was rumoured he had ingested contaminated lobster for lunch .And what was the reason for this morning ' s euphoria ? After years of struggle they had at last found what they call " The God Particle " .Our reporter from " Delusional Eggheads ' Monthly " visited Herr Kryon at his mansion just outside of Lucerne to hear more about this earth shattering discovery .Q : Can you explain more about the God particle ? A : It is difficult . The particle has inhuman intelligence . It directs the logical arrangements of all forms of matter in the universe . It controls evolution . And makes damn good wine if I may say so . It is what we have called hitherto Dark Matter . Q : So the God Particle is really God ? A : Yes , the God Particle is everywhere and nowhere . It is a singularity . It creates and directs all energy in the cosmos . It is God . Q : Really ? And what do you propose to do next ? A : We are going to make Him an offer He cannot refuse . 	 1
WASHINGTON , DC Confusion and disbelief reigned at the White House after President Bush announced Monday that an Arizona man , known to authorities only as H4xX0r1337 , stole his identity and used it to buy electronic goods , veto a bill , and meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox ." This is incredibly frustrating , " Bush told reporters Tuesday . " Not only does this guy have my credit card information , he has my Social Security number , all my personal information , and the launch codes for a number of ballistic intercontinental nuclear missiles . I almost don ' t want to think about it . "" I feel so violated , " Bush added .Bush said he has canceled his credit cards and changed the national security codes , but he labeled the process a " total nightmare . "" It ' s a huge ordeal , " Bush said . " Everything will be straightened out eventually , but my credit rating and political capital are down the tubes . I asked the FBI , and they aren ' t even sure how long this guy ' s had my identity . For all I know , he ' s started up his own oil refinery somewhere in Alaska . "Bush said he began to suspect something was wrong when he received a card from Sen . Bill Frist , thanking him for vetoing the Digital Media Consumers ' Rights Act of 2005 ." I thought I was going crazy , " Bush said . " I had no recollection of even reading that piece of legislation , much less killing it . At first , I thought Frist had things mixed up , but I checked the records , and sure enough , someone with my credentials came into the White House in late March while I was on my ranch and vetoed that bill . "Bush said he only recognized the full magnitude of the problem last Tuesday , when Mexican President Fox called to thank him for the " incredibly positive and productive summit . "" Vicente said I had agreed to an aid package for his country , " Bush said . " It was like I was in cuckoo land . That ' s when I called FBI Director Robert Mueller . I said , ' You may want to sit down for this one , Bob . I think someone stole my identity . ' "According to Mueller , examining Bush ' s recent outgoing e mail led him to believe that the president ' s identity was probably stolen about five weeks ago , when he responded to an e mail from paypal783 hotmail . com asking him to comply with PayPal security measures by entering all 12 of his credit card numbers , his Social Security number , his passwords , and his personal identification numbers ." It appears that the president is among the many thousands of Americans who have fallen for so called ' phishing ' scams , " Mueller said . " One should never give out sensitive personal information in response to an e mail . If the president had read the memo we sent out a few months ago , he would have known that . "Although the FBI has traced H4xX0r1337 ' s now defunct ISP account to a Mail Boxes , Etc . mailbox in Tempe , AZ , Mueller said apprehending H4xX0r1337 may prove more difficult ." Identity thieves and hackers are notoriously difficult to locate , " Mueller said . " They are often highly intelligent and very skilled at covering their tracks . Making it more difficult , H4xX0r1337 seems to have used his credentials to commandeer Air Force One . At this moment , he could be anywhere in the world . "Bush said he will likely need to spend the entire week reclaiming his identity , adding that he wished to thank everyone who has already assisted him in the process ." The FBI has been working tirelessly to find this man who hides in the shadows and perpetrates computer terrorism , " Bush said . " I ' d also like to thank Debrina at Bank One ' s customer service center . She was very courteous and super helpful . "This is not the first time a hacker has stolen the identity of a political figure . In February 2004 , police arrested Columbus , OH ' s HotGrrrl69 after the 16 year old was caught campaigning for John Kerry while posing as Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D CA ) . 	 1
EL PASO , TX In an effort to beef up security measures along the U . S . Mexican border , the U . S . Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Monday that the border will soon be fortified with 1 , 200 miles of pure beef ." America has drawn a line in the sand , " INS official Frank Wilhelm said . " And that line is made of meat . "According to Wilhelm , the immense , 15 foot high wall of pure beef , which will extend from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico along the Rio Grande , will make border crossing all but impossible ." This beef will be cooked sizzling hot , so hot that it will be extremely painful to climb over , " said INS chief Kent Roker . " And even if a Mexican does get across , they will be so full that they won ' t run far . "Just this morning , Ciudad Ju rez , Mexico , resident Jorge Gutierrez , 43 , a poor , unskilled laborer who had managed to successfully climb over the beef barrier , was found by Texas state troopers sitting by the side of the road , holding his belly , picking his teeth , and moaning , " Aye , caramba , am I stuffed ! "Border Patrol authorities described Gutierrez ' s condition as " full , " adding that the would be immigrant did not run or hide when spotted , due to sleepiness and lethargy induced by consumption of enormous quantities of beef .Gutierrez was treated at nearby Santa Maria Hospital for indigestion and extensive second degree grease burns given new clothes and then turned over to INS authorities for deportation .Those who , unlike Gutierrez , do manage to escape are " easily tracked " by INS dog teams , specially trained to follow the scent of the spicy , mouth watering seasonings the federal government stirs into the sizzling hot beef wall twice daily ." This is real beef , for real Americans , " INS official Ted Stake said . " Most of your foreigner types just don ' t have the stomach for that much hearty , lip smacking meat , living as they do on subsistence diets of tortillas and beans . "Though the beef wall already has had an enormous effect , reducing the number of illegal entries to the U . S . by 35 percent over the last week alone , the project has not been without its costs ." The harsh climate of the Southwestern U . S . is largely inhospitable to perishables such as the grease slathered mounds of meat used in the beef shield , " said Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Joseph Timmins . " Temperatures along the Rio Grande can reach 110 degrees in the shade on a typical afternoon , and for an operation like this , that means one thing : spoilage . "At present , the U . S . is spending over 22 billion per week to deliver massive rail shipments of fresh beef to the border three times a day . Budget constraints have necessitated the elimination of a planned 75 trillion grease trap to catch the runoff from the beef barrier ' s massive hot plate base . Currently , every 60 seconds , 300 tons of congealed grease are dumped directly into the Rio Grande , with environmental damage in the last week alone estimated at 759 billion ." That much beef is a tall order , " Timmins said . " But that ' s how we do things here in the good old U . S . of A . big , meaty and ready to take on even the hungriest of hombres . So bring it on , illegal aliens : Let ' s just see if you ' ve got the stomach to take on this much hot American beef . "Timmins concluded his remarks by holding up a forkful of ground beef , placing it next to his mouth , and smiling directly at the asssembled press , saying : " Mmm . . . beef ! " 	 1
Members of Congress have lashed out against the U . S . Secret Service after an investigation showed that the elite agency spent an average of just 25 minutes on training for each of its officers in 2013 , a situation investigators called ' unacceptable 'Officers in other law enforcement agencies spent up to one fourth of their on the job time in training during the same year .In previous years the Secret Service had sent special agents through as many as eight training classes . But between 2012 and 2013 , it offered just one .' We all are in agreement the levels are unacceptably low , ' said Danielle Gray , one of the investigators who testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform committee .Members of the Secret Service Protective Mission Panel ( L R ) Mark Filip , Danielle Gray , Thomas Perrelli and Joseph Hagin told members of Congress the elite agency is in disarray and can ' t train its agents appropriatelyJoseph Clancy , the aegncy ' s acting director , is favored by the Whte House to keep his job permanently even as investigators recommend an outsider to reform the Secret ServicePanelists said the Secret Service is in need of more outside leadership , while President Barack Obama is hinting that he wants acting director Joseph P . Clancy to keep the job personally .Clancy is the ultimate insider , with a resume that includes several years at the helm of the agency ' s presidential protection division until his retirement in 2011 .He was appointed to fill a vacancy at the top of the agency ' s pyramid when Julia Pierson resigned last year , following a series of embarrassing security lapses .GovExec reported that the investigation concluded with recommendations to add new personnel to correct the training deficit 200 new uniformed officers and 85 new special agents . One panelist said those new hires might be just a ' down payment ' on a larger hiring binge .but Republicans on the committee doubt more spending will right the ship .The Secret Service already employs 6 , 300 people and Congress has over funded it during the last two years , providing more money than it asked for .The newly formed U .

manchester, nh returning to work after seven days off, derek olson, 31, confessed monday that his plan to use his weeklong vacation to straighten out his life yielded mixed results. " this was the week all the shit i'd been putting off for years big and small was going to get done, " said olson, a data entry operator at a. g. edwards sons. " from getting steve and kim a gift for their wedding two months ago to going through all those boxes i'd left unpacked since moving here in'98 to finally deciding what my future is with girlfriend melanie stirre, it was all going to get taken care of. " " i did pay my gas bill, " olson continued, " but then i lost the envelope somewhere on the way to the mailbox, so now i have to wait for a second notice. " after using last saturday and sunday the first two days of his break to recover from " a shitstorm of a work week, " olson decided he would begin straightening up his life first thing monday morning. " i thought that if i didn't rest up over the weekend, i'd burn out halfway through my week off, " said olson, explaining the slow start. " saturday night, i did write up a list of what i wanted to accomplish over the course of the coming week, but it wasn't really all that complete. " among the goals written on the abbreviated list : a thorough cleaning of his apartment, laundry, re ordering of checks, buying a bigger cd shelf, signing up for a t'ai chi course, cashing in a large jar of loose change at the bank, updating his resume, looking for a new job, and " figuring out the whole melanie thing. " olson's plan to straighten out his life first thing monday morning was derailed the evening prior. " i was going to go to bed early sunday so i could get up early monday and start on all my projects, " olson said. " but then i realized i could go to rocky's bar grill, where they have this really cool thing called rocky's sunday night record jam, where this guy spins all these really cool old vinyl records, everything from curtis mayfield to the damned. i normally never get to go because i have to get up at 6 a. m. mondays, so i figured it was my big chance. but then i got a little more drunk than i'd planned. " upon waking up monday, a hung over olson decided it would be a " day of recovery " and vowed to begin first thing tuesday. after spending most of tuesday in his bathrobe re reading harry potter and the chamber of secrets, olson finally went to the basement that evening to begin the first of his many projects. " i decided the first thing i was going to do was unpack all the stuff in the basement, " olson said. " when i opened the first box marked'magazines,'it had nothing but a bunch of socks and my electric pencil sharpener. i got so pissed off with my lack of organization, i went back upstairs and started watching tv. " having accomplished only a few tasks wednesday and thursday, olson knew he would have to " really bear down " friday. " i actually would've gotten a lot of stuff done friday if the whole universe hadn't been against me, " olson said. " i took my car in to get my tires rotated, but the guy said he couldn't get to it until the following tuesday, so i was like,'screw that.'i also went to staples to pick up the computer desk i'd had on layaway for the last month, but i forgot to bring my receipt. they wouldn't give the stupid thing to me, even after arguing with the guy for almost an hour. the whole day was a colossal waste. except i got a new belt i needed for work. " after devoting friday night to drinking to unwind from the computer desk episode, a once again hung over olson spent most of saturday re alphabetizing his cds, a task he did not plan to take on during his week off but needed to be done. sunday was spent fretting over the wasted week and berating himself for not going to new orleans a trip he'd strongly considered taking before committing to staying home and getting his life in order. " next year, i'm definitely going to new orleans, " olson said. " this was stupid. " according to corporate consultant and motivational speaker jeffrey hatcher, trying to catch up on years of neglected goals in one week is not a good strategy. " you have to make a conscious effort every day, " hatcher said. " you can't spend years letting things fall apart and then fix it all in seven days. it's just not possible. perhaps if derek had had two weeks off, he might have been able 	 1

it started with sinus congestion for shawna coronado. then the splitting migraines came. coronado soon discovered the furry causes : harrington and kalamazoo. shawna coronado endures headaches and congestion to keep her 30 pound pug, harrington. her 30 pound pug and orange tabby scattered dead skin flakes around the house, triggering coronado's allergic reactions. her two daughters are also allergic, but their reactions are less severe. like the 10 million american pet owners with allergies, the coronados faced a dilemma : can human and dog co exist in the same house? " we love them, " said coronado about her family's pets. " they're adorable. they're really our babies. they're part of the family. we could never live without them. " allergies can cause itchy eyes, hives, sneezing, congestion or even asthma. to keep animals around, allergic pet owners get shots, pop antihistamines, squeeze eyedrops, squirt nasal spray, use inhalers or just deal with it. others try to find a dog that won't trigger the symptoms. president elect barack obama's family has said his family is seeking a " hypoallergenic dog, " because of his eldest daughter, malia's, allergies. unfortunately, there's no such thing. the belief that certain breeds are hypoallergenic is " a complete misconception, " said dr robert wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at johns hopkins university school of medicine. " you can't predict by type or breed, or length of hair. " pet allergies are not caused by dog hair, the american academy of allergy, asthma and immunology noted in a recent statement. " the allergen is produced in saliva, urine, dander it's not just hair, " said dr wanda phipatanakul, an allergist at children's hospital in boston, massachusetts. " even with a hairless dog, there are still allergens. " for their next pet, the coronados are considering a poodle. although poodles, bichon frises and malteses are often touted as hypoallergenic dogs, these breeds all produce allergens. there hasn't been sufficient research to determine whether certain breeds are more allergy friendly, said dr clifford bassett, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the long island college hospital in new york. " there is not a lot of research in this area, " he said. " there are differences between breeds, but we don't have research to definitively say. they all produce allergens. " the key factors are the animal's size and the volume of hair. the fur can collect pollens, mold spore and allergens and bring them indoors, triggering reactions. even so, reactions vary widely, because everyone's body is different, doctors say. before committing to a pet, make an arrangement to bring the animal to the home for a trial period to see how the person with allergies fares. " it's always going to be trial and error, " wood said. " someone might be allergic to one breed, but the main dog allergen that people are allergic to is present in all dogs. " it is also possible for someone to develop dog allergies months or years after bringing the animal home. if symptoms arise, doctors recommend getting tested to be certain that the allergy is coming from the animal. allergic reactions could come from other irritants, such as pollen or dust. a person's allergies can also inexplicably change over time. in the same way that some people outgrow food allergies, there is a rare possibility that pet owners could outgrow their allergies to animals, experts said. pills and medications are available to treat the symptoms, but the best remedy, said philatanakul, is to not have pets. " there's nothing that can be done except for avoidance, " she said. " there's no cure. you're exposing yourself to high levels of allergens in your home. we generally recommend they should not have a pet. it's not recommended. " for many families, having a loving, furry companion outweighs the runny noses, wheezing and water eyes. coronado, who is also allergic to mold, dust and yeast, suspects it's not just the dog and cat causing her headaches. after cutting out beer, bread and cheese from her diet, she says she doesn't get as many allergic reactions. but she can't pick up the cat without getting congested. sometimes harrington and kalamazoo trot into the house bringing all sorts 	 0

LEXINGTON , KY Ever since a humiliatingly short mechanical bull ride at the Cadillac Ranch last Thursday , area resident Scott Wiseck has been planning a rematch , the 27 year old UPS deliveryman reported Tuesday ." Last week was flat out embarrassing , " Wiseck said . " I was barely up on that bull five seconds before I was face down on the floor wearing my ass for a hat . It wouldn ' t have been so bad if I hadn ' t been acting like a big shot in front of those two girls from Bowling Green . I couldn ' t even look them in the eye for the rest of the night after I lost to that bull . "Lured onto the bull by the 500 prize awarded to the winner of the weekly contest , Wiseck was not ready for the Bullseye brand bull ' s U . L . code set electricals and hydraulic bucking action . According to the automatic timer , Wiseck was vanquished by the bull in just 3 . 5 seconds ." Next time will be different , though , " Wiseck said . " I ' m gonna be ready for that bull . "Wiseck said he has spent hours pondering the mistakes he made during the disastrous ride , in order to create a plan of action for Thursday ' s rematch ." I was overconfident , plain and simple , " Wiseck said . " My daddy always told me : You can ' t tame an animal unless you respect it . It ' s a little different , this bull being a machine and all , but the principle ' s the same . I went into that pit cocky , so I was bound to end up bass ackwards in front of the whole town . "Wiseck said alcohol was another factor contributing to his defeat ." I was too drunk last week , " Wiseck said . " It ' s a good idea to have a few Coors longnecks to loosen you up and give you some liquid courage , but next week , I ' m staying away from the 2 for 1 rail drinks . I ' ll have plenty of time to buy victory rounds after I take that bull down . "A large pre bull riding meal also contributed to his poor showing , Wiseck said ." An hour or so before my ride , I ate a Saddle Burger with all the fixings , " Wiseck said . " It ' s no wonder I didn ' t stay on the bull for more than a few bucks . Next Thursday , I ' ll just have one of those Power Bars . That ' ll put me in peak condition without filling me up . "Having reviewed his performance , Wiseck plans to rent the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy , to seek inspiration from John Travolta ." I haven ' t seen Urban Cowboy in a long time , so I bet it ' ll pump me up , " Wiseck said . " I ' ve also been thinking about bringing my own music to play during my ride , maybe AC DC ' s ' You Shook Me All Night Long . ' Last week , George Jones ' ' White Lightning ' was on the jukebox when I lost to the bull . As much as I love that song , it ' s just not good bull riding music . "With his plan laid out , Wiseck said he thinks he ' s in the running to not only win the 500 prize , but also beat the bar ' s all time record of 34 . 5 seconds and displace Daryl Schumacher from the chalkboard hanging behind the bar ." It ' s less about the money and more about the dignity of the Wiseck name , " Wiseck said . " I will pay the 10 entry fee over and over again , all night long , if I have to . I don ' t care what anyone says , I ' m going to beat that thing . This is personal it ' s between me and the bull . "Wiseck ' s friends say they don ' t expect him to conquer the bull this Thursday , or anytime soon ." I don ' t care how much Scotty wants it he ' s not gonna beat the Big Motherbucker , " Wiseck ' s friend Sam Lewis said . " His dreams are as big as the West Texas sky , but physically , he ' s just too weak . You need upper body strength to ride that thing , which is something you just don ' t get from driving a delivery truck all day . He should probably stick to playing foosball in the back room , where he ' s king of the table . " 	 1
LAKE ERIE Seeking to capitalize on the recent IPO rage on Wall Street , Lake Erie based blue green algae Anabaena announced Tuesday that it will go public next week with its first ever stock offering .Anabaena , a photosynthesizing , nitrogen fixing algae with 1999 revenues estimated at 0 billion , will offer 200 million shares on the NASDAQ exchange next Wednesday under the stock symbol ALG . The shares are expected to open in the 47 49 range ." This is an extremely attractive investment opportunity that no investor can afford to ignore , " said Carter Stephens , a Shearson Lehman Brothers investment consultant retained by the freshwater dwelling prokaryote to guide them through the IPO process . " In addition to being the world ' s largest producer of oxygen , Anabaena has a strong foothold in many markets other companies find untenable , from tidal spray pools of Lake Michigan to the frozen ponds of Siberia . And with its base of operation constantly expanding , the future for this blue chip algae looks especially bright . "At a press conference Monday , Richard Kollar , the McCann Erickson advertising executive in charge of marketing and public relations for Anabaena , praised the soon to be public algae ." Anabaena has been the clear leader in the blue green algae field for over 2 . 5 billion years , " Kollar said . " It ' s helped humans breathe a little easier since Day One . "Kollar then unveiled the algae ' s official advertising slogan : " Anabaena We Didn ' t Make The Atmosphere , We Just Made It Breathable ' . "Despite the fact that Anabaena has failed to turn a profitable quarter since its founding in the early Proterozoic Era , Wall Street experts said the algae ' s good name and substantial liquid holdings should more than compensate ." For every company that has a successful IPO , there are 10 others that flop , " said Brian Baum , head of online consulting for Ernst Young . " But blue green algae has a history of steady nitrogen production , as well as a very strong relationship with fungi , an environmental power player with whom it produces many common lichens . And with the number of living organisms on the planet rising every day , the demand for Anabaena ' s many products and byproducts should only grow . "Still , many investors said they are unsure whether they would be willing to take even a moderate risk on the stock ." One thing they ' re not saying in the prospectus and I ' ve been through it thoroughly is that blue green algae aren ' t really algae . They ' re cyanobacteria , " said Jeanette MacAlester , a San Francisco based stockbroker who is strongly advising her clients not to buy ALG . " I don ' t know if I ' d put my money in any bacteria , let alone one that seems to think it has something to hide . "" This is definitely a red flag stock , " Port St . Lucie , FL , day trader Paul Bostock said . " First off , blue green algae can cause swimmers ' itch . On top of that , if ingested , it can be toxic . I can see the 4 billion lawsuit already . "Despite such reservations , as well as a general concern on Wall Street over IPO oversaturation , Anabaena is expected to be a hot property when it makes its bow next week . Market forecasters are predicting an initial market valuation of 9 . 6 billion , easily eclipsing the stellar December 1998 IPO of Drosophila melanogaster , the common fruit fly . 	 1
The sight of Colin Firth in a wet white shirt left millions of women swooning and transformed the actor into a household name .Playing the brooding Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice , he dived into a lake and swam underwater before emerging with his clothes dripping and clinging to his body .But the screenwriter of the BBC ' s 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen ' s novel has now revealed that the ' wet shirt scene ' should have actually been the ' Mr Darcy full frontal nudity scene ' .Andrew Davies said the ' wet shirt ' scene with Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice was intended as the ' Mr Darcy full frontal nudity scene ' but the shirt was added laterThe writer said he wanted to reveal Mr Darcy ' s ' animal ' side by showing him diving into the lakeAndrew Davies said he did not know why the shirt was introduced but that it might be because Colin Firth was trying to hide his ' love handles ' .' I intended it as a funny little scene about social embarrassment , ' Mr Davies said .' Here are two people and one is soaking wet and neither of them refers to it .' In fact it seems to have affected women in quite a different way and who am I to complain ? 'He said he wanted to show Darcy ' s ' animal ' side by having him dive naked into a lake .' The wet shirt scene was intended to be total male frontal nudity because that was how guys went bathing in those days . But it was not for titillation it was about nature and culture , to put it in a very grand way , ' he added .' It was my notion that Darcy was an actual man but he spent all his time being constrained by the demands of society .Colin Firth has filmed nude scenes since , such as this one in Can ' t Take My Eyes Off Of YouMr Davies said the famous scene was about ' social embarrassment '' In those particular circumstances he had just spent weeks and months in London being polite with a group of very stuffy people , he was about to host a house party for the same stuffy group of people and he had a few hours in which he could be blissfully alone .' He could be blissfully himself . It was a hot day . He arrives at his lake . There is nobody to stop him . It is his property . I thought he would strip off completely and dive into that other element and become just a creature , an animal for once .' I don ' t know the reason why it ( the shirt ) came to be . Maybe it was felt it would take too long to get him dressed , although they could have just shown him diving in naked and then cut to later .' It may have been something about Colin ' s anxiety about love handles or something . 'He told the audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival that he had deliberately written physical elements into the screenplay of the Austen classic .' I had a kind of project to try to emphasise that these people have bodies as well as brains and little bits of wit and irony and so on , ' he said .' I devised as many scenes as possible in which people were getting dressed , getting undressed , having a bath , girls combing their hair what we call hair and shoulder scenes . 'It has previously been revealed that Colin Firth never actually dived during filming .A stuntman performed the dive amid health and safety fears that the actor might catch a water borne disease from the lake .And footage of him swimming underwater was actually filmed in a tank at Ealing Studios in West London , hundreds of miles from Lyme Park in Cheshire which was the location for Pemberley in the 1995 BBC adaptation . 	 0
Archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of Roman graves in southwest France , some of which contain skeletons still bound by shackles on their necks and ankles .The incredible excavation is located at a building site about 250m west of the Saintes amphitheatre once used for battles between gladiators and wild animals .Among the hundreds of graves found , five skeletons four adults and one child were found shackled or chained .A skeleton uncovered at the Roman burial site pictured exactly as the individual was buried with an iron shackle attached to his neckA wider photo shows the same skeleton thought to be a man with a shackle on his ankle as well as his neckThis group of four people were buried head to toe in a small , trench style graveDating back to the first and second centuries AD , the grave site is thought to have been an important necropolis used for those massacred at the nearby stadium .Three skeletons were found with iron chains attached to their legs , another was buried in a crude shackle around his neck and a child was found with a device on its wrist .Several of the graves were found to be mass burials pictures show individuals buried side by side , head to toe in trench style graves .The site was first identified as a possible necropolis last year and scientists are now hoping they can establish the individuals ' cause of death .Roman necropoleis were usually constructed in the country as a site for burials and cremations to take place away from tombs built within a city .In this photo , another skeleton can be seen buried with a shackle still attached to its ankleUnfortunately , the graves at Saintes have yielded almost no artefacts or possessions .Only a few vases were found with the remains of one man , and a child was found with coins resting on his eyes .Roman custom was to place coins on the eyes of the deceased so the person ' s spirit could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Romans believed divided the world of the living and that of the dead .The period of Roman rule across what is now France is commonly referred to as Gallo Roman , and the graves discovered in Saintes this week fall within this category .The period in which the graves were used the first and second centuries AD corresponds to a time in history when Saintes ' was a thriving Roman town .It was established as a regional capital during this period because of its location where the major road between Lyon and Acquitaine met with the Charente River .It is famed for its Roman Colosseum style arena , which when completed , held up to 18 , 000 people .Construction on the area started during the reign of Tiberius ( 14 37AD ) and finished under Claudius ( 41 54AD ) . It is the largest and oldest remaining Roman amphitheatre in France . 	 0
at the 1964 new york world's fair, people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight. if only the future looked like " star trek, " with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem. they wanted to see the " futurama, " a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century american city that featured moving sidewalks, computer guided cars zipping along congestion free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea. forty years later, we're still waiting for those congestion free highways along with the jet pack, the paperless office and all those " star trek " like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st century life so easy. daniel wilson has been waiting as well. he's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books, old science magazines and cheesy sci fi movies from the 1950s, and came up with one question. why isn't the future what it used to be? " i feel entitled to have all this technology that's been promised at a certain time, " says wilson, author of " where's my jetpack? " " i look up and say,'where's all this stuff?'''some of that futuristic stuff, it turns out, is already here. visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars, but they could never work out the real world applications, wilson says. other inventions had the same problem. ordinary people didn't want to have anything to do with them. these futuristic follies include everything from " smell o vision, " an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies sanyo's " ultrasonic ultra squeaky clean human washing machine " ( it was dubbed the " human washing machine, " but wouldn't fit in an ordinary bathroom ) and, of course, the jet pack. " scientists are ok at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future, " wilson says. " they're really bad at predicting how it's going to affect us. " what happened to my jet pack? the jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future, wilson says. he says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an amazing stories comic book, which featured the hero buck rogers zooming though the sky in a jet pack. the jet pack was actually developed by 1961, wilson says. an inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt. a variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 james bond movie, " thunderball. " today, the jet pack continues to grab inventors'imaginations. a daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1, 500 foot wide canyon in colorado in november. a swiss pilot, dubbed " fusion man, " flew across the english channel last year using a single jet propelled wing. and a new zealand inventor recently invented a jet pack, which weighs about 250 pounds, that reportedly can run for 30 minutes. the jet pack, though, has never really taken off, wilson says. the problem is its practical application. while a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds, its fuel lasted for only about half a minute, " which led to more screaming, " wilson says. the military couldn't find a useful application for it either. a soldier with a jet pack might look cool, but he's an easy target. nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush hour traffic, wilson says. jet packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby, with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes. yet other bold visions of the future have come true. remember rosey the robot? that was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the jetsons, the popular cartoon family from the future. rosey has become " wakamaru. " that's the name of a 3 foot tall robot with a goofy grin that the mitsubishi conglomerate in japan invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars. wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10, 000 words, wilson says. " beam me up scotty, " is a tagline from another television show, " star trek ". but teleportation has been invented, wilson says. he says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon a bundle of electromagnetic energy from one side of a room to another in 1993. physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today, wilson says. " teleporting anything, even elementary particles, is mind blowing, " wilson says. " why is it that most people don't know it exists? it hasn't been put into practice yet. in real life, it's always about,'what can you do for me?'" a darker view of technology's futurepeople 	 0
Gilad Shalit is free . The first of 1 , 027 Palestinians have returned home , and in Egypt observers are cautiously applauding the oft criticized leadership that secured the deal it ' s a more hopeful note in a democratic transition that has otherwise been checkered .For Israel and America , the culmination of drawn out and somewhat oblique negotiations possibly signifies a more positive future in relations with a new leadership that had until now been viewed as a potentially destabilizing force for peace in the Middle East .In the days since murmurs of a fruitful end to the negotiations began to circulate , Egypt has reiterated its commitment to honoring its accords with Israel . In reflecting on the months since Hosni Mubarak stepped down on February 11 , it is clear that the interim government and de facto president , Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , have in effect done their utmost to maintain a Mubarak era status quo .The question , is how long will this last ? And will Egypt continue to be the ally of America in a region caught in a dependency that often undermines its longer term interests and the will of its people ?Under the Mubarak regime , relations with Israel were strong , albeit concealed . The 1978 Camp David treaty was a deal between leaders ( former president Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin ) that many Egyptians opposed . Economic ties between the two states steadily increased under the tutelage of Mubarak ' s business associates , who stood to profit from them and military cooperation , for example on Gaza , was deep . Yet many Egyptians continued to harbor deep rooted animosity towards the neighboring state .The former regime , well aware of this , gave people enough space to air their grievances Egypt ' s protest movement emerged in part from the tradition of demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians , which the government allowed . At the same time , the Mubarak regime worked to keep its relations with Israel as low profile as possible .Mubarak is now gone , most of his business associates have been put behind bars , and the defacto rulers of the liberated Egypt are left to grapple with the question of Israel . For the ruling military council , adhering to the Camp David Accords comes at a cost , but until it finds a better alternative to the aid it receives from the United States for sticking to its end of the deal a package that includes military training , resources , financial aid , intelligence support , as well as regional security guarantees it is worth the price .With no viable alternative , the problem , or question perhaps , arises in what pressure a new parliament , and the new found public voice , might assert to change that status quo . Outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo last month , protesters , many of them young activists , set the Israeli flag on fire , scaled the embassy walls , and demanded an end to relations with " the Zionist state . " But unlike the people of Gaza , few Egyptians appear to be celebrating the release of hundreds of prisoners held in Israel . Rather , on Twitter and on the ground , they are describing it as yet another ploy by the ruling military council to consolidate its power . " They just want to show that they can negotiate and oversee foreign policy , " someone tweeted . " This is a dirty game to secure power , " another said .Although it is indisputable that the majority of Egyptians even the Muslim Brotherhood do not want to go to war , their grievances towards Israel , and then America , run deep as deep , perhaps , as their grievances towards the former regime . The likelihood of the military council or a future Cabinet of ministers and its president being able to maintain the status quo that long reassured America and its friends , is highly unlikely . Rather , in the new Egypt , which is struggling to get on solid footing , there will be fleeting moments of hope , but also , many more moments of protest when the people stand up and use the leverage they have uncovered in organized street movements to challenge the regime .Many of the gripes will be internal including minimum wage , inflation , and economic opportunities but enough will involve Egypt ' s relations with the world . In Egypt today , we are witnessing a population that has found its voice , and the confidence and right to assert it . We are also witnessing a public that understands what organized protest can achieve . There is no taking or turning that back .For global powers and neighbors that have long relied on Egypt as a constant and stable partner and force , that era is gone . In the new Egypt , and the new Middle East , the will of the people is the force to reckon with , and just as they fought for the ousting of Mubarak , they will also fight for a government of their own choosing .In that government , there will be at least as many adversaries to the regional status quo as there are supporters and in that too , there will be no turning back . 	 0
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court dealt federal prosecutors dual setbacks Monday in efforts to prosecute the laundering of drug ring and organized crime profits .The Supreme Court considered a pair of cases involving hidden money and an illegal gambling ring .The justices ruled that merely hiding money headed out of the United States is not proof of money laundering .Justices also concluded that prosecutors had to prove that an illegal gambling ring had laundered profits of its betting , rather than just proceeds .In a unanimous ruling , the justices overturned the federal conviction of Humberto Regaldo Cuellar , who had run afoul of the " transportation " part of the international money laundering law when his car was stopped by a deputy sheriff near Eldorado , Texas .Inside the car , officers found nearly 81 , 000 in cash wrapped in duct taped bundles and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair , presumably to trick drug sniffing dogs . Police suspected the money came from drug trafficking and arrested Cuellar , who had been heading for Mexico when he was stopped . Cuellar was convicted and sentenced to 78 months in prison .Federal law requires proof the transportation was " designed to conceal or disguise the nature , location , the source , the ownership , or the control " of the money . Writing for the high court , Justice Clarence Thomas said prosecutors failed to prove the reason for moving the money across the border was to hide its source , as part of an alleged international drug ring ." Although the evidence suggested Cuellar ' s transportation would have the effect of concealing funds , the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation " Thomas wrote .Congress passed a law in 1986 designed to prevent the laundering , or " washing , " of criminal funds through legitimate enterprises and overseas bank accounts .In the other case , the high court split 5 4 in concluding that prosecutors failed to show money used to pay couriers in alleged gambling operation were " profits , " rather than " gross proceeds . "The case involved Efrain Santos and Benedicto Diaz , convicted of running an illegal lottery in Indiana since the 1970s . Santos allegedly used a network of " runners " and " collectors " to run the enterprise , and Diaz was a collector who gathered money from the runners and delivered it to Santos ." The money laundering charges brought against Santos were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees , and the money laundering charge brought against Diaz was based on his receipt of payments as an employer , " Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a very narrow opinion ." Neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery ' s profits , " Scalia added . " Indeed , the government did not try to prove , and the defendants have not admitted , that they laundered criminal profits . "Scalia noted the high court ' s ruling would not overly burden prosecutors , saying only one instance of " profitability " would be required to prove money laundering . " What counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it , " he said , adding the government " exaggerates " the difficulty it would have to do that .Although Scalia wrote the main ruling , it was Justice John Paul Stevens who provided the critical fifth vote for a majority , and his concurring views will probably provide the controlling opinion to guide lower courts in similar cases down the road .Stevens did not go as far as Scalia wanted , saying Congress failed by writing an " ambiguous " law that only confused judges . He said lawmakers seemed to want a broader interpretation of " proceeds " as the term applied to money laundering .Justices Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy , Stephen Breyer , and Chief Justice John Roberts dissented . 	 0
Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gaining weight , a new study has revealed .Scientists found a specific bacterial family passed down form generation to generation was more common in the guts of lean individuals .Lab tests showed a strain of that bacteria prevented people gaining weight when it was transplanted in mice .Genetics influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our body , the study found .Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gain weight , a new study has revealedThe breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity related diseases on an individual ' s genetic make up .Associate Professor Ruth Ley at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics of Cornell University said : ' Up until now , variation in the abundances of gut microbes has been explained by diet , the environment , lifestyle , and health .' This is the first study to firmly establish that certain types of gut microbes are heritable that their variation across a population is in part due to host genotype variation , not just environmental influences . 'Both genetic variation and the composition of gut microbes have previously been linked to diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity , putting sufferers at greater risk of heart disease , stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels .Despite these common links . the relationship between genetic variation and the diversity of gut microbes has been difficult to establish .Past studies of twins failed to reveal an effect of genetic variation on the diversity of gut microbes .The Cornell University researchers suspected past studies included too few pairs of twins .As a result they sequenced the genes of microbes found in stool samples from 416 pairs of twins .They found an abundance of specific types of microbes were more similar in identical twins , who are genetically the same , than in non identical pairs no more similar than ordinary siblings , other than sharing environmental influences in the womb .The findings demonstrated that human genes influence the composition of gut microbes .The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity related diseases on an individual ' s genetic make up , the team at Cornell University believe . File pictureThe type of bacteria whose abundance was most heavily influenced by human genetics was a recently identified family called christensenellaceae .Members of the health promoting bacterial family were more abundant in lean individuals , than those who were obese .Mice that were then treated with this specific bacteria strain gained less weight than those that were not treated with the microbes .The team believe their findings could pave the way for a microbe that prevents obesity in humans .Prof Ley said : ' Our results showing that bacterial abundances run in families may be useful for disease risk prediction .' The microbiome is also an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation . By understanding the nature of our association with these health associated bacteria , we could eventually exploit them to promote health . 'The study was published in the journal Cell . 	 0
NEW YORK CITY One of the stars of the reality show The Jersey Shore , JWoww has come out swinging against one third of the infamous Kardashian sisters , Kim .According to Tittle Tattle Tonight JWoww is extremely upset that KimKar is denying that she has had any plastic surgery or botox done on her body .The Jersey Shore starlet said that anyone can tell just by looking at the ex girlfriend of Dallas Cowboy receiver Miles Austin that she has had her boobs lifted , her belly tucked , her Adam ' s apple minimized , and her lips botoxed .Kim Kardashian responded by saying that it is none of JWoww the Cow ' s business what she has had done to her body , her head , or her toenails .Kardashian went on to say that instead of being concerned about what everyone else is doing that the top heavy guidette needs to concern herself with trying to get rid of her obnoxious Sardinian accent , her gigantic elephant ears , and her school girl looking pigtails .JWoww replied that Kim ' s ass is so big that she heard that Miles used to use it as a table on which he would place his beer bottle .Kardashian addressed that by saying that he did that one time and one time only and that the beer bottle slipped off after about ten minutes .Kim reportedly told Tittle Tattle Tonight that it is her understanding that two guys who went to high school with JWoww have remarked that they could not believe the strong pizza smell that emanated from her tata ' s .JWoww responded to that rumor by saying that the two guys who said that are just jealous because she would not go out with them . She said that one guy , Carmine Stazzoli , had a little bitty groin gizmo ( wienie ) and the other guy , Bettino Cagliani , actually wore Wonder Woman boxer shorts .Kim Kardashian informed Tittle Tattle Tonight that she is going to be making a movie with fellow Jersey Shore cast mate Nicole " Snooki " Polizzi entitled , ' The Two Guidettes From Jersey Take On The Vile , Vicious , Vulgar , Vampires of Vancouver .

Since the tragic disappearance of three year old Maddie McCann on 3rd May 2007 , Clarence Mitchell , the McCann ' s Spokesman , and several well known Newspapers , have named every conceivably mode of transport , that Maddy may have been abducted in , to receive publicity .BirdsOcean Club Nanny , Kirsty Maryan who has been described as a key witness by Private Investigators Metodo 3 , and as a wild Bird by local residents , often got pissed and stripped on her nights off flashing her boobs and bottom . Mr Mitchell did say " that he thought that even though the young ladies behaviour was inappropriate , she was an extremely reliable witness . "The other Bird , Nanny Charlotte Pennington claims she saw a man called Mr F Chichester in a small dinghy , kinking an object , which looked like the body of a small child , stored in the boats hull . Believe it or not , but Miss Pennington has worked in a Fairy Shop since the age of fourteen .BoatsJust a few hours after Maddie disappeared an ex pat , Mr N Parker claimed he saw a man carrying a young child across the Marina in Praia Da Luz to a Yacht . The child was then passed to a Mr C Blythe on the yacht , which shortly afterwards sailed out of the harbour , which was for the first time in two years .PlanesShortly after Maddie disappeared Mr N Parker also reported seeing a man carrying a young child to a light aircraft at the nearby airfield at Portimao . The child was then passed to a Mr H Biggles , who shortly afterwards took off in the plane , which was the first time for several months .On FootJane Tanner one of the infamous Tappas Nine claims she saw a Mediterranean type male carrying a small child away from the McCann ' s apartment at around 9 . 15pm on the fateful evening . Her artist ' s impression description which was so vague it was useless , suddenly magically transformed in to a completely different person . This was the first time a Mediterranean type male had been seen in the area , for several months .By TaxiSixty seven year old Taxi Drive Senor J Clarkson , claims he transported three men , a woman and a young girl in pink pyjamas with a distinctive eye mark , to a Hotel in Villa Real De Sanyo Antonio near Faro . He claims that one of the men resembled suspect Robert Murat , and the woman Kate McCann , Maddie ' s mother . This was the first time in Portugal , a young girl had been seen with her Mother in a Taxi for more than three years .By Jet SkiJust nine hours after Maddie was reported missing , Mr N Parker saw a bundle of clothing the same size as a small child , being carried off the local beach to a Jet Ski . The bundle was then handed to a Mr G Rusedski on the Jet Ski , which then disappeared out to sea , which was the first time for several weeks .ConclusionRegardless of the spin spun by Gerry , Kate and Clarence , it is a fact that the Portuguese Police believe that two out of three of the suspects are indeed , Gerry and Kate McCann .Gerry and Kate McCann and Mr Mitchell , are the only three people in the World who actually believe that a miracle will occur and Maddie will turn up one day .They are so convinced of the fact that they are prepared to spend over 1 Million to find her .Apparently over half of the money will have been paid to Barcelona based Private Detective Agency Metodo 3 , who claim a 100 record in finding children . That is up to now , as the only thing that they have achieved so far , is to move in to plush new Offices .Never in the history of a missing person have so many rich and famous celebrities become involved , either by donating money or promoting publicity .Never in history have so many unknown people tried to become famous , for claiming to have spotted a missing person .So there we have it , Birds and Boats and Planes , a Jet Ski , a Mediterranean looking bloke in Portugal , numerous people trying to get in to a Newspaper and a Bird who worked in a Fairy Shop .Tell me it is not true its just a Fairy Story ! 	 1
behind the super confident exterior, john guidetti is a romantic at heart. the things he truly values in life are beyond the reach of money. it is why the swedish scoring sensation insists he can imagine forsaking greater riches elsewhere to stay at celtic once his season long loan is finished. all he wants for now is to concentrate on extending the superb form recognised with receipt of the spfl player of the month award for october. john guidetti has been in fine form for celtic since joining the scottish side on a season long loan dealthe swedish international was named the spfl player of the month for octoberwhen decision time comes, however, guidetti is adamant that the numbers on his contract will be secondary to the number of goals he could score in the right environment. an adoring audience is already being created at parkhead, where fans have long been desperate to savour a forward with real star quality. guidetti, as prolific in press conferences as he is on the pitch, has delivered sackfuls of the stuff since moving north from manchester city. the 22 year old's contract at the etihad expires at the end of the season. after nine goals in his first nine celtic appearances, every further strike will heighten demands from supporters to keep him in glasgow on a more permanent basis. it will be no easy task. guidetti is thought to earn in the region of 40, 000 per week at city. that is significantly more than celtic's best paid player, but well within the reach of a middling english premier league side impressed by his return to fitness and form. compromises will inevitably have to be made if parkhead is to become his longer term home, but guidetti has declared himself open to all possibilities. guidetti's current deal at manchester city is due to expire at the end of the season'of course i can see myself here next year,'he insisted.'you can always see yourself at a club like this. it's an amazing football club.'i want to thank the fans for being so kind to me. they put a bit of pressure on me last week by singing my name even before i scored!'i thought, " s t, now i have to score! " thankfully i did, but i have to be thankful to my team mates and to the whole club. everyone has been amazing.'if it's the right thing then it is the right thing. i don't think money has anything to do with it. as long as you can put food on the table and support your family.'of course this is my job and you want to be financially stable, but you are going to be at a club like this.'you have to look at all the options and see what is there. i need to put myself in a good position by playing well. celtic want me to play well also and just focus on this year. it's my agent's job at the end of the season.'two years ago, a virus attacked guidetti's nervous system and almost cost him the ability to play football. inevitably, the huge stress of that experience which left him hosptialised and cost him a place at euro 2012 has shaped his outlook. three seasons after an exceptional loan spell at feyenoord, the return of regular action with celtic has been a genuine delight.'for me, my dream is to play in the biggest games possible and do well, play for my country, win trophies and have a heck of a good time,'he added.'when you look back you are not going to think that was a nice day when i signed that bonus cheque. it's about saying, " that goal was a beauty ".'when you are talking to your three year old grandkids, you want to show them a nice goal on youtube.'i would give any amount of money to score a goal and celebrate. it's the best feeling in the world.'the most important thing for me is just to keep getting games under my belt and to smash it to do the best that i can, never stop and try to improve by working my ass off.'i want to embrace this year because i think it is going to be amazing. we have high hopes and i think we can achieve them.'to be told you might never play football again to this point where i'm player of the month with celtic that's a big contrast.'i never thought what i would do if i had to stop playing football. i would be finished as a person. i would not exist. me without football is nothing.'guidetti is keen on helping celtic challenge for trophies before making a decision on his futurethe 22 year old has revealed he dreams of playing in front of a packed celtic parkguidetti has already boldly declared his intention to help celtic towards a clean sweep of 	 0
SARAJEVO , BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA The recent discovery of corruption within the Bosnian government is being overshadowed by the even more shocking discovery that a Bosnian government actually exists in the first place , U . N . sources reported Monday ." The misappropriation of 2 . 1 billion in United Nations relief funds by Bosnia ' s leaders has stunned me and my fellow countrymen , " Sarajevo resident Emir Odobasic said . " We were completely unaware we had any leaders . "Bosnian citizens are accustomed to corruption , regarding bribery , extortion , graft and money laundering as facts of life in their chaotic , war torn nation . However , few had any idea the corruption was governmental in nature ." We have a government ? " said Jasmin Vrsac , a Prijedor farmer who has worked his family ' s landmine strewn fields for most of his 72 years . " I am surprised to hear this . "Bosnian government officials themselves were taken aback by the news of the government ' s existence ." I knew I worked in some sort of large , bureaucratic office building in Sarajevo , " Stolac Brcko said . " And I receive a weekly check for processing a big pile of forms . But neither I nor any of my associates had any knowledge that I was the Minister of Transport . "Newly discovered Bosnian prime minister Alija Izetbegovic , who said he is " as stunned as anyone " by the news of the corruption and the government ' s existence , has denied any wrongdoing ." I have done nothing illegal , " Izetbegovic said . " In fact , I have done nothing in particular whatsoever . "" This corruption scandal looks bad now , certainly , " Izetbegovic told members of the Bosnian parliament , none of whom he recognized . " But I , as well as whoever the rest of Bosnia ' s leaders turn out to be , will be cleared of these charges very soon . With the help of U . N . investigators , we will reveal to the world just what happened here , as well as what exactly all of you strange people are doing in what I thought was my summer house . " 	 1
Washington A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia has indicted two people for their alleged attempts to supply Iran with U . S . materials for gas centrifuges to enrich uranium , the Justice Department said Friday .The indictment charges Parviz Khaki , an Iranian citizen , and Zongcheng Yi , a resident of China , each with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( IEEPA ) by conspiring to export the goods without the required license .Both also face one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States , two counts of smuggling , two counts of illegally exporting U . S . goods to Iran in violation of IEEPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering , the Justice Department said .The indictment also accuses Khaki of seeking to obtain for customers in Iran radioactive source materials from the United States .Khaki , 43 , was arrested in the Philippines in May . Yi remains at large ." This new indictment shows that we have no tolerance for those who try to traffic in commodities that can be used to support Iran ' s nuclear program , " U . S . Attorney Ronald C . Machen Jr . said in a statement . " It also underscores our commitment to aggressively enforcing export laws . "As a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , Iran has the right , like other countries , to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors . But the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb . That ' s what many Western countries suspect Iran is doing .Iran insists its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes .Among the materials Khaki and Yi are accused of trying to obtain are measuring instruments , pressure transducers , vacuum pumps and maraging steel , a class of high strength steel . All can be used in gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment .The indictment alleges they both also caused the illegal export of lathes and nickel alloy wire to Iran , and it accuses Khaki of trying to obtain radioactive source materials . In 2009 and again in 2011 , he allegedly contacted an undercover U . S . federal agent , posing as an exporter , asking the agent to purchase radioactive sources .A law enforcement official , not authorized to talk to the media , declined to say whether the radioactive and centrifuge materials made it through to Iran . The lathes and nickel alloy wire were shipped from the United States through China to Iran .If convicted , Khaki and Yi could face up to 20 years in prison for conspiring to violate IEEPA , five years for conspiring to defraud the United States , 10 years for each smuggling count , 20 years for each exporting count and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering . 	 0
as wisconsin prepares to try two children as adults in an attempted murder case allegedly inspired by the mythical slenderman, the prosecution of two preteens in adult court challenges our faith in the juvenile justice system. the entire juvenile justice system is premised upon one bedrock principle. it's an immutable fact that our parents and forebears have known for millennia, and it's something that science is increasingly backing up : juveniles are different. they are irresponsible. they say the darndest things. i believe children are our future teach them well and let them see the way. show them all the beauty well, everything whitney houston said in that song, you get the point. the point is, this is why we have a juvenile justice system in the first place. not only are children developmentally different, but even the supreme court has long recognized that they are also constitutionally different. as recognized by justice anthony kennedy in a recent court opinion, a child's immaturity leads to recklessness, impulsiveness, and risky behavior. children are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures both from lousy family members and from ne'er do well peers. they have limited control over their environment and lack the capacity to extricate themselves from bad situations. the flipside to all this is that because a child's character is not as fixed as an adult's, bad behavior is not necessarily indicative of irretrievable depravity. children are redeemable because they may simply " grow out " of their bad behavior. the bottom line, according to the court, is that these differences diminish the traditional penological justifications for harsh punishment of juveniles even when they commit the most horrific crimes. the juvenile justice system is different because kids are different. modern science agrees, providing biological explanations for juvenile delinquency : " the most noteworthy features of adolescent brain development relate to changes occurring within the brain's frontal lobes in particular the prefrontal cortex and in the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain structures. these areas and interconnections are critical to'executive'functions such as planning, motivation, judgment, and decisionmaking, including the evaluation of future consequences, the weighing of risk and reward, the perception and control of emotions, and the processing and inhibition of impulses, " the american psychological association, the american psychiatric association and the national association of social workers wrote in a friend of the court brief filed with the supreme court in 2012. this research plus our firmly entrenched notions about juvenile responsibility have informed the operation of our juvenile justice system since its inception. instead of punishment and incarceration, the juvenile system focuses on treatment and rehabilitation. at least that's the theory. but how is it executed? typically, a juvenile court can send a child to a secure educational facility instead of prison, and juvenile courts generally lose jurisdiction over children at a statutory age usually anywhere from 21 to 25. their juvenile records are customarily sealed and not public like adult criminal records. the idea is this : once you are an adult, you get a fresh start. after all, your childish behavior is now behind you. unless well, unless what you did was really, really, really bad. in that case? you're going to prison at shawshank with the rest of the adults. although all states differ, the general rule is this : juvenile court has jurisdiction over a child unless he or she is alleged to have committed something awful, like murder or attempted murder, and then the case is automatically ( or at the discretion of the court or prosecutor ) placed in adult court, where the child is subject to adult penalties. but what happened to all that " prefrontal cortex " talk and the supreme court, and " children are fundamentally different "? apparently, children are different but if they really make us angry, they can go be different in prison. it's a paradox. we treat children according to their developmental culpability, with a colossal exception : if the consequences of their behavior are really serious, we instead deal with them according to the outcome even though the biological genesis of that behavior remains exactly the same. if a child punches an adult, the child may land in juvenile court. if a child punches an adult, and that adult falls and dies, then the child might be in adult court. same root causes of bad behavior, different judicial outcome. the neurology remains the same in all cases, but we inconsistently demand disparate treatment. why the judicial hypocrisy? it's as if society is saying it acknowledges all the science about adolescent brain development and is fine with it as long as we're talking about crimes like spray painting cars, smoking pot, or a fistfight at school. but for those most egregious crimes like murder, the scientific mumbo jumbo goes out the window. when 	 0
CHICAGO Remember Richard Jefferson , the ? 14 year NBA veteran . He ' s my pick for this season ' s Cleveland Cavaliers X Factor of the team .Jefferson , 36 , was arguably the Cavaliers ' most consistent player during the preseason and he has a golden opportunity to be the best backup LeBron James has ever had .The reigning Eastern Conference champions experimented with Shawn Marion last season and it failed miserably , to say the least . Marion , a ? possible future Hall of Famer , was retired before he even retired . Over the summer the team went the same route in plucking another aging vet to spell James .Most believed Jefferson was an upgrade over Marion , though that wasn ' t saying much . But so far we ' ve seen Jefferson dunk over a 7 footer , we ' ve seen him play smart defense and we ' ve seen him still be ? a threat with the 3 point ball .In six exhibition games , Jefferson averaged 23 . 0 minutes and produced 11 . 2 points and 4 . 5 boards while shooting 40 percent from 3 point range and 50 percent from the field .Those are substantial numbers coming out of a second unit that will eventually feature Mo Williams and Iman Shumpert .If the Cavaliers are to make a deep postseason run as many expect , the handling of James throughout ? the season is crucial . ? He ' ll turn 31 on Dec . 30 , and we ' re slowly starting to see his body break down . It was evident last year and during the preseason .From here on out , James will have to rest more frequently to preserve the prime years he has left . Part of his hesitancy to take time off last season ? came ? from who was subbing in for him .Harken back to the days of Ira Newble , Luke Jackson , Jamario Moon , Sasha Pavlovic . Yes , it was bad .Jefferson is hungry . He has never won an NBA title . He went to The Finals back to back years with the Nets early on in his career , but lost both times . He understands how difficult it is to reach the promise land . That ' s why his arrival at this time is so ? valuable .If what we ' ve seen from Jefferson in the preseason is an indication of what type of regular season he ' ll have , James can ? average the fewest minutes of his career . And that bodes well for James ' shelf life as an elite player and for the Cavaliers ' championship hopes . 	 0
Diana Degarmo finally broke down and cried today . " I ' m so f in ' sick and tired of being the nice and sweet girl . I ain ' t got no street cred since doing this whack American Idol . People don ' t even think I ' m latina enough . It sucks . F k Fantasia . I should ' ve won . "It seems that all the stress of the past few weeks and the fact that the judges ruined her chances of winning the other night when they all but announced that " America would be stupid to make you our American Idol . Fantasia is better and she won ' t get us charged with racism . Go home , little girl . Go home and go to your prom . "" Yeah , Diana was really hurt about they way they shoved her aside at the finale , but she ' s a trooper . She ' ll get through this . I know I can help her understand how to succeed in this business without the endorsement of people like Simon Cowell , " Justin Guarini , the first season runner up who has been treated like chopped liver ever since that whole From Justin to Kelly crap ." I mean really . It ' s like they blamed me for the whole movie mess . It wasn ' t my fault . Did Kelly ' s career suffer as a result ? NO . But , I ' m not bitter . I have my fans and I ' m going to make it on my own . " Justin said .So , will the two runner ups consider working together ? Justin says , " Yeah , in a heartbeat . We could both use the exposure . American Idol is not exposed enough to this country and well , you just have to hop on every opportunity that comes our way , even if they are so few and far between . "Attempts to interview Diana returned a nasty , " Step off bitch and , I know you ain ' t gonna come here and be startin ' somethin ' . I love every f in ' person affiliated with American Idol . Yes I do . And that song Tamyra Gray wrote for the winner was not custom made for Fantasia . It wasn ' t . I ' m just happy to be a finalist , really I am . "John Stevens was seen leaving Diana ' s room . He said , " There ' s nothing going on between us . I was just bringing her some Haagen Dazs . We were talking about backwards racism and how cruel this whole business can be . I cheered her up by reading her some of my hate mail and playing back voice mail death threats . It was a hoot . "Elton John had this to say , " As a white person , I am glad that people who are white or suspected to be white know that they have no right to be in this industry anymore , unless they are gay . I did Diana and John Stevens a favor . I am pleased that I could help American Idol end this way . " 	 1
HAPEVILLE , GA Calling his recent layoff " just the kind of a kick in the pants " he needed , former Ford Motor Company autoworker Chris Thaney announced the creation of the Thaney Motor Company Monday ." Losing my job was the best thing that could have ever happened to me , " said the 34 year old Thaney , who made 57 , 000 on the production line as a door fitter until the Hapeville plant closed down last month . " I know cars . I ' ve been around cars for nearly a decade now . I don ' t need to work for a big , corporate auto manufacturer to do what I love . "" It ' s going to be great , " Thaney continued . " Finally I get to be my own boss , set my own hours , and make my own cars . "Headquartered in Thaney ' s home garage and financed mainly through his unemployment compensation and United Auto Workers layoff benefits , the new company ' s credo is , according to Thaney , to " design affordable , versatile and easy handling cars for ordinary Americans . " Saying that his time at Ford taught him " what not to do , " Thaney explained that his car company will not be the victim of overproduction and other inefficient practices that have resulted in intensifying competition and declining profits ." Today ' s consumers want something made with precision and care , " Thaney said . " Not something that was spit out in 58 seconds by a thousand people and some machines . "Thaney said his cars will be a hit with the public because he will " spare no expense , " while still managing to avoid stifling bureaucracy , overpaid executives , and cost overruns ." As long as I ' m in charge , that ' s the Thaney Motor Company pledge , " he added ." At Ford it was all about the bottom line , " said Thaney , who is currently on the lookout for a good source of Italian leather for the upholstery . " With me , the customer will always come first . Well , after the cars . "Thaney said Thaney Motor Company will " go out of its way " to show that its commitment to new ideas and innovation extends all the way to the top of the organization ." Where Ford went wrong was not going on the Internet to find engines and other parts , " Thaney said . " They could have joined one of those online car clubs and swapped stuff for practically nothing , without compromising on quality . "Already , Thaney is hard at work building his first model , the Thaney Centaur , a four door station wagon based on his wife ' s 1999 Ford Taurus four door station wagon , whose platform he considers " an American classic in need of some minor retooling . " He also has plans to create models patterned closely after the Ford Focus engine , the Dodge Neon chassis , and a friend ' s 1990 Pontiac Grand Prix paint job . In a nod to his old assembly line position , the models will boast well fitted doors and multiple side mounted mirrors .Though he didn ' t want to get his hopes up , Thaney admitted the initial planning phases have left him " very optimistic " and said that he already has several friends and relatives lined up who said they would " definitely " drive a car manufactured by him ." I ' m still trying to figure out how to install airbags , CD changers , GPS systems , steering wheels , and trunks , " Thaney said . " But once I learn these things , I ' ll craft them with precision and care , not like some of the stuff you see coming out of Detroit . "Thaney plans to roll out the first Thaney Centaur by February , but hopes to step up production considerably by the end of 2007 with the creation of three additional vehicles . He projects that his company will be manufacturing at full capacity by the end of the decade and pulling a healthy profit , which he promises to reinvest in the company to enable further new designs and advancements ." I know I ' m taking a risk , " Thaney said . " But if you don ' t streamline and innovate , you won ' t get anywhere . You need moxie to succeed in this business , and if I can make a better car than the other guy , it will sell itself . " 	 1
SAGEBROOK , NJ Following the reported suicide of local teen Jenny Gordon , longtime bully Hannah Boucard , 17 , told reporters Wednesday that she could not believe her classmate took four straight years of being told to kill herself seriously .Boucard , who reflected on the verbal and written assaults she had directed toward Gordon on a daily basis since first meeting her in 2011 , confirmed that she was still shocked that her classmate could let over 2 , 000 suggestions to end her life get to her ." How was I supposed to know that sending a text every single morning saying the world would be better off if she died would be the type of thing she ' d take personally ? said Boucard , adding that the recently deceased Gordon must have been a lot more sensitive than she thought . " I probably only told her once each day during gym class that nobody can stand to be around her or look at her pimply face , and that we ' re all waiting for her to climb into the tub and slit her wrists . Sure , from seventh through 10th grade I posted Facebook message after Facebook message to her timeline telling her that everyone who knows her wished she would just disappear and just because of that she killed herself ? Give me a break . "" God , I didn ' t think she ' d get that bent out of shape when I Gchatted her every day to tell her she would be much happier dead than alive , " Boucard added ." You ' d think she would have understood that , when I repeatedly called her a worthless slut who wouldn ' t be missed , I wasn ' t being literal . "Boucard told reporters that , even in retrospect , she was still unsure how Gordon could have actually believed her almost daily suggestions that going home after school and taking her life would be the best thing for everyone , including her parents . Noting that she never actually meant any of the scores of weekly tweets , instant messages , and Snapchats encouraging Gordon to put herself out of her misery , Boucard stated she remains bewildered as to how her 16 year old classmate could have seen it that way .Sources confirmed that Boucard always assumed that Gordon would have known she was only messing around when it came to turning her friends against the high school sophomore and constantly tormenting her in the cafeteria , at the mall , before softball practice , on bus rides , and throughout summer vacations ." You ' d think she would have understood that , when I repeatedly called her a worthless slut who wouldn ' t be missed , I wasn ' t being literal , " said Boucard , stating that she couldn ' t help it if Gordon somehow overanalyzed or misinterpreted the intent behind the barrage of anonymous messages deriding her weight issues that she sent on apps like Yik Yak and Burnbook . " How was she going to get through life if every single time someone spent their entire middle school career hounding her to finally end it all , she did it ?" She ' s such a drama queen , " Boucard continued .After describing the malicious note that she left in Gordon ' s locker hours before her death , Boucard told reporters that four years of unending abuse is apparently all it takes to get under some people ' s skin ." It was just a simple , silly 1 , 100 texts over the course of her entire adolescence saying she had nothing left to live for that ' s it , " said Boucard , who added that she can ' t be expected to control how someone chooses to respond to seeing an email inbox full of attacks about their outdated clothing and lack of a social life when they wake up every morning . " So I ' m supposed to just hold back from spreading an almost unending stream of false rumors about her sex life and telling her suicide was the best way out ? What am I , her mommy ?" Learn to take a joke , " she added .At press time , several of Gordon ' s friends confirmed that when she told them she couldn ' t take it anymore for five straight months , they assumed she was only kidding . 	 1
if the first casualty of war is the truth, maybe the second is common sense. it s become common to declare that europe s borderless travel zone must go if security is to be restored after the terrorist attacks in paris. before abandoning part of the european union s most popular achievement? freedom of movement? let s think it through. the argument goes roughly like this : because borderless travel, established in stages through the 1990s and 2000s, never secured europe s external frontier and intelligence sharing, and because the european union is too feckless to make that happen now, the best recourse is to resurrect national borders and put the maintenance of security back into the hands of national governments. three pieces of evidence are generally provided. first, the paris attacks were planned in belgium, a divided state with an ineffectual intelligence service that allowed the brussels district of molenbeek to become a safe zone for europe s extremists. belgium s failures thus became the problems of its neighbours, too. exhibit no. 2 is that abdelhamid abaaoud, the leader of the paris attacks, was able to travel from syria to brussels and back again in 2014, without detection. finally, weapons : belgium has a lively black market in arms that can be bought by extremists and brought onto a train or driven to points anywhere in the eu to launch an attack. shut the borders, the theory goes, and belgium s failure to clamp down on its illegal arms trade becomes less concerning. it would be absurd to argue that these failures didn t occur. but would repetition be prevented if europe s internal borders were permanently resurrected, as france has done temporarily after the paris attacks? the first thing to say is that even when there were border controls between the 26 european countries that are signatories to the schengen agreement that established the free travel zone from 1995, traffic flows were so great that most cars were waved through, unchecked. that was in the 1980s and 90s, when cars drove at least 500 million fewer passenger miles per year across europe than they do now. restoring europe s internal borders today would be like putting border checks on state lines between new york and washington. how many cars travelling on highway i 95 would actually be stopped? let s say systematic checks were made, turning i 95 into a car park. even then it would be no panacea. on the night after the paris attacks, french police set up checks along the road to belgium and stopped belgian born salah abdeslam, the one paris gunman who didn t detonate his suicide belt, three times, according to the lawyer of the man who helped him escape. the police let abdeslam go because they didn t recognise him. the manhunt continues. how about weapons? europe s illegal small arms trade draws on weapons that weren t registered when tougher regulations were imposed in countries such as france. it also involves arms trafficked from the ex yugoslav countries ( where bosnians alone are estimated to hold 750, 000 private guns left over from the war ), and weapons that were neutralised for sale as souvenirs or props and are subsequently reactivated. restoring europe s internal borders might help a little with one part of this trade? imports from the western balkans? but not by much, according to nicholas marsh, a firearms researcher at the peace research institute oslo. here s how he described to me the difference between the size of hammer the eu would wield by ending schengen, and the tiny nail it would be trying to hit : even before schengen came along, you could drive through europe with hardly any checks at all. given the amount of commerce and travel, that would be extremely difficult to change now. then you have the likely number of weapons being trafficked, we re talking about a very small number into france per year, no more than a few hundred. so imagine a car carrying 5 or 10 kalashnikovs, what is the chance of that car being searched on way into france? you d be better off playing the lottery. far more than in the us, where there is a mass consumer market for small arms, this is a problem that can be addressed only by intelligence and undercover police penetrating the buyers and dealers in organised crime gangs. disturbingly, says marsh, who co wrote a recent united nations report on arms smuggling, europe s governments have less information on the trade on their territories than do their counterparts in latin america. putting belgium in an isolation bubble wouldn t fix the problem, either. according to a 2010 french government estimate, there were about 4, 000 automatic rifles circulating in paris suburbs such as saint denis, where abaaoud was found and killed. someone determined enough to give up his life is unlikely to be deterred from finding a gun in paris, if the softer belgian option is closed. to address the terrorist threat, europe s governments would need to do what they should do 	 0
EAGLE , CO Unable to land a contract with an NBA team willing to let him pursue his goal of winning a championship all by himself , Kobe Bryant was granted his own expansion team on the steps of the Eagle , Colorado courthouse after the 45th day of arcane pre trial hearings yesterday . He will be the Eagle Ego ' s owner , GM , coach and only player .The , uh , team will play the season in the 1 . 7 billion , 18 , 000 seat Wackenhut Centre in downtown Eagle . The state of the art arena will feature such amenities as : 25 medium security and 40 maximum security luxury suites private phone booths a jewellery boutique an on site duty counsel office and the swank , 1 , 500 capacity Posse Lounge .The team name was chosen from a short list of finalists that included the Kobes , the Bryants , and the KBs .League commissioner David Stern scoffed at the risk of giving Bryant a team in light of his upcoming rape trial . " My lawyers say he ' s out in two max even if he does get time in the cooler . And in 2005 06 , he ' d be locked down while the rest of the league is locked out anyway , so it ' s really only a one year gamble . Speaking of gambling , didn ' t we let Jordan retire for two years instead of suspending him for gambling away the gross domestic product of Tanzania ? Kobe ' s got that same kind of marketing cachet the NBA ' s brand ' s association with narcissism and rampant lawlessness . "Stern said that the league will release two schedules for the upcoming season , to accommodate for the possibility that Bryant may have to play all his games at home if prison prevents him from crossing state lines .Bryant will be allowed to collect the league ' s full team salary cap amount , which will no doubt help legal bills that are , well , skying like Kobe himself . Stern did impose a special clause which prohibits Bryant from spending more than 25 of this money on guilt bling bling for his wife Vanessa ." I imagine he ' ll run the same offense that we saw for most of the Pistons series throwing up wild shots with six hands in his face with a few seconds left on the shot clock , " said defrocked announcer Marv Albert . " He ' ll need to average about 225 points a game and I just don ' t see it happening even if he is so accustomed to playing one on five . "But Portland Trail Blazers ' owner Paul Allen expressed fear of his new division rival . " I just hope my players don ' t give away our playbook during exercise time . "Former Lakers ' coach Phil Jackson ' s reaction was mixed . " I won nine titles with teams that basically played two on five , so I can see Kobe maybe sliding into the seventh or eighth playoff seed in the West . But if there ' s one player who could bitch about not getting enough shots as the only guy on his team , it ' s Kobe , " said the Zen Master over the unmistakable sound of gurgling bongwater .Bryant was unable to comment due to a court imposed gag order . 	 1
joy behar and her co hosts on " the view " were recently named on the time 100 most influential list. " the view " co host discussed a variety of topics, including the miss california usa pageant, her feud with donald trump and alaska gov. sarah palin's political future. the following is an edited version of the interview. larry king : it looks like donald trump has made up with barbara ( walters ). how are you and donald now? joy behar : you would not believe how friendly he was to me today at " the view. " the man was all over me. first of all, in the green room after the show, he actually kissed me. i don't think that he kisses anybody. he came up to me and he actually kissed me and hugged me. it was weird. king : because he criticized you, as you know, in the past. behar : well, he said that you hit me hard and so i went back at you. i don't remember even what i said. i made a joke about his hair, i think. but, you know, i'm done with that anyway. it's an old story. i'm not interested in his hair anymore, and we're fine. watch behar dishking : what did you make of ( the controversy with miss california usa ), joy? behar : this miss california girl, i think she's doing great. i mean who even thinks of miss usa? nobody even knows miss usa exists. she's got a great career ahead of her now, where everybody sees how gorgeous she is. she's winning the race, believe me, and with new boobs. who can ask for anything more? king : what do you think of the fact that your program made the ( time magazine ) most influential list? view the listbehar : that is my favorite, that we are on the most influential list. i never thought i would see this day. i just feel like good, now i can have some influence on ahmadinejad, ( benjamin ) netanyahu. maybe i can have some influence on the world. king : elizabeth edwards, as we all know, is battling breast cancer, coping with the fallout of her husband's infidelity, selling a new book, too. what do you make of that whole situation, joy? behar : you know, what is it with these political wives who love to stand by their men? i happen to like elizabeth edwards very much. she's been on the show and i've met her a couple of times. she's a really nice person, and he's a dog, you know? let's tell it like it is. he's a dog and people don't like him. i think his political career is over, and it's disappointing because he was a decent democrat. he had his heart in the right place. he was a good liberal, and now he's out of the picture. although it didn't stop newt gingrich, who also told his wife he wanted a divorce when she was in the hospital. so, you know, bad taste, i guess, doesn't hurt all of their careers. so we never know what's going to happen to him. i just feel bad for her. king : let's move to another politician, sarah palin. what's your read on the governor? behar : well, you know, they're talking about her as the new republican party. if that's what they want for their new republican party, that's fine somebody who doesn't believe in a woman's choice, someone who doesn't believe in evolution, someone who is, you know, loves to hunt and kill animals or whatever. i don't know what her reasoning is. then fine.... and doesn't really believe in global warming. she and rush limbaugh constantly are talking about how there's no problem. i mean this guy, rush limbaugh, i used to work with him years ago, and i've sort of been friendly with him in a certain weird kind of way. he constantly is talking about how there is no global warming. every climatologist in the world says there's global warming. every scientist has said there is a problem. we're all on this earth together and this guy goes out and says that there's no global warming. who is he? what is he talking about and who are these ditto heads that agree with him, i'd like to know? aren't they breathing the same air that we are? king : do you think palin will be a presidential ( candidate )? do you think she's going to get up pretty close to getting that nomination? behar : oh, i 	 0
rupert murdoch threw a grenade. j. k. rowling caught it in midair and lobbed it back. the explosion in the battlefield of social media injured the truth. murdoch, the conservative media magnate, never afraid to ruffle liberal feathers, tweeted that muslims " must be held responsible " for " their growing jihadist cancer. " rowling, the creator of harry potter, deployed her rhetorical mastery. " i was born christian, " she tweeted back. " if that makes rupert murdoch my responsibility, i'll auto excommunicate. " at last count, more than 20, 000 people had re tweeted her. the comedian aziz ansari shot back, " rups can we get a step by step guide? how can my 60 year old parents in nc help destroy terrorist groups? plz advise. " there are few subjects as sensitive as easy to get wrong as the role of islam and the responsibility of the world's muslims in the terrorist barbarism plaguing much of the world today. murdoch is wrong. muslims, all muslims, are not responsible for what happened. but that's not the end of it. rowlings, ansari and the tens of thousands who favorite their tweets are right in saying this is not the fault of all muslims, nor is it exclusively up to them, all of them, to take on the battle. but the tweets leave out a fundamental part of the problem. muslims have a crucial role to play in fighting extremist acts committed in the name of their religion and, indeed, many of them are doing it. from social media to the highest spheres of power, there are muslims demanding reform, demanding reaffirmation of individual freedoms and rejecting violence. ansari's parents need not drop everything they're doing and head for the fight against isis. but individuals, in this era of high connectivity, can argue for their beliefs. ansari, for one, with a large following and gift for communicating his views, has the ability to advance the conversation away from both extremes. there are people to persuade on all sides, not just that murdoch is wrong, but also that the ideology of the terrorists is wrong. a pew poll of 14, 244 people in 14 countries with large muslim populations revealed a few months ago, significant minorities of muslims believe suicide bombings are " justified to defend islam from its enemies. " in bangladesh 47 said suicide bombings are acceptable, in gaza 62 agreed, in egypt 24 did. those are alarming numbers, a sign that murderous extremism is indeed a problem, one that muslims should view with urgency, not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings, of terrorism of all kinds, kills muslims. thousands of muslims, including europeans, have joined the viciously violent isis which, by some accounts, enjoys the support of a rather large minority of french and european muslims. that is excellent news for europe's extreme right wing politicians, who have built their careers on racism and religious prejudice most recently against muslims and immigrants from muslim countries and have found a populist sweet spot in the carnage. after the killings at charlie hebdo and the subsequent siege and murder of jewish shoppers at a paris kosher market, the stage is set for anti immigrant parties to make gains in europe. and the barbarism ranges well beyond : hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in nigeria by the islamist terrorist group, boko haram, whose name applies the islamic term " haram " what is forbidden to boko, a word used to described a western education. even as the media was focused on paris, boko haram slaughtered thousands more in nigeria, including many children, wiping out entire villages. these attacks should bring together a coalition spanning the political spectrum, including muslims, christians and jews, conservatives and liberals, the overwhelming majorities of whom favor the defense of personal freedoms. and muslims should stand in the vanguard of that coalition, with their arms thrown across the shoulders of jews, signifying rejection of the intolerance that has made itself at home among far too many of their coreligionists. there is a war of ideas raging in the muslim world. the prize is the soul of modern islam. it's not enough to say this is not my fault. terrorists say they fight on behalf of muslims. muslims cannot be mere bystanders. but there is a well meaning segment of the population, particularly among the left, that stubbornly tries to deny the religious context of the terrorist attacks and the need for it to be addressed within muslim communities. by doing this, the left and the center push people to the right that is, people who agree with murdoch's views. this is because many voters know the denial is dishonest or blind. those who close their eyes to the religiously inspired motivation of the killers, and of their religion inspired goals, are just as mistaken. are all 	 0
Tripoli , Libya Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi has issued his terms of surrender from his secret compound here . The former strongman and sunglass aficionado provided only one condition for giving himself up to NATO authorities ." I want to join the cast of ' Keeping up with the Kardashians , ' " Gaddafi said . " I think I would be terrific in the role of Uncle Muammar . "" The girls need a father figure that they can look up to , " the dictator added . " I have been father of my country for decades , so this part is made for me . "Gaddafi has no experience as a performer or entertainer . In fact , many Libyans found his occasional television appearances to be quite painful ." If you didn ' t applaud loudly enough at his remarks , he would have your palms set on fire , " one unnamed citizen said . " You ' d be surprised how many standing ovations that trick produced . "Asked about his lack of talent and experience , Gaddafi had the reporter who fielded the question shot . Then he responded : " Lack of talent and experience . . . Such things make me feel like I ' m already a member of the family . "A Kardashian spokesperson refused comment , but it has been widely reported how the clan recently turned a family wedding into a multimillion dollar moneymaker . " If Gaddafi comes up with the right dollar amount , he ' s in , " observed one television executive .As Gaddafi issued his terms of surrender , a photo album filled with pictures of former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice surfaced in one of his captured compounds . " Oh yes , I have quite the crush on Condi , " he said . " And I would make her part of my Kardashian dream . Everything goes nice with a little Rice . " 	 1
ORLANDO , FL Disgusted with the total childishness of those around her , 13 year old Alexis Keefe announced Monday that she can ' t believe how immature everyone is ." Everyone in the world is , like , so immature , " said Keefe , rolling her eyes at a group of boys playing dodgeball during lunch recess . " I mean , when are people going to grow up ? We ' re in eighth grade now , but everyone still runs around and plays baby games and acts completely retarded all the time . "In addition to the juvenile behavior of her classmates , Keefe is forced to endure the immaturity of her younger sister , who doesn ' t even know what fractions are the produce manager at the grocery store , who whistles constantly the youth group leader at her family ' s church , who wants everyone to hold hands like they ' re in nursery school the clerk with all the buttons at Payless Shoes and , worst of all , her parents ." My dad is always singing these dumb songs and telling stupid knock knock jokes . I mean , get real . Knock knock jokes ? That is , like , so third grade , " Keefe said . " Plus , he always calls pajamas ' PJs . ' Excuse me ? "Her father , Richard Keefe , admitted that he does get " a little silly " sometimes , but stressed that he is making every effort to be respectful of his daughter ' s exceptional maturity ." Alexis is quickly becoming a young woman , so her mother and I are always trying to think of family activities that take this into account , " Keefe said . " We ' ve come to find that this excludes such infantile activities as holding family sing alongs , getting Blizzards at Dairy Queen , watching Animal Planet , visiting Grandma , shopping at Sears , swimming at the public pool , going to the planetarium , playing Frisbee , and pretty much anything else that requires Alexis to leave her room or get out of the car . "Even Keefe ' s best friends have come under fire for their immaturity . " I really like Becky Christopher and Jen Ingrassia , but sometimes they ' re totally embarrassing to be around . I mean , Becky goes to karate class , and Jen listens to Z 96 . How immature can you be ? "Added Keefe : " Sometimes I think Becky and Jen need to go back to Miss Schukal ' s kindergarten class or wear diapers or something . "Among other things Keefe avoids at all costs : stuffed animals , pancakes , mittens as opposed to gloves , digital watches , pencils instead of pens , cotton candy , animated movies , sandals , yo yos , ponytail holders , sack lunches and white nylons ." We should consider ourselves lucky to have such a discriminating individual in our midst , " said Marjorie Schu , Keefe ' s guidance counselor at Eastlake Junior High School . " It was only two years ago that Alexis was a watchdog for all things that were ' boring , ' and before that she was foremost in her class in pointing out things that were ' gay . ' "" What will be next ? " Schu asked . " Will she move on to combat the ' lameness ' that surrounds her , or will she choose to speak out against things that are ' fake ' or ' cheap ' ? I guess all we can do is wait and see . " 	 1
Farmer friendly version of drug will ease liberal consciences . Consumer groups yesterday lent their support to the launch of new fair trade ' cocaine in north west London . The move , by Jason Jay ' Myers of Stonebridge Park , came after years of campaigning by third world activists , children ' s rights groups and various other left wing rabble .The new brand of the illicit Class A narcotic will go on sale at 55 per gram , slightly more expensive than that offered by conventional dealers . But stated Myers from his home in the crime ridden London slum , ' It is well worth it . Conventional coke trafficking consortiums make huge profits but give little to the grower , while we aim to give the small , independent cocaine producer a better deal . So while the consumer can still enjoy the feelings of unstoppable confidence followed by hopeless paranoia , the small farmer in the developing gets a little more to feed his family . You get me . 'Under the scheme the extra 5 will go to the growers in Columbia , Myers stated , before adding : honestly . ' Speaking from behind his reinforced steel door on the Kier Hardie Estate , a 20 storey concrete vision of hell , the twice convicted 30 year old assured consumers that the extra money spent would be worth it . ' I think people have to look to their consciences in this matter ' the seventeen stone bodybuilder and father of seven illegitimate children added .The move received a mixed response from cocaine users , who compose about 10 of the capital ' s population . PR industry twat Julian Wilkins for one is in favour ' I think it ' s really great . We ' ve all got to look after each other in this world . It ' s really great ' he said at the end of a twenty minute drug induced rant . While hedgefund tossbag Sebastian Montegue had mixed feelings : It ' s all very well encouraging an ethical product if the market backs it up , but the real test comes when the recession comes ' , before chopping up another line with a gold credit card .But poorer consumers were more sceptical about the scheme to help Colombian growers . Said King ' s Cross resident Marky Williamson : ' You think I ' m giving another fiver for some bloke in Africa or somewhere ? Have you got a pound ? My sister ' s in hospital and I need to get the bus . 'Rival distributors were sceptical of the move . One group , the West Harlesden Posse , said it planned to force Myers out of the market through a mixture of aggressive marketing .On Page 9 : Supermarket unveils ' Organic Heroin ' 	 1
As a teenager who basically lives at Disney World , Lily Mock has been on virtually every ride at the Florida amusement park . But no ride has been as surprising as the monorail from Magic Kingdom to Epcot center .A power outage Sunday evening forced the evacuation of about 120 passengers from the monorail , Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said .She said weather caused the power outage , but it did not appear a lightning strike was responsible .Lily said the sky was filled with dark clouds when she , her parents and siblings boarded the monorail around 6 p . m ." When we sat there , we heard a lot of thunder and saw a few bolts of lightning , " the 15 year old said .Suddenly , with the monorail about 30 feet in the air , the train came to a halt ." It wasn ' t a jolting stop , but it did stop really fast the monorail glided to a stop , " Lily said .Without the air conditioner running , the train car got pretty hot over the next 90 minutes .As they waited for firefighters to help them off , the stranded visitors passed the time by chatting with each other and messaging friends . No one seemed to panic , Lily said .Firefighters later managed to pop open the top hatch of the train car but opted to escort passengers out through the doors , using a lift .That actually disappointed Lily ." I kind of wanted to go through the top , I thought it ' d be fun , " she said .Despite the mishap , Lily said she ' ll definitely be back especially after getting free passes for the inconvenience .And for a teen who visits Disney World at least three times a year , the experience was actually pretty cool ." I just kept saying this is the most exclusive ride , having to evacuate the monorail , " Lily said .Her mother , Melissa Mock , has been visiting Disney World since she was 8 years old . She describes the family as a bunch of " Disney philes " and didn ' t mind the surprise at all ." It was the single most exciting thing that ' s happened to us since we ' ve been visiting in 30 years , " she said .Six Flags coaster car derails , 4 injuredDozens stuck for 4 hours in SeaWorld San Diego ride after power failure 	 0
the recent ordeal of meriam yahia ibrahim ishag, a sudanese mother and wife of an american citizen coupled with iran's continued imprisonment of saeed abedini, also an american citizen and a pastor should awaken our conscience to one grim and inescapable fact : the persecution of christians continues. charged with leaving islam to marry a christian, despite being raised a christian and remaining one throughout her 27 years, meriam was sentenced to death last month for apostasy. after an international outcry, she was released, rearrested, and released again, according to the u. s. state department. in sudan and iran, as well as countries like saudi arabia, leaders and movements impose their own extreme interpretations of islam, while restricting the rights of christians and other religious minorities. elsewhere in the middle east, mass violence as well as repression arises from such movements. in iraq and syria, forces of the islamic state of iraq and syria ( isis ) commit horrific abuses against christians and others, from torture to murder. in egypt, scores of churches and other christian structures were burned by radicals last autumn following president mohamed morsy's fall. while christians faced repression under prior regimes like hosni mubarak's, their predicament has worsened in a post arab spring world. 7 terrible countries for christianswith media attention riveted on the middle east, it is tempting to assume that persecution against christians occurs almost exclusively in that region. but assaults against christians are worldwide, transcending any one regional, ideological, or religious bent. combating this problem entails a much broader solution. according to the findings of the u. s. commission on international religious freedom ( uscirf ), evidence abounds of persecution elsewhere. in myanmar ( also known as burma ), with a buddhist majority and a struggling democracy, ethnic minority christians, along with rohingya muslims, have faced ongoing abuses. last year, during military incursions in kachin state, as many as 60 churches were shelled. military forces have beaten and arrested christian leaders and kidnapped church members for forced labor. in china, the world's most populous nation, catholics and protestants refusing to register with the communist dictatorship face arrests and fines, and their churches are shuttered. china's government has issued a directive to " eradicate " unregistered protestant churches over the next decade, and even registered churches have recently been bulldozed in zhejiang province. in eritrea, a military regime jails up to 3, 000 people, mostly evangelical or pentecostal christians, on religious grounds. prisoners have been beaten and tortured. in interviews with uscirf, released prisoners reported being confined in 20 foot metal shipping containers with extreme temperature fluctuations. in india, the world's largest democracy, christians face harassment and violence, especially in states with laws restricting religious conversion from hinduism. in nigeria, the central government fails to protect christians, as well as muslims, from boko haram terrorism. in north korea, a totalitarian tyranny with a cult of personality venerating the ruling kim family, the government imprisons, tortures, and executes christians caught transporting bibles or engaging in missionary endeavors or other banned activities. north koreans who flee for china and then convert to christianity are in grave danger when forcibly returned. punishment includes beatings, torture, forced labor, sexual violence, and forced abortions or infanticide. in pakistan, christians face a government that can imprison them unjustly under blasphemy laws while failing to protect them from attacks or punish their attackers. last september, suicide bombers launched the worst assault against christians in pakistan's history, leaving, according to conservative estimates, at least 80 dead and more than 150 other parishioners wounded at a peshawar church. in vietnam, a communist government suppresses independent protestants and other groups operating without government approval. the regime seeks to stop their growth through discrimination, violence, and forced renunciations of faith. opinion : extremism fuels abuse of christians in mideastand in a host of post soviet countries, christians in unregistered churches are seriously constrained. in several of these countries, including uzbekistan, individuals are in prison for belonging to such churches. abuses against christians span the globe. a key reason is the confluence of two factors. first, there are more than 2 billion christians in the world. second, according to a pew research study, in one third of all nations, containing 75 of the world's people, governments either perpetrate or tolerate serious religious freedom abuses. a six year pew study found that over six years, christians were harassed in 151 countries, the largest of any group surveyed. in other words, given their enormous numbers and wide dispersion across nations, as well as the lack of freedom in many nations, it is no surprise how often christians are persecuted. christians are often regarded as alien because some are members 	 0

In a bizarre veterinary accident , Princess Anne has been put down instead of her Bull Terrier , Florence . The Princess Royal had decided to kill her beloved pet after the dog had first torn apart one of her mothers Corgis then bit one of the maids at the Queen ' s Sandingham Estate . However , Royal Veterinarian Haggis McCloud accidentally injected Anne with a lethal dose of Phenobarbital instead of Florence ." It was an honest mistake , " moaned Dr McCloud , " a bull terrier is a stocky breed of dog with powerful jaws and the Princess is . . . well . . . "While the Royal Family has officially stated the death of Princess Anne was a tragic accident , insiders are hinting at something darker . Queen Elizabeth has been quoted by an anonymous source ( Harold Stinky ' Wegman ) as saying once after a bit too much port , " No one kills ones dogs without severe repercussions . Kill the Bitch . "Insiders are at a loss in trying to determine which Royal this particular maid was sleeping with or whether she has signed any tell all book deals previous to the biting incident .It should be remembered that Anne in November of 2002 was the first British Royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years after she failed to stop another of her dogs , Dottie from biting two children . At this time it is unclear which of the Royal Family the two children were sleeping with or whether they have signed any tell all book deals previous to the biting incident .Funeral arrangements have yet to be determined , but interment has been scheduled at the Happy Dale Pet Cemetery in Yorkshire .Approved by Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse 	 1

He is going to be discharged in the next 24 hours , " said the Scot , " but they say that the chest pains were brought on by the extreme pressure of managing Villa . "SHITE SPELLINGVilla have been shite all season , and it ' s this , as well as the frustration Houlier feels from constantly spelling his own name wrongly , that have ' pushed him to his limit ' , in the medical sense ."

A gardener thought he was going quackers after spotting two tomatoes growing in his greenhouse in the shape of rubber ducks .George Wall , 80 , picked the bizarrely shaped fruit forming from a tomato plant in his back garden .The pensioner said the deformed tomatoes had made him something of a celebrity on his street in Shrewsbury , Shropshire .Quackers : Gardener George Wall couldn ' t believe it when he found two duck shaped tomatoes ( pictured ) growing in his greenhouseGeorge Wall , pictured , said the deformed tomatoes had made him something of a celebrity on his street in Shrewsbury , ShropshireDozens of neighbours have visited to have a look at the little red and yellow ' ducks ' which his wife Mary , 76 , kept hidden to stop George eating them .The couple are now planning to store their prized produce in their fridge until the tomatoes rot .The retired lorry driver said he was amazed to find not only one , but two duck shaped tomatoes staring back up at him .The grandfather of four , who has been gardening for 30 years , said : ' We were very surprised that they looked like ducks .Dozens of neighbours have visited to have a look at the little red and yellow ' ducks ' , pictured left and right' We ' ve got about eight plants in the greenhouse and as my wife went down to pick them she saw the shape of them and left them to develop .' But they were beginning to grow too big and heavy for the plant so we picked them .' Mary had to keep them out of my reach while they were growing because fresh tomatoes off the plant are too tempting for me .' It is a complete freak of nature and I don ' t think it will ever happen again . To get one is rare enough but to get two little ducks was incredible . 'Mrs Wall added : ' I couldn ' t get rid of them , they are just too cute .' I have kept them in the fridge and they are starting to go off , but there ' s no way we ' d use them .'

Los Angeles , CA So an ophthalmologist and a psychoanalyst get on an elevator . . . This may sound like the start of a great joke , but in actuality it was the beginning of a terrifying descent into unprofessional chaos .Jorge Valdez , a once highly respected surgeon specializing in rare diseases of the eye had just received devastating news of his temporary medical license suspension after delivering , what he believed was a breakthrough discovery in his field . He said at the National Eye Institute Conference ( held on the 20th floor of the Hilton Hotel ) that vitreous detachments ( aka floaters ) in the eye weren ' t what they seemed ." Over the past 32 years of chatting with patients during eye exams , I ' ve found those complaining of floaters were most likely to have had imaginary friends in childhood . I therefore believe that these people may in fact be seeing apparitions of these companions which have long been neglected . This may be more of a psychical or spiritual matter rather than an ocular one . "Needless to say things went down hill from there . The word crazy was thrown around quite a bit .Meanwhile on the 31st floor a another medical doctor was having a rough evening .Jonathon Rosenblatt , an up and coming psychoanalyst was asked to leave the American Psychoanalytic Association due to his patients recovering from their ails too quickly .Rick Stern M . D . , PhD . was quoted as saying " Psychoanalysis is about giving the analysand the dignity of being understood as a complex individual , worthy of full self realization . This is not a quick and simple processes . Fifteen years , for one hour five days a week is average . Eight years starts to raise eyebrows . This Rosenblatt kid had people in and out in 6 months feeling great . While I don ' t begrudge or deny the results and welfare of his patients what he is practicing is definitely not analysis !The ElevatorWhat police have pieced together is something along the lines of two men , both professionals , crossing paths at the worst possible time .Dr Valdez ' s account :" I had just been laughed at and called a lunatic by people who I thought had enough professional courtesy to hear a new , albeit radical idea . It was sort of like a sign , or so I thought when the elevator doors open and there stands someone who could validate my sanity . Next thing I know we ' re rolling on the floor and I ' m sure he threw the first punch . He ' s angry , immature , most likely jealous that my field is more respected as a science than his . "Dr Rosenblatt wasn ' t available for comment , but his lawyer , Joe Levinson , said " On the night of the alleged incident the elevator doors opened and a man , who by the subjective appearance of my client , seemed to be an inebriated anti Semitic immigrant of some sort ranting about ghost . He was in imminent fear of his life and did defend himself . "Neither the Dr , the Lawyer , or the police would speculate if alcohol was a factor . One thing is for sure , both men left with faces as bruised as their egos . 	 1
POMONA , California David Archuleta and Demi Lovato were recently seen at a McDonalds sharing an order or Chicken McNuggets .The two teen singing sensations were having a good time throwing the McNuggets into each others mouths . David did not miss hitting Demi ' s open mouth once . Demi missed David ' s open mouth four times , the last time striking a little blue haired old lady in the next booth .The woman identified as Beaulah Bickenfigger , 94 , of nearby Chino started hollering and saying that they had hit her on her ear on purpose and that it was bleeding .The restaurant manager Choo Choo Pallanucki , 43 , said that it was not blood but ketchup that Mrs Bickenfigger was seeing dripping down from her ear , onto her blue gingham blouse , and onto her Big Mac burger .She immediately asked for another Big Mac . Palanucki asked her if she had the receipt . She looked at him and told him that he was crazy , stupid , dumb , and full of rodent droppings .Pallannucki looked at her and said that he would not be talking if he was her , with her silly ass looking blue hair , her nose the size of a large carrot , and a pair of sagging tits that it appeared to him she was most likely sitting on .Mrs Bickenfigger produced the receipt and told Pallanucki to make himself useful and go into the kitchen and get her a brand new Big Mac .Archuleta and Lovato overheard all of this and they walked over to where Mrs Bickenfigger sat . They asked her if she would like a bit of their Chicken McNuggets . She looked up at both of them and asked , " And just who might you two buttinski ' s be ? "David reached down , picked up the McNuggets he has placed in front of her , and told her that she really needs to stop being so friggin bitter .Demi agreed with David and added that a little old woman like her really should act more like a nice old lady instead of acting like that mean , vulgar bitch Naomi Campbell , except only white , shorter , and not as fat assed .Bickenfigger told the two to leave her the eff alone . She said that she is sick and tired of every day having to deal with Nazi ' s , KKK ' ers , GOP ' ers , atheists , and used car salesman .SIDENOTE : Nineteen year old David Archuleta and 17 year old Demi Lovato will soon be going on a 59 city tour of Mexico entitled The Demi Lovato and David Archuleta Wholesome South of The Border Train of Music Concert Tour Featuring A Trio of Vuvuzela Players . 	 1
The water in Flint is still not safe to drink because city and state officials are violating the federal law that protects drinking water , Dimple Chaudhary , an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council , said in a statement .The state is also working to map out exactly where the old lead pipes are in Flint so it can come up with the proper priorities about how we replace that infrastructure , Snyder said .Despite concerns expressed by the residents regarding the issue , the government officials still insisted that the water is safe to use , and there is no cause for alarm .Brooks says Snyder s regret for what has happened appears genuine .Snyder and staff did not speak to reporters .The matter has been discussed on social media , particularly by filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore . Flint Mayor Karen Williams Weaver is a 1980 Tougaloo College graduate .The water crisis in Flint , Michigan and the toll it s taken on the city have captured nation s attention .There could be many more , Gov . Rick Snyder told CNN , and we re assuming that .First Ward Councilwoman Beth Gillman asked Petersen s opinion on the shape of the pipes carrying water to homes and if there was a threat of lead leaching into the water like in Flint .Snyder declared a state of emergency in Flint on January 5 and then activated the Michigan National Guard , which has been assisting with water distribution efforts . After the April 2014 switch , residents complained their water looked , smelled and tasted amusing . High lead levels have since been found in some children .The subpoenas call for the release of emails , text messages and other documents sent or received by the Republican governor , his office and emergency managers relating to the Flint River as a water source , reports MLive .The test results were so disturbing , he stood outside City Hall and urged residents not to drink what was coming out of their taps .Whether conscious or not , Flint officials dismissing complaints from the community is an example of prejudice through willful ignorance .Democratic U . S . Sens . Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow and U . S . Rep . Dan Kildee of MI said Wednesday that they will introduce legislation to clarify the Environmental Protection Agency s authority to notify the public if a danger from lead is in their water system .Michigan Lt . Governor Brian Calley addressed the water crisis in Flint with WWJ .One of the prior suits alleges there is no sovereign immunity because the water switch denied residents their federal constitutional rights to bodily integrity and to be free from state created danger .I have family members from Fayette , Mississippi , and other places where there s is darker toned water but to know that it s actually people in America drinking water that has lead poisoning , said Williams .Other samples collected by the EPA from throughout the system show chlorine is present but levels in some areas could be improved .It remains unclear how badly the lead service lines were damaged by the river water . 	 0
QUEENS , New York The gangsta rapper who goes by the name of 50 cent got his nose all bent out of shape when he was refused admittance to The Lips of The Dastardly Dragon Japanese Restaurant in Queens .According to The Right Coast Illustrated Revue Curtis James Jackson , III , aka 50 cent , was refused entrance by the restaurant ' s 6 foot 8 inch head of security Hiroki Gollyweiser .When the " Half Dollar " asked why he would not be allowed inside he was told that the management and the entire staff did not appreciate him making his Gilbert Gottfried smut type jokes about the victims of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami .EDITOR ' S NOTE : 50 Cent stated that the tsunami was serious and that he had to evacuate all of his ho ' s from L . A . , Hawaii , and Japan .50 Cent said that he only made that remark and others for the ' Shock Value . ' When asked why he would want to shock anyone with such cruel remarks Jackson looked down at the thousands of dollars of bling bling on his chest and answered , " Because dat ' s just da way I be ' s . . . dat ' s what 50 Cent fans ' spect from me and dat ' s why I says what I says when I says it . "Mr Gollyweiser did not buy the 5 cent worth of crapola that 50 Cent put out .Jackson then told Gollyweiser that back in 2000 he had been shot nine times and that showed that he needs to be treated with some respect , especially since he is a native of Queens .He then added that he has sold millions and millions of hip hop , rip rap , gangsta grunge records including " How To Rob , " " How To Be Bitch Slappin ' On Da Bitches , " " How To Make Da Ho ' s Do What Da Eff Dey S ' pose Ta Be Doin ' , " and one of his biggest hits , " Jimmy Crack Corn Be One Upset Bro ' Cause His Crack Ho She Don ' t Be Givin ' One Bling Blinging Friggin Damn Fa Shizzle Ma Nizzle Shitola . "Gollyweiser was unimpressed and remarked that if he did not leave the front of the restaurant he was going to do one of two things either call the police or pick up his 50 Cent ass and toss him in the restaurant ' s dumpster located in the side alley .50 Cent left muttering something to the effect that , that ' s the last time he ' s going to be making a remark about the weather . 	 1
In the 1970s New Zealand Comic and song writer Fred Dag often spoke about a Government Level conspiracy to Hoard Oil Reserves in Huge Rubber Bladders .He ascertained from Government leaked papers that the Oil Bladders would be buried Deep in the Sahara Desert with Bladders from other Nations , and would be tapped into at the desired time sometime in the future .It appears all the Government staff that worked on the project have either disappeared or died and along with them the secret hiding place of the Bladders .It also appears that the leaked papers were purposely misleading in the location of the Badders , says Fred Dag , who has dedicated his life to discovering the hidden Bladders and has to date dug 230 , 507 holes in the Desert in an effort to unearth the Oil .Recently An Exploratory Oil Company announced the " discovery " of a Huge Oil Reserve off the South Eastern Shores of New Zealand . They say the reserve is in deep water off the coast and will be costly to retrieve .Coincidently , we found an excited Fred Dag on a wet afternoon in a small pub in name deleted for security reasons .After swearing us to secrecy Fred informs us that he has been investigating the Oil Find , and has discovered in the deep reaches of ocean off the south Eastern shores off New Zealand what appears to be a large rubbery surface approximately 2 kilometres long , and 500 metres wide , 1 2 buried in the soft sands off the coast in about 1500 meters of water .He is quite positive after carrying out seismic studies that the substance contained in the Bladder is Oil and has approached the New Zealand Government for the sole rights to recover the rubber Bladder and its contents ." My rights will be first " says Fred , because " I registered my search for a large rubber bladder of Oil in 1974 and now I ' ve found the bladder , its mine "" We don ' t know how lucky we are " , says Fred , " We don ' t how lucky we are " 	 1
new york actress bianca astor, 22, was excited to be cast in the role of a woman who suffers from anorexia nervosa for a filmed public service announcement monday. " i can't believe it! " astor said upon receiving the call from her agent. " i honestly didn't think i was going to get the part. i'm pretty thin, but i didn't think i was eating disorder thin. i guess i am! " the spot for the national association of anorexia nervosa and associated disorders is part of a campaign designed to raise the public's awareness of eating disorders. according to anad statistics, 1 in 100 adolescent girls suffers from anorexia. " the cool thing is that i'll be helping to make a difference, " astor said. " besides appearing in the tv ads, i'll also be on billboards and the sides of buses. everyone in the country will see me as the super skinny girl. " " this will look really good on my r sum, " astor added. " i tried to pick glossies that were flattering, but this will definitely help drive home the point that i can play thin. " astor has struggled to get her acting career off the ground ever since she moved to new york four years ago. she has modeled sporadically and worked as an extra on several daytime soap operas, and also appeared in two commercials, portraying smiling woman 4 in a gap ad and a fungicidal cream user for lamisil. the anorexia spot marks her first starring role and the first to highlight her extreme boniness. " i was really nervous when i went in for the audition, " astor said. " when i got to the waiting room, i thought,'i'll never be able to compete with all these girls.'i was checking out their hips, and mine were definitely wider than a couple women's. but i guess that in the end, i was the one with the right combination of talent and physique. " astor said she doesn't suffer from an eating disorder, but is lucky enough to have been born with a slight build. " i've just always been thin, ever since junior high, " astor said. " i'm blessed with a fast metabolism. plus, i work out at the gym for three hours a day. and i'm careful to watch what i eat. and i dye my hair because my agent said it makes my face look more defined. " astor's agent, allied arts'debra fayhill, said she's proud of her 5'8 ", 101 pound client. " i'm so excited for her, " fayhill said. " i called her up and told her that the producers thought she was perfect for the role of gretchen, the wholesome 20 ish woman who's starving herself to death. i've never heard anyone scream so loud. " continued fayhill : " not many actresses get a chance to have this sort of impact on young girls. hopefully, she'll really make a big difference in girls'lives, and stick in casting agents'minds when they need a beautiful, hollow eyed wraith. " although few psa actresses have gone on to great success, fayhill said she is optimistic. " look at rachael leigh cook, " fayhill said. " she starred in the 1998'frying pan'anti drug spot from margeotes, fertitta partners, and she went on to play skinny women in the movies. bianca is on the same track. " astor is already practicing her line for the role. according to the script, her ad will open with a close up on a " frail, emaciated hand. " the hand will reach across a restaurant table toward a piece of bread. the camera will pull out to reveal gretchen sitting in a restaurant with a friend. gretchen will change her mind and drop the piece of bread. the friend will ask what's wrong, and gretchen will say, " nothing. " the word will echo eerily as the scene fades out to reveal a grave. " emaciated, " astor said, smiling and examining her hand held at arm's length. after she was selected for the role, astor called her friends to celebrate with a night on the town. " bianca was all,'do you really think i'm thin enough to play an anorexic?'" friend fiona lin said. " all of us kept saying'yes, totally.'she shouldn't doubt herself. she looks fantastic. out of all of us, she so has the most visible rib cage. " not all of astor's friends say she's thin enough for the part. " bianca's thinner than most of us, but she's not very proportional, " friend and fellow actress tia rialto said 	 1
Texas Senator Ted Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night , cementing his status as the conservative front runner and top rival to Donald Trump in the first contest of the 2016 presidential election . The Democratic race was locked in a virtual tie early Tuesday .Tens of thousands of Iowans cast the first votes of 2016 , with reports of record turnout on the Republican side and high turnout in the Democratic race . The contest was set to winnow a wide and fractured Republican field and provide a key test in the Democratic race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton .With about 99 of precincts reporting in the Republican race , Ted Cruz had 28 of the vote , compared with 24 for Trump .The Republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media , Cruz , who is running as a proud scourge of GOP leaders , told cheering supporters in Des Moines . Will not be chosen by the Washington establishment . Will not be chosen by the lobbyists .Whatever Washington says , they cannot keep the people down , Cruz added . Courageous conservatives said , yes we can . 'What appeared to be huge turnout in the Republican race should have benefited Trump , whose campaign hoped high turnout would mean the billionaire businessman was drawing first time caucus goers to the process . But it didn t turn out that way .We never thought Cruz could do this well at this turnout , an official with a rival campaign said .Addressing supporters in West Des Moines , Trump congratulated Cruz and thanked the people of Iowa . We love you . We thank you . We will be back , many , many times . In fact , I might come here and buy a farm , Trump said . And he looked forward to the next contest , where he continues to lead in the polls : On to New Hampshire . So long , everybody .Marco Rubio was close behind Trump in third place with 23 , in line with where his campaign had set expectations after a late surge , but closer to the front of the pack than many had expected . And as he looks to consolidate establishment support after the race moves past Iowa , news broke that popular South Carolina Senator Tim Scott , whose state votes later this month , will endorse Rubio .Addressing enthusiastic supporters in Des Moines , Rubio gave what amounted to a victory speech .So this is the moment they said would never happen , Rubio said . The people of this state have sent a clear message . After seven years of Barack Obama , we aren t waiting any longer .Rubio used the speech , broadcast live nationwide , to make a clear argument that he is the most electable Republican . When I am our nominee , we will unite our party , we will grow our party , and we will defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders , he said .With about 94 of precincts reporting in the Democratic race , Clinton was clinging to a tiny lead over Sanders , with 49 . 9 of the vote to 49 . 5 for Sanders .Taking the stage to address supporters in Des Moines even though the race hadn t been called , Clinton pressed her argument that she is the most qualified candidate to continue President Obama s legacy .I am a progressive who gets things done for people , she said . I am honored to stand in a long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough , that standing still is not an option .When it is all said and done , we have to be united against a Republican vision and candidates who would drive us apart and divide us , she added .Sanders took the stage to raucous supporters a few minutes later .Tonight while the results are still not known , it looks like we are in a virtual tie , Sanders said . The people of Iowa have sent a profound message to the political establishment .The results quickly narrowed the race on both sides . Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , the 2008 Iowa caucus winner who never contended seriously this time , dropped out before Cruz was declared the victor .I am officially suspending my campaign , he said on Twitter . Thank you for all your loyal support .And former Maryland Governor Martin O Malley , whose Democratic campaign had been mired in single digits and did not gain any traction in Iowa , suspended his campaign in an email to supporters .Late polling over the weekend and on Monday had showed Trump leading Cruz in the Republican race , while Clinton and Sanders were locked in a close fight .? With additional reporting by Tessa Berenson Urbandale , Iowa Philip Elliott West Des Moines and Sam Frizell Des Moines 	 0
According to Goldberg ' s son in law , Rob Dubbin , Goldberg passed away at his Montecito , California , home on June 22 , just three days shy of what would ' ve been his 69th birthday . The cause was a brain tumor .Goldberg , a Brooklyn native , collected seven Emmy nominations over the course of his career and won two of them . He picked up an outstanding drama series Emmy in 1979 for CBS ' " Lou Grant , " and an outstanding writing in a comedy series Emmy for " Family Ties " in 1987 .Goldberg contributed to " M A S H , " " The Tony Randall Show " and " The Bob Newhart Show " during the ' 70s before taking inspiration from his life and the lives of his friends to create " Family Ties . "The NBC sitcom , which became a defining series for the network during its seven season run from 1982 to 1989 , centered on the cultural differences between a pair of liberal parents ( Meredith Baxter and Michael Gross as Elyse and Steven Keaton ) and their more conservative kids who were coming of age during the Reagan administration .A young Michael J . Fox had a breakout role as the Keatons ' son , Alex . Justine Bateman and Tina Yothers played his sisters , Mallory and Jennifer , while Brian Bonsall later joined the series as younger brother Andy .Goldberg teamed up again with Fox in 1996 for the comedy " Spin City , " which Goldberg co created with Bill Lawrence .Fox , now 52 , said in a statement that it is with a " full heart " that he says " goodbye to my mentor , benefactor , partner , second father and beloved friend , Gary David Goldberg . He touched so many with his enormous talent and generous spirit . He changed my life profoundly . Love to his wife Diana and all of Gary ' s family .

My thoughts and prayers are with Gary David Goldberg ' s family , " she tweeted Monday . " A wonderful man who taught me so much . "Charlie Sheen , who worked with Goldberg on " Spin City , " echoed that gratitude in his tweet , calling Goldberg his " sitcom mentor " and a " genius .

He wrote the screenplays for 1989 ' s " Dad , " 1995 ' s " Bye Bye Love " and 2005 ' s " Must Love Dogs , " all of which he also produced .People we lost in 2013 : The lives they lived 	 0
Giraffes are a common sight in Kruger National Park .KRUGER NATIONAL PARK , South Africa I spent two nights sleeping under a full moon sky , nestled in my trusty hammock at Kruger National Park . Our guides provided us with tents , but I figured I wouldn ' t have too many opportunities in my life to slumber in the open bush on the African continent .Thus , I rested more or less exposed throughout the night , hoping that a lion wouldn ' t figure that he wouldn ' t have too many opportunities in his life to maul a sleeping American tourist in the open bush on the African continent .Needless to say , I survived , and it was magnificent . Visually speaking , I wasn ' t sure what , exactly , to expect from a South African safari , for my complete mental database of safari images spanned a wide variety of distinct landscapes , and most were cartoonishly obstructed by rich , middle aged tourists covered head to toe in unnecessary beige safari gear .However , Kruger National Park seemed to fit , quite perfectly , my idea of the African savannah . Arid and brown from the winter dry season , it was a forever long expanse of low trees and dusty earth , the kind that somehow allows the early sun to reflect that perfect glow of stunning reds and oranges .Our guide was a self proclaimed African bushman named Elson , who seemed to have an amazing one ness with both the land and the animals . We ' d be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace , only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep , slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away . It would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance .He knew the land , and he knew the animals a talent that proved helpful for finding the less common residents in the savannah . The other creatures carelessly came into view as though the roads and cars were just a natural part of their habitat , a mild annoyance at worst . iReport . com : Share your South Africa experiences and suggestionsKruger National Park is roughly the same size as Israel , and here , many animals roamed right along the roadside , gnawing on whatever vegetation remained until the rainy season would flourish the plants anew . Seemingly endless miles of terrain , and there they were just feet away from us .If you didn ' t know you were in a national park , you might think you were in a zoo . That ' s how close the animals came to our jeep . Only , here , they weren ' t in separate enclosures , wandering aimlessly within an artificial terrain . This was truly their home , and we were only passing guests .Giraffes tore away at high branches . Elephants walked fearlessly , one by one across the road . Rhinos . . . well , the rhinos pretty much just sat there looking stupid . But the zebras frolicked . The hippos splashed in the water . And the baboons stopped at nothing to make me laugh .Of course , the rare lions and leopards pretty much just shaded themselves under distant trees , and the crocs swam silently through the bog . But they were there . And we were there . And it was beautiful .And just as soon as it began , our time in the South African bush was over . A couple of giraffes and elephants met us by the roadside to bid our group farewell as we drove out of the park .The preserve faded silently behind us , and the road ahead paved my way to Swaziland for a short stopover before continuing to the second part of this South African journey . 	 0
Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch will read a specially written poem at the " funeral " of Richard III , the King found buried beneath a parking lot his own distant relative .Oscar nominated Cumberbatch , who is to star as Richard III in an upcoming TV adaptation , will read a verse penned for the service by Britain ' s poet laureate , Carol Ann Duffy .The 14 line verse , titled simply " Richard , " will remain a closely guarded secret until the service of reinterment at Leicester Cathedral on Thursday .All the organizers will say is that it is a " meditation on the impact of Richard ' s finding and on the legacy of his story . "They also have revealed that it contains the phrase " grant me the carving of my name , " recognizing that Richard III ' s grave was lost for centuries , with no tombstone to mark its location .In a statement , Duffy said it was " a privilege to be involved , in a small way " in the farewell to Richard , the last English King to die in battle , 530 years ago .Cumberbatch ' s reading will form part of a service of reinterment for the medieval monarch , which will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Justin Welby .Key figures in the rediscovery and identification of the royal remains , including historians , archaeologists , scientists and relatives are expected to attend , along with members of the public who won a ballot for tickets .Queen Elizabeth II has written a message to be included in the order of service for the event , at which she will be represented by the Countess of Wessex .On Sunday , tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Leicester and its surrounding villages as Richard III ' s coffin was carried out to the site of the Battle of Bosworth , where he was killed in 1485 , and back in a procession .Since then , people have queued around the block to see it lying " in repose " in the cathedral where it will be reinterred in a tomb made of pale Swaledale fossil limestone from Yorkshire , set on a plinth of black Kilkenny marble .Richard III ' s remains were found in August 2012 by archaeologists searching for the remains of the Greyfriars Monastery , which had been covered over by a council car park .The skeleton has been studied at the University of Leicester ever since , allowing scientists to discover a host of details about Richard III ' s life and death by analyzing the bones .The university ' s genealogy expert , Kevin Shurer , has discovered that Cumberbatch is related to Richard III ." Benedict is Richard III ' s second cousin , 16 removed , " Shurer explained . " He is linked in several ways , but . . . the shortest is via Richard ' s mother , Cecily Neville ' s grandmother , Joan Beaufort . He also has more indirect links to both Queen Elizabeth II and Lady Jane Grey through other ancestors in his family tree ." It is great that Benedict has the opportunity to take part in the ceremony . . . having him there will add another dimension to what has already been a momentous week . "Shurer also helped confirm the link between the last Plantagenet King and living relatives Michael Ibsen and Wendy Duldig , whose DNA proved the identity of Richard III ' s remains .Ibsen , a Canadian born cabinetmaker who now lives in London , built the English oak and yew coffin in which Richard III will be buried .Five things we ' ve learned about Richard III from his remainsRichard III the mystery of the King and the car parking lot 	 0

Chatham , Ma Woods Hole Oceanographic News In a final lifting of his middle finger to the constituents that paid his way for over 55 years , deceased Senator Edward M . Kennedy had one parting shot to ruin labor day for millions on Cape Cod .Reports that the Senator had requested he be buried at sea , apparently have leaked out to the marine world as a pod of great white sharks have suddenly appeared off Cape Cods most popular beaches during labor day , effectively causing Massachusetts authorities to ban swimming , wading , paddle boarding , or even diving in to take a pee .Meanwhile herds of young seals , seeming oblivious to the surrounding cruising predators , some eye witnesses said they were as big ' as a Oldsmobile 88 ' , continued to frolic and delight shore bound tourists .Said Chatham police chief Earl Scheider , " you can ' t fool these big guys , they ' re going to skip the appetizers and go right for the main course ! "Biologists are perplexed over the white shark arrival . " Usually they don ' t even cruise around here , and certainly not in this close to the beach , " said Tammy Peirce , a shark expert from Woods Hole . " It must have something to do with the full moon , the extraordinary tides , and all the recent coverage over the Senator ' s death . Good news travels fast up here in the Northeast ! "Meanwhile enterprising vendors were doing a brisk business selling hastily printed T shirts with Kennedy ' s likeness and the caption : " DON ' T BITE ME BRO ! " as he swam to shore surrounded by shark fins and the Chappaquiddick bridge in the background .As one grizzled Cape Cod clammer said in summation , " Hey , man , sometimes shit happens ! One day you eat the shark , the next the shark eats you . It ' s the American way , you know ! " 	 1
Today ' s Supreme Court decision , that money ( as with " money speaks " ) is entitled to first amendment protection and the rights of personhood , has again been hailed with the word " freeeedomm ! " on conservative twitter sites .This new " money speaks " decision also indicates far ranging possibilities for whistleblowers if employed by a corporation with whistleblowing as product .To review , the new decision , led by Justices John " Smilin ' Jack " Roberts and Clarence " The Card " Thomas , means no limits whatever on campaign contributions .Also , private ownership of political parties is now legal .The Republican Party has immediately put a price tag on itself . It will become a corporation with the flagship mission to " be the leader of corporate America and do its bidding full time , instead of just part time . "The new name " The Grand Old Company Inc . " is being considered ( GOC vs . GOP ) .Democrats are reported confused , with the President undecided whether to go ahead to incorporate ( a new name , " The Don Key Holy Company Inc . " is under study ) , or leave it to Hillary Clinton to make the decision in 2016 .As to how much it would cost to purchase one or both parties , a representative for Speaker Boehner has replied , " Reasonable . Of course , representatives of The Company need to be paid . "Analysts at The New York Times and CNN are predicting outright purchase of either party ( or both ) is well within reach of the nation ' s wealthiest billionaires .Further , Justice Thomas is reported fully engaged in a follow up project on first amendment rights of the Supreme Court . That is , whether it , too , can become a company to be purchased .Its possible title " Supreme Decisions Inc . " has drawn snorts from Justice Ginsburg . She has taken a dim view of all these developments , as with this remark :" The first amendment does not guarantee the right for anyone to allow his dog , or himself , to defecate on somebody else ' s private lawn . No matter how rich that person , or his dog , happens to be . "An unexpected consequence of this new decision is that certain wealthy citizens ( as with Mr Pierre Omidyar , owner of The Intercept First Look Media ) on seeing how much attention various whistleblowers are getting have ventured toward privatizing whistleblowing .That is , a whistleblower corporation ( versus an individual acting alone ) might utilize employees such as Edward Snowden who blow the whistle on important classified materials related to the military and security establishments .Under the current " money speaks " SCOTUS decision , would such individuals , in contrast to their situation now ( Snowden is under grand jury indictment ) be free to speak at will ( and get paid ) ?Justice Thomas ' s office reasons that , with the Hobby Lobby decision and the Citizens United cases as precedents , the answer is affirmative .This means a whistleblower corporation ( Mr Omidyar is rumored to be considering " The School Pigeon Inc . " as title ) would qualify under " money speaks " and have first amendment rights to whatever it wanted to express .Whether Mr Snowden and Mr Assange would consent to become employees ( at a hefty annual salary ) remains to be seen . 	 1

She asked Grant what he enjoyed the most about working with Sarah Jessica Parker on their latest movie Did You Hear About The Morgans ?" Her breast . " He replied . He caught himself and said that he was sorry that he meant to say her zest .Susanna turned a light pink and then asked Hugh if he felt that her bosom was distracting him .Grant replied that her butterbags were not distracting him in the least and he replied that his favorite all time movie was Cleopatra .Susanna looked puzzled and told him that she had not asked him that question but that it was certainly a good answer .Hugh asked Susanna what she had asked him . She replied that she had not asked him anything .He turned away and then replied that he was born in Hammersmith , England . Susanna replied that she had not asked him that , but thanked him for the information .Grant told her that she was welcome and then said that his favorite number was the number two as in two tits . He caught himself and said that he meant to say three as in the children ' s nursery rhyme 1 , 2 , 3 , I see your bumpies .Susanna shook her head and she thanked Grant for coming . " I did " he asked surprisingly .In other news . The Republic of Mexico hurting for tourism due to the on going drug cartel wars has placed adds in twenty of the top newspapers in England .

MONTCLAIR , NJ 27 year old LeeAnne Copeland ' s decision to consume an entire box of Valentine ' s chocolates over the course of five days led her boyfriend of 10 months to end their relationship Monday .Michael Kristoff , 27 , a part time bartender , gave Copeland a two pound , red satin lined box of Russell Stover premium assorted chocolates on Valentine ' s Day . According to Kristoff , Copeland " really packed on the pounds " in the days that followed ." It was noticeable , " Kristoff said , describing a bulge on Copeland ' s midriff . " She seemed completely unaware of what she was doing to herself physically , and I found that very disconcerting . "The weight gain , which Kristoff estimated to be between three and five pounds , transformed the young woman into " kind of a porker , " according to Kristoff ." Before the candy , LeeAnne was an active person , " Kristoff said . " She was always hopping around , straightening up her apartment , going to the gym . "However , the chocolate , coupled with a snowstorm that shut down much of the Northeast , " gave Copeland an all too convenient excuse " to spend a week watching DVDs and eating chocolate ." For the next couple nights , when I ' d come over I ' d notice her stealing into the candy box , cramming her face , " Kristoff said . " She even made a joke about it , telling me that she could see why they put Valentine ' s Day in February , when it was cold and snowy and there wasn ' t much else to do but eat . Like it was all a big joke to her . "Kristoff said he was repulsed by the sight of Copeland eating ." I ' d seen her eat before , but it was nothing like this , " Kristoff said . " You could see chocolate dotting her teeth and tiny strings of saliva between her lips and traces of nougat and coconut on the corners of her mouth . "Kristoff added : " It made me sick . "Copeland initially refused to eat the chocolate , according to Kristoff ." She was all , ' Oh , no , no , I can ' t eat all these , they ' re way too fattening , ' " said Kristoff , impersonating Copeland . " She was trying to get me to eat most of the box , and was really stubborn about it . "" It ' s kind of ironic , considering how this has all panned out , " Kristoff added .Kristoff said that as he watched Copeland take her first , tentative bite of a strawberry cream , he had " this out of nowhere premonition . "" It struck me that the chocolate eating could be a foreshadowing of things to come , " Kristoff said . " If I took her out to a steak place for her birthday , would she finish her whole meal ? And what about holidays like Thanksgiving ? When I got to thinking about the wedding cake , that ' s when the alarm bells really went off . "Despite these strong reservations , Kristoff said he " remained in deep denial for several days . "" I tried to make it work , " Kristoff said . " I tried to tell myself that maybe the old LeeAnne would come back once the chocolates were gone , but I didn ' t think I could wait it out . "Kristoff severed ties via a brief e mail .Copeland said the sudden breakup had left her devastated , confused , and " so depressed I can ' t eat . "Reached for comment , Kristoff said : " It ' s too bad she didn ' t display a little bit of that self discipline earlier . . . We might still be together today . " 	 1

SAN FRANCISCO Traveling from as far away as park benches on the other side of town , hundreds of rabid temporary housing enthusiasts lined up overnight Friday in hopes of being among the first admitted to the city ' s newest homeless shelter ." I got here around 3 a . m . , and already there was a crowd of people slumped over out front , " said Jerome Ashford , a die hard fan of having a roof over his head . " I had a feeling it was going to be popular , but this turnout it ' s just insane . If I can ' t get in tonight , I don ' t know what I ' ll do . "Since last Tuesday , men and women of all ages have left the familiar comforts of air conditioned bus stations and ATM lobbies to brave the elements outside the much anticipated Mission District shelter . While most arrive with nothing more than three partially smoked cigarettes and a slice of bologna wrapped in a handkerchief , others have come fully prepared for the long wait with shopping carts full of supplies ." I haven ' t been this excited since the bakery down the street threw out an entire trash bag of bagels , " said Lawrence Jones , who took the week off from collecting aluminum cans and selling his plasma to a nearby blood bank to wait outside the shelter . " Sure , I haven ' t showered in a public fountain in days , and I miss the warmth of my alleyway back home , but in the end , it ' ll all be worth it . "Although the prospect of sleeping outdoors for nothing more than the most basic of human necessities might seem extreme to some , many in attendance say they ' ve been looking forward to the shelter ' s grand opening since first reading about it beneath a blanket of newspapers ." I started begging for subway fare the moment I heard the news , " said Wendy Slovic , 41 , adding that there was " no way " she could wait a couple of weeks for the crowds to thin out . " Say whatever you want , but I wouldn ' t trade my place in line for all the scratch tickets in the world . "For some , the anticipation of lying on a cot or having three meals a day is so great that blacking out at night has become an almost impossible task . Still many others , who have been eagerly counting down the days since fishing an old wall calendar from a dumpster , can hardly put their growing elation into words ." Where is my soul , they took my soul away , " said Michael " Bone " Zahn , who for the last week hasn ' t left his place at the front of the line even to use the restroom . " Broken windows like spiderwebs , a stone on a rocking chair , rain rain rain rain begone , you cloth demons ! "Among the clamoring mass of refuge fanatics , the most devoted arrived early Sunday morning in full costume , including old shopping bags that had been fashioned into makeshift footwear and heavy ash colored makeup covering their faces and hands . Some even carried a variety of creative signs with them ." Back when I started lining up to get into shelters , there were only 10 or 15 of us at most , " said Samuel Robins , 63 , gesturing at the teeming crowd of shelter enthusiasts on hand . " To see how far things have come in the last decade alone . It ' s unbelievable really . "" Many of the kids here today weren ' t even alive when the first shelter was built on this street , " Robins added .Despite the growing excitement , a number of mega fans who have spent the last week sleeping in front of the shelter , and the week before that sleeping behind the shelter , said they are trying to keep their already high expectations in check ." I know it probably won ' t live up to the picture I have in my head , but it ' s still hard not to get your hopes up , " harmonica musician Johnnie Brooklyn , 39 , said . " You want it to be amazing for there to be hot food on hand , maybe even hot water but at the same time , you have to be realistic about these sorts of things . "" Man , hot water would be nice , though , " Brooklyn added .While the mob scene in front of the shelter has caused a few minor disruptions , including one incident in which a passerby was asked for spare change 143 consecutive times , only a handful of residents have reacted negatively to the swelling crowds ." To be honest , I feel sorry for them , " said Beverly Sherman , an administrative coordinator for Wells Fargo Bank . " To have so little in your life that you think nothing of camping out on the streets for days on end it ' s depressing . "Added Sherman : " Seriously , these people need help . " 	 1
Murrieta , CA Federal officials , members of the mainstream media , and the self appointed PC Police are imploring citizens to stop using what they consider to be offensive language regarding the influx of immigrants from Central America into Texas .The self righteous among us are saddened when they hear words like " aliens " and " illegal immigrants . " They prefer words that will solicit sympathy from the public like " refugees . "However , " refugees " is not testing well in focus groups so the guilty liberals are searching for a new term to make them feel better about themselves .The latest term for those causing the newest invasion into our country is " Mosquitos . "Terry Parsons , a member of DHS , told us , " These people are swarming our border , spreading diseases , nobody wants them , and they ' re here to suck the lifeblood out of our economy . It seems to be a good term that fits . "Terry obviously doesn ' t listen to the words that come out of his mouth and it is just a matter of a few weeks before others on his side figure out this latest term is derogatory and offensive as well to those trying to infect our nation .May we suggest to Terry and those like him the terms " parasites " , " Texas ticks " , or " leeches ? " These terms seem to fit pretty well too .While the current infestation grows , the elitists worry more about what to call something than how to fix the problem .We all know the fastest way to solve this problem is to build the Great Wall of America as a way to keep unwanted pests out but , as usual , the government can never do things the easy way .For now , their strategy appears to be to disperse the misery throughout the land and try to get as many " Mosquitos " as they can to vote Democrat on Election Day . 	 1

Scientists say they have found 50 galaxies that may contain intelligent alien races .These galaxies were found to be emitting ' unusually high ' levels of radiation possibly indicating ' the presence of a highly advanced civilisation . 'Within these galaxies , the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing the power of the stars emitting huge amounts of noticeable heat in the process .Pennsylvania scientists have found evidence that we may not be alone . They found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation . This could be because aliens are harnessing the power of stars . However , further research is needed to confirm that is the case . Shown is Arp 220 , one promising galaxy candidateThe study was led by Dr Jason Wright from the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University in Pennsylvania .The Glimpsing Heat from Alien Technologies Survey ( G Hat ) , published in the Astrophysical Journal , details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours .A proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a Dyson sphere .First proposed by theoretical physicist freeman Dyson in 1960 , this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star .They could be an enclosed shell , or spacecraft spread out to gather its energy known as a Dyson swarm .If such structures do exist , they would emit huge amounts of noticeable infrared radiation back on Earth .But as of yet , such a structure has not been detected .Source : All About Space magazine' The idea behind our research is that , if an entire galaxy had been colonised by an advanced spacefaring civilisation , the energy produced by that civilisation ' s technologies would be detectable in mid infrared wavelengths , ' said Dr Wright .The energy used by such a race to be noticeable would have to be huge likely harnessing the power of a galaxy ' s stars .But Dr Wright said that ' fundamental thermodynamics tells us that this energy must be radiated away as heat in the mid infrared wavelengths ' .This would make them noticeable to Nasa ' s Wise telescope , used in the study .The researchers picked out 100 , 000 galaxies of interest , and found that 50 of them were emitting ' unusually high levels of mid infrared radiation . '' Our follow up studies of those galaxies may reveal if the origin of their radiation results from natural astronomical processes , or if it could indicate the presence of a highly advanced civilization , ' said Dr Wright .A proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a Dyson sphere ( artist ' s impression shown ) . First proposed by theoretical physicist freeman Dyson in 1960 , this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star to gather its energyThe findings were made using Nasa ' s orbiting Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( Wise ) telescope ( artist ' s illustration shown ) . This telescope is perfect for detecting mid infrared radiation that an advanced alien race might be emittingHowever , talking to MailOnline , Dr Wright noted that the findings were not a sure fire sign of alien life . The observations could simply be due to natural phenomena , such as dust and star formation .He said , including the 50 galaxies , none of the 100 , 000 were found ' with more than 85 per cent of their light being used by alien industry . 'However , it ' s possible that some galaxies do harbour advanced alien life but they are emitting less energy than we can currently detect .' The harder we look and the longer we work , the better our detection limit will be , and the less energy a galaxy spanning civilization would need to use for us to discover it , ' he added .Another possibility , of course , is that such civilisations simply don ' t exist .But Dr Wright and his colleagues will be hoping that is not the case and they are continuing to study galaxies for signs that we are not alone .The Glimpsing Heat from Alien Technologies Survey ( G Hat ) , published in the Astrophysical Journal , details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours . None have been confirmed yet but the signs so far could be considered promising 	 0
new delhi, india britain's prime minister delivered a sober message wednesday to pakistan : don't export terror. " we want to see a strong and a stable and a democratic pakistan, " david cameron said in bangalore, india, " but we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way to promote the export of terror, whether to india or whether to afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world. " cameron made several remarks in a speech and a question and answer session. a transcript of his comments were posted on the prime minister's website. " the relationship is important, but it should be a relationship based on a very clear message that it is not right... to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror. democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that, and the message to pakistan from the u. s. and from the u. k. is very clear on that point, " he said. his remarks come as the military documents divulged by wikileaks include indications that pakistan's spy service, the directorate of inter services intelligence, or the isi, may have been helping militants in afghanistan, an assertion strongly disputed by pakistani officials. the united states has been working to help bolster the pakistani government's efforts to battle taliban and al qaeda elements in the country. the nato led command has been focused on insurgents operating along the afghan and pakistani border, and india has long been concerned about militancy in india that comes from pakistan. he also said that india and britain must work closer on security, saying " the terrorists we face are adept at crossing borders, communicating globally, and concocting the most abhorrent plans to destroy our way of life. " " five years ago, 52 people were killed on the tube and on a bus in london. and in november 2008, we watched in horror as terrorists went on the rampage in mumbai, killing scores of indians and three british nationals. as you know, we worked with your government in the investigation into these events, " cameron said. " we remain determined that those responsible must be brought to justice. " he said that when it comes to protecting their mutual citizenry, developments in afghanistan and pakistan can't be " overlooked. " " let me state clearly : your relations with those two countries are a matter for you and you alone. but let me also say we, like you, want a pakistan that is stable, democratic and free from terror. we, like you, want an afghanistan that is secure, free from interference from its neighbors and not a threat to our security. we, like you, are determined that groups like the taliban, the haqqani network or lashkar e tayyiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on indian and british citizens in india or in britain. neither should they be able to do so against our people, whether soldiers or civilians, from both our countries who are working for peace in afghanistan. our interests are your interests, so let us work together to realize them. " when asked about cameron's remarks, a spokesman for pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said britain and pakistan " have a robust and comprehensive partnership, including on counter terrorism. " " terrorists have no religion, no humanity, no specific ethnicity or geography. terrorists'networks, as the u. k. knows full well mutate and operate in different regions and cities. the genesis of terrorism as a global phenomenon warrants close attention. pakistan is as much a victim of terrorism as are afghanistan, india or other countries, " the statement said. " pakistan has done much more than any other country in combating terrorism. our people and security forces have rendered innumerable sacrifices. we hope that our friends will be able to persuade india to view this issue objectively and the value of'cooperation'in counter terrorism. " pakistan has a troubled history with india, and in the past india has accused the isi of supporting militant separatists in indian administered kashmir. pakistan and afghanistan also have a tumultuous past. during the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in pakistan helped train fighters who battled the soviets. after the taliban took over afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. it dropped its support after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on washington and new york. lashkar e tayyiba, which means " army of the pure, " was blamed for the november 2008 mumbai attack in which nearly 200 people were killed over three days. the man regarded as the group's leader says it wasn't involved in the act despite evidence to the contrary. experts say that group claims it is focused on the same issue as it was when created : freeing the disputed territory of kashmir from indian rule a dispute that has been the source of great 	 0
u. s. special ops troops head to syria : will it be enough? fewer than 50 special operations forces will help sunni rebelscommandos won't be take on a combat mission, white house saysthe obama administration is deploying several dozen special operations forces inside syria? for the first time in a significant escalation of the fight against the radical islamic state group. fewer than 50 u. s. military personnel will be based in northeast syria to work with sunni arab and kurdish forces, according to a u. s. defense official. their mission is to train and assist the local fighters battling islamic state, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss details of the deployment. a second defense official told reporters at the pentagon that the commandos will arrive in syria within a month and stay for weeks or months, not permanently. at the same time, the u. s. is bolstering forces stationed at incirlik air base in turkey, adding a 10 ground attack planes and f 15 fighters for the air campaign against islamic state, the officials said. while the white house insisted the deployment to syria wasn t a change in strategy, it represents a departure from president barack obama s previous assurances that the u. s. wouldn t commit u. s. troops to ground combat against islamic state. these forces don't have a combat mission, white house press secretary josh earnest said friday, although he acknowledged they re going to be taking risks in a dangerous part of the world. he said that the deployment won t fundamentally shift the balance on the battlefield. he also wouldn t rule out a further escalation. there is no military solution to the problems plaguing iraq and syria, he said. the new action represents an escalation of the u. s. fight against the terrorist group in syria, where russia has begun its own air campaign against rebels fighting the regime of president bashar al assad. u. s. officials have complained that the russians have largely targeted moderate rebel forces instead of islamic state. the white house described the risk that u. s. personnel could come under attack during russian military efforts in syria as minimal, but didn t unequivocally rule out the possibility. obama has repeatedly said that local forces must lead the fight against islamic state, with training and assistance from the u. s. in a speech to the nation on sept. 10, 2014, obama said the fight against islamic state will not involve american combat troops fighting on foreign soil. the special operations forces in syria will coordinate with local ground forces as the u. s. led coalition continues attacking islamic state from the air in syria and in neighboring iraq. americans already working as advisers to iraqi troops. the new contingent in syria will assess how to improve the rebels ability to call in allied airstrikes and whether the forces are trustworthy enough to be supplied with small arms by the u. s., according to the defense official who briefed reporters. the u. s. commandos won t call in airstrikes themselves and won t participate in raids against islamic state targets, the official said. the u. s. will also seek to establish a special operations task force with the iraqi government and increase assistance to jordan and lebanon to fight islamic state, the other defense official said. as the expanded military effort was being announced at the white house, secretary of state john kerry was briefing reporters in vienna at the end oftwo days of talks aimed at finding a diplomatic solution for the civil war in syria. we are intensifying our counter daesh campaign and we are intensifying our diplomatic efforts in order to end the conflict, and we believe these steps are mutually reinforcing, kerry said, employing an arabic acronym for islamic state. syria s war : a guide to who wants whatparticipants in the vienna talks, including assad s allies russia and iran, agreed to meet again within two weeks and set out principles including that any solution must maintain syria s unity, territorial integrity and state institutions. the group also called for the united nations to convene talks with the syrian government and opposition on a political process that could lead to a cease fire. while kerry said the u. s. and its allies haven t changed their position that assad must go, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said there s no agreement on the syrian president s future. some congressional republicans, who have been critical of obama s approach to battling islamic state, said the administration still hasn t come up with a coherent plan in the region. house majority leader kevin mccarthy, a california republican, called the deployment yet another tactical move in the absence of a comprehensive strategy for iraq, syria, and the broader middle east. the u. s. fight against islamic state has been hampered in both syria and iraq by the absence of sufficient ground forces capable of seizing and holding significant territory with the support of coalition combat air, said fred hof, a former state department adviser 	 0
Autumn Statement : George Osborne has declared war on second home ownersIt s politically astute but wholly unfair for George Osborne to target those who invest in propertyPrice : From ? 390 , 000 Agent : Harriss Property The Beach Houses in Margate by Harriss Property provide panoramic views onto the Sandy Beach of Westbrook Bay from the private terraces and floor to ceiling windows ? Photo : Harriss PropertyWhat a bonanza for local tradesmen . Even once they re done up , these places need to have the stucco painted , and there s always a cellar to be tanked or woodburning stove to put in . This summer , part of our garden disappeared when the capping of an old well fell in . We ve had to get that sorted too ." Philosophically , Conservatives believe that individuals should be free to do what they like with their own money "The revival of this depressed corner of England is long overdue , but now it s happening : almost entirely because of the money injected by people from affluent London , often second home owners . So obviously , we re evil . At least this is the message I take from the Chancellor s Autumn Statement , which whacks an extra 3 per cent stamp duty on people who are buying an additional property .Not that it s only the Aslets who are in George Osborne s sights . He also wants to deter buy to let landlords ? the type who ve been building up useful portfolios of rental properties , often to provide an income during retirement in a world where interest earned on savings is next to nothing .I don t complain . To own two homes , however modest , when many young people can t afford one , may well seem selfish . And we live in an increasingly unequal age , when bashing people with more of life s bounty than ourselves is par for the course .I myself am a strong advocate of making motorists pay through the nose ( I don t have a car ) . On this measure , Mr Osborne s stamp duty hike is politically astute . It seems to be doing something for people who haven t managed to get a foot on the housing ladder by bashing fat cats . In fact , it s illogical and wrong .Philosophically , Conservatives believe that individuals should be free to do what they like with their own money . If they re crazy enough to want two properties ? and there is an element of craziness in some cases , ours in particular ? is it for the Government to stop them ?The problem that the Chancellor should really be addressing is the chronic under supply of housing in this country . Ever since the Eighties , when Margaret Thatcher wound up the Milton Keynes Development Corporation and entrusted Britain s housing needs to the free market , politicians have ducked the issue of where all the new houses that we need should be built . It s too difficult , too long term .Mr Osborne is , I m afraid , as bad as the rest . The truth is that second homes are a sideshow . They re the wrong sort of houses for first time buyers , in the wrong places . The real problem is that the market ? particularly in the South East ? has moved beyond the buying power of many people s wages .Stamp duty should , if anything , be reduced , to encourage more people to sell . At present , as well as having too few homes for our population , too few homes are changing hands ? from the top of the ladder to the very bottom . Obstacles to the efficient operation of the market , such as stamp duty , aren t helpful .Because of these appallingly high property prices , most young people need to rent . This is a generational change . Buying used to be the middle class norm but that s over ? and for the Chancellor to pretend that those days will return is either deluded or cynical .And remember sub prime ? Encouraging people who couldn t afford a mortgage to take one out started the biggest financial meltdown of a lifetime . Yet that is exactly what the Government may be doing by helping first timers to buy at today s astronomical prices . Who s to say that we aren t in a bubble ?" Without somewhere outside the capital the family would have gone mad "People have forgotten the horrors of the early Nineties , when many families were compelled by negative equity to stay in homes ? even relationships ? from which they wished to escape . At the very least , mortgages on the sort of multiple of salary needed today will condemn some borrowers to a lifetime of misery , as they struggle to pay down the debt . And from the Treasury s perspective , that money would surely be better spent elsewhere .It would be far better to live as they do on the Continent , in smaller cities where those inside are within easy reach of countryside , and those outside can easily get in . As it is , we re stuck with a megalopolis . The Chancellor has no answer to that . 	 0
ANKENY , IA In a turn of events local grief counselor Maggie Hedrick described Tuesday as " typical " and " her life in a nutshell , " the 32 year old ' s first date since entering her 30s ended abruptly Sunday when the lifeless body of Washburn High School sophomore David Schiller was found in nearby Big Creek Lake .Schiller , who could literally have chosen any other day in the last two years to achieve a reported blood alcohol level of . 22 , fall out of his canoe , and ingest three gallons of water , opted to drown on the one evening Hedrick had plans to meet and have dinner with an actual single male ." Why is it no one ever jumps off a building or dies in a car crash when I ' m stuck playing solitaire at home ? " Hedrick said . " I pulled weeds from my garden all day Saturday . Where were all the drownings of teenaged boys with their whole lives still ahead of them then ? "While Hedrick acknowledged that no one is ever prepared for a tragic loss of the magnitude of Schiller ' s death , she said she should have nonetheless seen it coming , given her personal luck . " Helping family members through the grieving process is never easy , " Hedrick said . " But it ' s especially heartbreaking when you have to ditch a handsome guy who also happens to like early 20th century architecture . "Emergency rescue teams , working with what Hedrick called " speed and efficiency on a level I ' d never before seen from them , of course , " recovered Schiller ' s body less than 40 minutes after Hedrick and substitute teacher Jeff Lindenbaum , 30 , met for dinner at a local seafood restaurant . Approximately 15 minutes later , Hedrick received a call from Ankeny police summoning her to the scene of the accident , as if her immediate presence would somehow bring Schiller ' s bloated , waterlogged corpse back to life .A report issued Monday by the Polk County Coroner ' s Office put Schiller ' s time of death somewhere between the moment Lindenbaum arrived at Hedrick ' s residence with a bouquet of fresh flowers at 6 : 34 p . m . and the very instant both realized that the other also had wishes to someday raise a family at 6 : 58 p . m ." I don ' t want to sound insensitive , but David ' s parents will have the rest of their lives to mourn the death of their only son , " said Hedrick , who claimed to have a " pretty good idea " how Howard and Janet Schiller felt when they heard the news . " Initial denial of a tragedy is a natural and understandable human impulse . What ' s another two or three hours , in the grand scheme of things ? "" Don ' t get me wrong , it would ' ve been a whole different situation had the date been going badly . In fact , I would have probably welcomed Schiller ' s death if that had been the case , " Hedrick added . " But Jeff and I were really hitting it off . "Although Lindenbaum left a message on Hedrick ' s voice mail late Sunday night , he has not called again since , leading Hedrick to fear that a rare opportunity for a serious relationship may have been " totally blown . "" David ' s death has affected not only those who knew him , but also those who had never even met him , " Hedrick said . " Not even once . "" I don ' t know exactly how Howard and Janet are handling this , as I ' ve been too busy wondering if Jeff will ever call me again to actually pay attention , but I imagine they must feel responsible on some level , " continued Hedrick . " While it ' s just a hypothesis , there ' s a possibility that if both parents had paid more attention to their son , I would be getting laid right now . "" What a tragic waste of a night , " she added . 	 1

GREENFIELD , OH A local teenager , standing on the corner of Spring Street and Dunlap Lane , is clearly up to some kind of no good , neighborhood sources reported Thursday .The teenager , spotted by Greenfield residents at approximately 4 : 36 p . m . , has been described as tall , suspiciously quiet , and almost certainly looking for trouble . According to concerned sources , the teenager has absolutely no business being out there like that ." Just look at him , " said Bob Page , one of several men and women currently watching the 14 year old from their living room window . " That boy ' s definitely up to something . "Signs that the teenager may be up to no good have so far included his hunched over posture , the way he keeps looking around with his eyes , and the fact that he probably owns a number of those violent video games .Residents told reporters that they are especially troubled by the teenager ' s hooded sweatshirt , which he is wearing with the hood drawn , despite it not even raining outside ." I don ' t like how I can ' t see his face , " said homemaker Ellen Campbell , who attributed the teen ' s erratic behavior to the lack of positive role models in today ' s music industry . " He ' d show his face if he weren ' t thinking of doing something wrong . I bet he ' s thinking of doing something wrong right now . "Based on his outward appearance , many are worried that the teenager is one of those youths who were recently caught drinking in the woods behind the recycling center .According to residents , what the teenager will do next remains their chief concern . Though he is not currently in possession of a shopping cart , residents believe that he may in fact steal one from the nearby Stop Shop , simply for the sake of inconveniencing others . Some have even speculated that the teenager may be planning to burn dead leaves later this afternoon , possibly with the cigarette lighter to which he no doubt has access .Whatever unlawful acts he may be planning , locals are convinced it will include some sort of profanity , whether spoken , written , or a combination of both ." He ' s probably waiting for one of his friends to arrive , " said Howard Silverman , who pretended to check on his mailbox four separate times in order to get a better look at the teen . " Once that happens , they ' ll come up with something really terrible to do together . "Added Silverman , " The songs they listen to make them angry . "Fears among residents increased minutes later when several onlookers noticed that the teenager ' s hands had entered his pockets . Among the items believed to be inside his pockets were spray cans , spoiled eggs , and probably one of those miniature stereos that all the young people own .The teenager then removed a cell phone from his pocket , viewed its screen which sources believe contained a nude picture of another teenager and placed it back in his pocket ." What ' s he hiding ? " homeowner Ron Kirkland asked . " One thing I know for sure : He ' s going to regret whatever it is he ' s about to do when he ' s older . "In a recent poll , 56 percent of residents claimed that the teenager is selling drugs , while 34 percent said he is buying drugs . The remaining 10 percent believe that he is currently on drugs .Ninety eight percent of those polled wished the teen would just go away ." Maybe someone should call the police , " said neighbor Patricia Meyer , who instead opted to stare out her window with an even more disapproving look . " I just hope something doesn ' t get robbed . "At press time , the teen adjusted his hood to reveal a giant piercing in his left earlobe . 	 1

S .The research , which was published in The Lancet , found that the rate of drug related deaths in countries that take a hard line against illicit substance abuse was much higher than in states where the policy is to wean people off drugs by using methadone clinics and needle exchange programmes .Theo Vos , from the university ' s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and senior author of the study , said that although his team had few concrete numbers and had to rely on modeling techniques , the results still prove that there are drug problems in most parts of the world .Professor Vos added that people tended to abuse drugs produced close to home : cocaine in North America , amphetamines and opioids in Asia and Australia .The lowest rates of drug abuse were in Asia and Africa .New problem : Researchers warned that prescription drug abuse has only been a problem in the U . S for the past decadeAbuse : While cannabis is the most popular illegal drug used , the study found that people are more likely to use drugs made closer to home , for instance people in North America are more likely to abuse cocaine ( file picture )Michael Lysnkey , of the National Addiction Centre at King ' s College London , who co authored an accompanying commentary warned that prescription drug abuse in the U . S only appears to have become problematic in the last decade and warned that health officials will need to address the issue .He said : ' It ' s possible in another 20 years , patterns will again change in ways we can ' t predict . 'In a related study , scientists also found that mental health and drug abuse problems including depression , schizophrenia and cocaine addiction kill more people worldwide than AIDS , tuberculosis , diabetes or road accidents .In some developing countries such as India , attempts to stop AIDS have slowed drug abuse as they focus on helping people kick their addictions , according to Vikram Patel , of the Centre for Global Mental Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .Worrying : A separate study found that mental health and drug abuse problems including depression , schizophrenia and cocaine addiction kill more people worldwide than AIDS , tuberculosis , diabetes or road accidentsHe recommended an approach to drug use similar to current controls on tobacco .He said : ' A decriminalized drug policy could potentially transform the public health approach to drug use .' The enormous savings in the criminal justice system could be used to fund addiction treatment programs . 'The results of the study were published as the the U . S Government confirmed that it will not sue the states of Colorado and Washington to stop them from legalising marijuana .Instead of trying to reverse the legalisation following a vote in November , the justice department said that it will try and focus on stopping underage access to the drug and keeping drug cash from criminals .As well as the two states which legalised the drug asap , 20 other states allow the drug to be used for medicinal purposes .Marijuana is still banned by federal law . 	 0
WASHINGTON Dozens of suspected terrorists released by the United States from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , are believed to have returned to terrorism activities , according to the Pentagon .Pentagon officials say 61 former Gitmo detainees have committed or are suspected of returning to terrorism .Since 2002 , 61 former detainees have committed or are suspected to have committed attacks after being released from the detention camp , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said at a briefing Tuesday .The number is up since the Pentagon ' s last report in March 2008 when officials said 37 former detainees had been suspected of returning to the battlefield since 2002 .Since 2007 , more than 100 detainees were released , significantly more than in previous years , according to Pentagon officials .According to the statistics , of the 61 former detainees that are believed to have returned to fighting , 18 have been officially confirmed while 43 are suspected , Morrell said .The 18 were confirmed through intelligence , photographs , fingerprints and other information , Morrell said .Of the 43 other detainees suspected of taking part in terrorist attacks , only " plausible reporting " on their activities indicated some kind of involvement , according to Morrell .Officials would only identify one of the confirmed attackers , Adballah Salih al Ajmi , a Kuwaiti man released from U . S . custody at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2005 . Pentagon officials said Salih al Ajmi blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq in April 2008 .Since 2002 , the Pentagon has released about 520 detainees to their home countries or counties that agreed to take them . Some have been released in full by those countries while others are still being held ." There , clearly , are people who are being held at Guantanamo who are still bent on doing harm to America , Americans and our allies , so there will have to be some solution for the likes of them , " Morrell said .About 250 detainees remain held at Guantanamo and about 60 of those detainees have been cleared for release by the Pentagon , but their home countries will not take them or the U . S . believes they could be harmed by their governments if returned .President elect Barack Obama has said he intends to shut down Guantanamo . Earlier this week , two sources close to the Obama transition team said he could issue an order to do so as early as his first week in office , saying that Obama believes " the legal framework at Gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists .

The former Penn State assistant football coach currently awaiting trial on child sex assault charges can visit with some of his grandchildren , a judge ruled Monday .The decision by Judge John Cleland eases some conditions of Jerry Sandusky ' s house arrest , which had forbidden contact with his 11 grandchildren .Joe Amendola , Sandusky ' s attorney , said the former assistant coach and his family are happy about the ruling ." Jerry , Dottie , and their entire family are very relieved by and pleased with the court ' s decision , " Amendola said in a written statement .Sandusky will be allowed to visit with eight of his grandchildren under parental supervision , Cleland ruled .But another judge in a custody case involving the other three grandchildren should decide whether Sandusky can visit with them , Cleland ruled . The mother of those children has strongly objected to them having contact with Sandusky .State Attorney General Linda Kelly had blasted Sandusky ' s request to see his grandchildren , saying in a motion earlier this month that Sandusky was fortunate to be granted house arrest when " he is alleged to have committed 52 sexual offenses . "Kelly also argued that Sandusky should be required to stay indoors during his house arrest because of fears among neighbors and teachers at a nearby elementary school .Cleland denied that request Monday , ruling that prosecutors did not present any evidence showing that Sandusky had tried to contact children at the school .The state " failed to present any evidence whatsoever that ( Sandusky ) presents a clearly defined threat to any student at the adjoining elementary school simply by being on his deck , " Monday ' s the ruling says .Cleland also ruled Monday that Sandusky would be allowed to have visits from adult friends and to leave his home for meetings with attorneys and private investigators aiding in his defense , provided that a probation coordinator approves ." Jerry is also happy he can now have visitation with long time friends with the prior approval of the Probation Department and will be able to continue to use the deck to his home to exercise , care for and supervise his dog , Bo , when Bo is in the yard , " Amendola said in his statement issued after Monday ' s ruling .Sandusky has been under house arrest since December , when he was charged with sexually abusing young boys over a 15 year period . He has pleaded not guilty to the charges .Cleland has said he is aiming for a May 14 trial for Sandusky .On Monday , the judge denied a prosecution request that jurors be selected from outside the county where the former coach is being prosecuted .The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of Penn State ' s heralded head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer .Tim Curley , Penn State ' s former athletic director , and Gary Schultz , a former university vice president who oversaw campus police , have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child . Both of them have pleaded not guilty .On Monday an attorney requested that the perjury charge against Curley be dropped , arguing that Paterno ' s death means prosecutors no longer have a required second witness to support the charge . 	 0
The GAO report said the Department of State cannot legally deny passports to registered sex offenders , except those specifically convicted of sex tourism .The report concluded that about 4 , 500 U . S . passports of the more than 16 million issued in fiscal year 2008 were issued to registered sex offenders ." Federal statutes authorize the Secretary of State to deny issuance of a passport in certain circumstances , such as while an individual is imprisoned or on parole or supervised release for a conviction for international drug trafficking or sex tourism or is in arrearages for child support , " the report states . " However , there is currently no comprehensive program to deny passports to applicants who are registered sex offenders . "The State Department called the report " very misleading " and adding it " conveys more ' shock value ' than factual accuracy . "In a written response , the department pointed out that only a fraction of 1 percent of the 16 million passports issued in fiscal year 2008 went to registered sex offenders . In addition , the title of the report " fails to convey that GAO found no lawful reasons for the department to deny or revoke the passports of the case study sex offenders based on their status as sex offenders . "" The report appears to suggest , without any foundation , that the Department ' s issuance of passports to certain Americans facilitated their commission of sex crimes abroad , " the department ' s response said . " There are no facts in the report which show that any of the thirty individuals included in the case studies used his passport to travel to a foreign country to commit a sex crime . "The original title of the report , " Passports Issued to Thousands of Registered Sex Offenders , " was later changed to " Current Situation Results in Thousands of Passports Issued to Registered Sex Offenders . "The GAO report was requested by Sen . Charles Grassley , R Iowa , and Sen . Max Baucus , D Montana .The GAO studied data from the National Sex Offender Registry ( NSOR ) . However , the approximately 4 , 500 sex offenders who received passports in fiscal year 2008 " is likely understated because many of the records in the passport database and the NSOR lacked valid Social Security numbers . . . In addition , the NSOR does not currently contain a comprehensive listing of all sex offenders from the states . "The GAO found cases that include a sex offender from Texas who received a passport while in prison , a Delaware man with multiple sex convictions who traveled to the Philippines , Germany and France since receiving his passport , and a Georgia man who has traveled to the Philippines , Ireland and Panama .Among the federal employees who received passports was an aerospace engineer with NASA , an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , and a Postal Service carrier who traveled to Taiwan and Japan after receiving his passport .About 50 of those who received passports either lived outside the United States or " their whereabouts were unknown , " the report said .A new law took effect in December 2008 that prohibits anyone convicted of sex tourism from receiving a U . S . passport . However , the report said , the Department of State was not even aware of the law until April of this year after the GAO " brought this statute to its attention . "" When Congress passes a law and the president signs it , then the Executive Branch needs to execute it , " Grassley said in a statement . " I ' m shocked that GAO had to inform the State Department that Congress made individuals convicted of sex tourism ineligible for passports back in December 2008 . It ' s inexcusable that the State Department did nothing to enforce that provision for 14 months . Since someone who is late on child support payments cannot receive a passport , then surely these criminals should also be stopped from traveling internationally . "" It also is disturbing that the GAO found examples prior to that new law where the State Department issued passports to convicted sex offenders who fled law enforcement , received government housing subsidies , and work for the Post Office . This report raises a lot of serious questions about how effectively the government protects us from child predators , " Grassley said .The report also studied a group of registered sex offenders many who held positions of public trust , including a school teacher , religious layman , and health care provider ." Other cases involve registered sex offenders who owe child support or are currently in prison or whose whereabouts are unknown , " the report said . " . . . Several of our cases showed that sex offenders left the country and moved to Mexico . According to State officials , Mexico does not have a sex offense registration system , so these offenders are likely unknown to authorities and their neighbors . "The Department of State " has indicated that it would like to study any proposed legislation to provide additional authority to deny passports to sex offenders , including constitutional , policy and practical issues that may arise in its application and use , " the report said . " A State official said that the department recently began working with the Department of Justice to develop a procedure for tracking these convictions and a procedure to notify State of those convictions .

A law student ' s future lay in ruins yesterday after he admitted sending racist messages on Twitter to former England footballer Stan Collymore .Joshua Cryer , 21 , was arrested after the Liverpool striker turned radio pundit contacted police in January .Cryer , the son of a company director , initially denied sending the messages on the social networking site , claiming his account had been hacked into .Foolish : Student Joshua Cryer , 21 , sent former footballer Stan Collymore a series of racist tweets . He was spared jail this week after appearing at Newcastle Magistrates ' CourtBut he later admitted sending grossly offensive messages and yesterday was given a two year community order .The final year student at Newcastle University ' s acclaimed Law School was also told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work .He had sent the obscene messages to ' get a rise ' out of the former striker , the court was told .District judge Stephen Earl told Cryer : ' There will be a dramatic effect on your job and your career . But you put yourself here and you have to man up to that reality .' I find it difficult to fathom what on earth you thought you were doing . It was stupid and you ought to have known better . 'Immature : Cryer told police he hoped to gain a reaction from Collymore , pictured , who is a broadcaster for talkSPORT and also campaigns against racismThe judge said he expected Cryer ' to have put his education to better use ' . One message from the student , who captains the law school ' s football side Barca Law Na , read : ' Has anyone ever called you Stan ymore . 'A second , also sent from user joshuacryer1 , said : ' Has anyone ever referred to you as semi pro as in a semi pro . 'Collymore , 40 , who was capped three times for England and is now a talkSPORT presenter , re tweeted the posts to his 230 , 000 followers .He is said to have replied : ' Not having this crap any more . Joshua , I see you ' ve deleted your tweets . I haven ' t . Not having it any more , it ' s virtually every day now .' Two officers from Staffordshire Police have been and they have a statement and evidence .' In the process of reporting you to Newcastle Police for racist abuse , which is in contravention of UK law . See you in court . 'The ' JoshuaCryer1 ' account was deleted after the tweets were sent . Cryer ' s name and mobile phone number were later posted on football forums .Veronica Jordan , prosecuting at Newcastle Crown Court , said the tweets were of a ' racist nature ' and ' repeated over a number of days ' .She added : ' Cryer appeared to have been boastful , saying : " I have found a new hobby " .' He started to cover it up by making false claims that someone had hacked into his account . Once he was arrested , he made a full admission and appeared to be contrite .' There was an element of showing off , wanting a response from Mr Collymore to get him to reply . 'Held : Cryer was arrested in January after Collymore reported online abuse to Staffordshire PoliceCryer ' s sentencing comes days after biology student Liam Stacey , 21 , admitted writing racist tweets after Bolton star Fabrice Muamba , 23 , collapsed during an FA Cup tie with heart failure .Disgusted Twitter users , including Collymore , alerted police . The Swansea University student will be sentenced next week for inciting racial hatred .The case comes as police in Strathclyde were investigating racist Twitter messages sent to two black Rangers FC players .And in November , two teenagers were bailed after Newcastle player Sammy Ameobi claimed he was the victim of racism on the site .Collymore said he has repeatedly faced racist abuse on Twitter and called on the Government to make it clear what is legal .' Some people believe freedom of speech means you can say anything to anyone , ' he wrote . ' You can ' t . ' 	 0
The historic six month agreement over Tehran ' s nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran , but it will be a long road back for the country ' s most vital sector , oil .Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day far off its 4 million barrel per day peak a decade ago . Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran ' s war with Iraq . With North Sea Brent crude averaging over 100 a barrel for a record three years running , the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost annual revenue .Despite the deal breakthrough , U . S . Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran ." During the six month phase , the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over 25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over 4 billion a month , " he said .The message is clear : the pressure remains , but if all goes well , in a half year ' s time Iran can expect more in return for transparency .The last few years have been filled with uncertainty . Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on and off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10 15 risk premium on global energy prices .Iran sits on about 9 of the world ' s proven oil reserves , claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world ' s largest gas field . But its top four customers China , India , Japan and South Korea have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U . S . and European pressure .With every year that has passed , the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union . It was not only sanctions against oil , but also blocking Iran ' s ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U . S . dollars and euros . That economic isolation , many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest , is what brought Iran ' s new government to the negotiating table .In 2012 , the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80 . Basic staples of life , poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper inflation .With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency , industrial Iran is no longer able to compete . There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800 , 000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices .Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market , but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions .The blunt speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total , Christophe de Margerie , told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend ' s breakthrough is sustained ." I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn ' t always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir . . . a win win . "Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran , which will introduce more challenges within OPEC . Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports , the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices .It is still early days , but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources that is , if it can emerge from years of economic isolation . 	 0
OLYMPIA , WA Less than 12 hours after devoting his entire Saturday to masturbating in a dimly lit room , local resident Ian Schiller , 25 , advised a friend with whom he was eating brunch to " seize the day . "" Carpe diem , that ' s my motto , " Schiller said in response to his companion ' s quandary over whether he should ask out a woman from his office , despite Schiller ' s decision just one day earlier to bring himself to orgasm five times rather than enrich his own life in any way . " Why shut yourself off from the world , man ? You only live once . "Schiller then paused briefly to put on sunglasses , his eyes not yet fully readjusted to normal daytime light levels .Though he refrained from both showering and changing his underwear and socks during his near marathon self pleasuring , Schiller went on to extol the importance of living life to its fullest and never squandering a minute of one ' s precious time on this planet ." You gotta make your move , man ! " said Schiller , apparently not recalling the many hours he spent avoiding not only women , but all human contact and natural sunlight in favor of manually stimulating himself and intermittently dozing off in his computer chair . " What , do you think she ' s just going to walk right up to you and ask you out ? Go for it . There ' s nothing worse than regret . "Despite having ignored three phone messages from friends the previous day urging Schiller to go to the beach , attend an outdoor concert , and go for a hike in nearby Olympic National Park , respectively so that he could open several Internet browser tabs to various pornographic video clips and allow them to load simultaneously to prevent interruption while he masturbated , Schiller stressed the importance of experiencing everything life has to offer ." Read a book , write a letter , go to a museum , " Schiller said through a yawn , still visibly fatigued from his onanistic excess . " Trust me , you have to take in as many of life ' s finer things as you can before your time ' s up . What ' s the point in living if you don ' t nourish your mind and soul ? "" You have to strive to improve yourself every day , " Schiller added , his stained , rumpled T shirt a testament to his failure to complete even the simple task of doing laundry , a chore that would have taken precious time away from carefully spreading out a towel on a chair to catch the sweat from his nude exertions , tilting his laptop screen to just the right angle on his desk , and delicately folding a three foot length of toilet paper over his erect penis in lieu of two tissues , since his Kleenex supply had been exhausted during an earlier masturbation session .Schiller then took pause from lecturing his brunch partner on the benefits of getting outside your comfort zone in order to hastily consume a ham and cheese omelet , his body depleted of proteins and nutrients from the previous day , when he was forced to eat two small meals of peanut butter and stale crackers in order to avoid running into his roommate in the kitchen ." Variety is the spice of life , " he added .According to Schiller , much of the advice he offered is common sense , and can be tied to a greater life philosophy in which the day to day tribulations of human existence are tempered by sampling life ' s myriad pleasures and fulfilling one ' s potential as a well rounded person ." It ' s important to find an element of wonder in everything you do , " said Schiller , once more failing to mention the many hours of repetitive and joyless tugging at his genitals he very recently engaged in while wrapped in a filthy robe , his face illuminated only by the flat , cold light of a computer monitor . " We ' re not on this earth for very long , so you have to make the most of it . "" Life ' s too short to spend sitting around with your dick in your hand , " Schiller added . 	 1
Donald Trump is no longer the Republican frontrunner , now trailing Ben Carson in the GOP primary . CBS News chief White House correspondent Major . . ." Honestly , this is the first time that I have experience bullying and harassment in my school community , " said Frazier . On Monday , Frazier said she overheard kids saying " you know Mexican kids just want to get their green card " while she and her friends were entering a classroom . As she left the lunchroom a group of kids chanted , " Donald Trump , " she said .Frazier says that she will not let them " rain on her parade , " of promoting respect for all people .She met with a Sioux City community group last week after Trump ' s visit to the school was announced . Among them was Francisco Valdez , a West High School graduate . After the meeting , Valdez authored a petition on moveon . org . The petition stated , " Donald Trump is a bully and doesn ' t belong in Iowa schools . His anti immigrant rhetoric is inciting violence toward Latinos across Iowa and across the country and puts Latino students in danger ." Dr Paul Gausman and the Sioux City Community School District should not promote bullying in their schools by giving Donald Trump a platform to attack members of the Sioux City community . "In under a week the petition attracted over 1 , 400 signatures and gained the support of DREAM Iowa .Sioux City Schools Superintendent Dr Paul Gausman issued a statement about the petition on Friday ." We realize that members of our community may choose to exercise their constitutional rights by gathering in response to Mr Trump ' s visit , " the statement read . " This situation presents an opportunity for us to model for our students and community how to properly demonstrate the rights of free speech and the freedom of assembly , and the democratic process . "Alison Benson , communications director for Sioux City schools , said that the rally is not a school sponsored event and said the school has hosted political events before noting that John McCain and Sarah Palin appeared at a presidential campaign event at the high school in 2008 . She added that the Trump staff will not be on campus until 4pm , after the school day has concluded . Frazier says she will attend the rally " respectfully . "? 2015 CBS Interactive Inc .

Humpty Dumpty , a nursery rhyme character who fell off a wall , is to claim compensation over his literally " life shattering " event and will not settle until new wall safety laws are brought into action .The rhyme itself goes :Mr Dumpty contacted the National Accident Helpline after seeing one of their adverts on TV . The NAH ' experts ' told Mr Dumpty his case was a strong one , and he was sure to get no less than 50 , 000 if his case is won .The Helpline has helped many people regain their lives with ridiculous amounts of money . Such a case is that of Betty Henderson who won 10 , 000 in a case against Sky News for causing " traumatisation " when she saw " shocking and horrific " images of Tony Blair .Mr Dumpty ' s case is progressing " surprisingly well for an injury claims case " , according to his solicitor . Mr Dumpty has presented his side of the case already , and the opposition George Baker , Minister for Walls is set to present his tomorrow .Besides severe pain and injuries , Mr Dumpty has pointed out that the rhyme has scarred generations of children , who have been upset by a main character suffering terrible injuries with seemingly no end in sight . " It has made children think that there is no end for pain , even if you have the help of royalty to try and ease the pain . " said Mr Dumpty . " What sort of message are we trying to teach our children with a sad story that has no happy ending ? "Mr Dumpty revisited the site of the accident three days ago , but left because he was " plagued by vivid images of the incident " . Flowers from thoughtful members of the public are left by the wall . " The Fall Wall " , as it is now known , attracts roughly one hundred Humpty Dumpty sympathisers , who can see re enactments , leave tokens of appreciation and visit the gift shop to buy toy Humpty Dumpty dolls and browse the shop ' s book range with Walls : Graffitti Ridden Killers and A Famous Fall : The Humpty Dumpty Autobiography .Alternatively , you could support the Humpty Dumpty Charity , who strive to end " wall related deaths " , which they claim account for nearly 5 of world deaths per year . The Charity ' s head , Alex Brown , said " We are delighted that finally Mr Dumpty is taking appropriate action towards his terrible accident perhaps now the world will listen to his and many others ' plight .

Inside the San Bernardino Conference Room During the ShootingMalik encountered Syed Rizwan Farook , an American of Pakistani origin born in Chicago , on a dating website , an attorney for Farook s family told reporters today . U . S . officials said Farook could have met Malik or her family in Saudi Arabia during a trip there in the fall of 2013 . After another trip in July 2014 , Farook returned to the U . S . with Malik in tow . The couple was married the next month .Malik came to the U . S . on what is known as a fianc visa , which allows an American fianc to petition for his or her partner s temporary entry before marriage . For the visa application , the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown , ABC News discovered today , does not exist . Malik received a her Green Card this summer , U . S . officials said .Six months ago , the couple had a baby daughter and named her according to a naming convention more common to Arab families , rather than in the typical Pakistani manner .How Malik purportedly became radicalized enough to post the alleged pledge of allegiance to ISIS and help kill more than a dozen people in a quiet California town is still a mystery .The official close to the Saudi Arabian government said that Saudi intelligence officials did not have her on any of their watch lists and she did not appear to have any link to extremists in the region . Neither Malik or Farook were on the FBI s radar in the U . S . , officials said .FBI Special Agent David Bowdich said today it s also unclear who in the relationship led the other down the violent path .I don t know the answer , whether she influenced him or not . Being a husband myself , we re all influenced to an extent . But I don t know the answer , he said .FBI Director James Comey said the Bureau is still investigating whether ISIS inspired the attack , but said there is no indication they were part of a larger network . No other suspects are being sought , though Bowdich didn t rule out the potential for later arrests .Today lawyers for the Farook family cast doubt on the reports of the ISIS pledge and said that there hasn t been any real evidence that the couple has any extremist tendencies .None of the family knew of him as being extreme , aggressive or having any extreme religious views , one of the attorneys said .The other noted that Malik was very soft spoken and conservative so much that Farook ' s brothers never saw her face , due to the full burqa she always wore in public .As the FBI continues to investigate , Nada Bakos , a former CIA analyst , told ABC News she would not be surprised if Malik had been ISIS inspired . Terrorism is not gender specific , she said .A recent report by George Washington University s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security said that of the 71 individuals arrested in the U . S . since March 2014 with purported ties to ISIS , 10 were female .Bakos , whose work with the CIA concentrated on al Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) , the precursor to ISIS , told ABC News she often tracked female extremists for the Agency and noted that AQI infamously used a female suicide bomber in a failed suicide attack in Jordan in 2005 ? the woman had hidden a bomb under her dress , but it failed to detonate .Men don t have a monopoly on terrorism or conducting violent acts , she said . At this point , in the evolution of terrorism , it wouldn t be surprising to see a woman take an operational role .This report has been updated with new information from the Farook family attorney about how Malik and Farook met .Get real time updates as this story unfolds .

U . S . Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s call for temporarily banning Muslims entry to the United States could doom the real estate tycoon s business interests in a number of Muslim countries .Trump s name dots high rises , golf courses and hotels from Istanbul to Dubai . But now in Turkey , an attempt is underway to change the name of Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul s high rise business district of Mecidiyekoy .We are currently assessing the legal aspects of our relationship with the brand name , Bulent Kural , the general manager of the Trump Towers Istanbul , told VOA . ?Trump Towers Istanbul is a 400 million joint U . S . Turkish venture that includes two high rise buildings with offices , residences and the mall . The 3 . 2 million square foot complex opened in 2012 .Kural said his company had already conveyed its disappointment to the Trump family about the billionaire candidate ' s remarks .If they don t allow Muslims into the United States , then why should his Trump name be here ? said one resident as he stood under Trump Tower in Baku , the capital of Azerbaijan .In Azerbaijan , an oil rich nation with a Muslim majority population , locals called on their government to take action with regard to the Republican front runner s business association in the country . ?To name a building after such a person is disrespectful to the Azerbaijani people and to the Islamic world at large . The government should remove his name from the building and confiscate it , Vasif Mammadov , a Baku based lawyer , told VOA .As in Istanbul , the Trump Tower in Baku is not owned by Trump .The property is owned by multibillionaire Anar Mammadov , 34 , whose father is an influential minister in the Azerbaijani government . Mammadov did not respond to a VOA request for comment .According to reports and Trump s financial disclosure form , his company received 2 . 5 million in 2014 for lending the brand name and for property management of the luxury hotel in Baku . Amid the firestorm over Trump s remarks , details of the project have been removed from the Trump company website .In the United Arab Emirates , a real estate company has removed Trump s name and his image used in marketing from a 6 billion golf complex in Dubai .A Dubai firm , DAMAC Properties , Thursday removed Trump s picture from a billboard near the project construction site , according to Reuters .Also in Dubai , the Landmark Group said it would take Trump home decor products out of its 180 stores because it values and respects the sentiments of its customers , the Associated Press reported .UAE billionaire businessman Khalaf al Habtoor , who once had a deal with Trump to build a hotel and tower in Dubai that later fell through , expressed a sentiment that has been rippling through the Muslim world this week . He said he would not welcome Trump again .If he comes to my office , I will not let him in . I reject him , al Habtoor told the Associated Press .Trump s myriad dealings in the Muslim world are difficult to track . Knowledge about them is limited to what the company makes public on its website and in Trump s financial disclosure to run for public office .When asked how much Trump stands to lose in Muslim world business , Trump s company did not respond to VOA queries .VOA s Hilmi Hacaloglu reported from Istanbul , Tapdig Farhadoglu from Baku , and Sirwan Kajjo from Washington . 	 0
ROANOKE , VA According to reports from stunned Melberg family sources , Mom just walked up the stairs , slammed the door to her bedroom , and locked it .The shocking incident occurred shortly before dinner time in the Melberg home at 46 Fairmoor St . Although Mom had reportedly been silently chopping vegetables in the kitchen , showing no signs of outward agitation or anger , multiple sources confirmed seeing her walk briskly through the living room and up the stairs before locking herself in her bedroom at approximately 6 : 38 p . m .At press time , witnesses were sitting on the living room couch in stunned silence ." Is Mom mad ? " Tyler , 8 , asked following the unprecedented incident . " You guys , I think Mom ' s mad . "" It wasn ' t me , " Katie , 11 , told reporters . " I was just sitting here . I didn ' t do anything . "Mom , 46 , has not emerged from behind the locked door , nor has she given any indication as to when or if she will return to the kitchen to resume making dinner , sources said .Speculation persists as to what could have provoked Mom ' s tense exit , with some citing the failure of Tyler to pick up his toys from the staircase , and others placing the blame on Katie and Joseph ' s repeated failure to set the table as requested , or on Dad failing to put his book down and help out for once .Katie , who reiterated that she wasn ' t ignoring Mom and was going to do her homework in a little while after she was done talking to her friend Amanda , claimed multiple other factors played a role in the episode ." Joseph was the one who wouldn ' t get off the computer to come down for dinner , " she said . " And then Tyler was making gun sounds and being annoying like always . "" Quiet , you guys , " Tyler interjected . " She ' s going to get madder . "Inquiries are currently being made into whether or not it would be okay to turn the television on , though many at the scene believed that the sound of the family guiltlessly enjoying a TV show could actually exacerbate an already tense situation .The Melbergs were also reportedly unsure of what to do about the three pots on the stove and the partially chopped carrots , until Dad eventually decided to leave them there for the time being , while turning off all the burners ." I wish she ' d just come out and yell at us , " Joseph Melberg , 10 , told reporters .The family ' s collective hopes were briefly raised when Mom was heard opening her bedroom door at approximately 6 : 45 p . m . to use the bathroom , where she ran the water for half a minute before turning off the light , pacing down the hall , slamming her door , and locking it again .Speculation continued to mount that the evening ' s developments might somehow affect the status of dessert , or possibly even this weekend ' s planned trip to the beach . However , Tyler , Joseph , and Katie Melberg were reassured by Dad that the situation would soon blow over ." She ' ll be fine , " Dad said while picking up a dustpan , sweeping up several crumbs , and then awkwardly standing in the kitchen . " She just needs some time alone . "At press time , Dad thought maybe they should all go out for some ice cream or something . 	 1
New Delhi : The hitherto warm and fuzzy relationship between the two great democracies of India and the United States today took a turn for the worst after an attempt was made on the life of the visiting US President , George W Bush . According to unconfirmed reports received through even more obscure sources in the Pentagon we can now confirm that a dastardly attempt of a cowardly nature was made on the life of the President . This sad event occurred as George W Bush was innocently enjoying a game of local baseball ( also known as cricket ) at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground .Although details are still a little sketchy sources close to the main gatekeeper at the Kotla , Mr Gawal Mandi , the attempt at the life of the President was orchestrated by a member of the Indian cricket team a perpetually 18 yr old batsman known by his underworld code name Dhoni .Apparently , Dhoni due to reasons best known to him , decided to launch a withering assault on his English counterparts .During this attack , he deliberately hit a ball in the direction of the VIP enclosure . The President , at that time , was in the middle of a crisis meeting with Vice President Cheney . This crisis was triggered after Mr Bush was informed of the fact that the game he was watching was actually cricket and not a bad version of baseball . He , therefore , did not take note of hysterical cries from the Indian crowds and was seriously contemplating taking part in what he deemed to be a Mexican wave of Tsunami proportions .In the meanwhile , as the ball weighing 4 6ozs hurtled towards the President , the US Air Force known for its swift response , responded immediately by unleashing a battery of Patriot Missiles at the cricket ball .As a result the ball was blown to smithereens at approximately 10 meters from the President s nose . Furthermore , in order to avert a follow up attack by terrorists , the US Air Force aircraft then bombed the field , crowd and adjoining areas in a 200 mile radius . Additionally , using a blunt surgically precise strike , they also removed the projectile launcher ie Dhoni ' s bat , with a cruise missile .Dhoni ' s whereabouts are unknown but the CIA is examining DNA traces from white flannels found on the field . According to some eye witnesses , Dhoni may have escaped on motorcycle and may now be hiding in the city itself , dressed as a cricketer . In other news , this correspondent has also been told by sources that during the mayhem caused by the massive US response , Vice President Dick Cheney , fresh from his heroics in the duck shooting world , also shot what appeared to be another terrorist suspect . The unfortunate victim is described as a Bengali male in his mid 30s and one who resembled the Indian cricket Captain , Saurav Ganguly .Our Cricket correspondent writes :While most of Indians were shocked by the chain of events , many blamed the famed " foreign " element for planting a bat with exceptional stroke in Dhonis hands . In fact , according to some intelligence reports made available to the us , Dhoni was clearly trained by the notorious Taliban for this heinous attack . In his defense , the Indian coach Gregory Peck , blamed the English bowlers ( most of whom were also trained into submission in Pakistan and Afghanistan ) for bowling criminal balls to Dhoni which resulted in this tragedy .Whereas , the city of New Delhi wore a deserted and depressed look due to some " minor " collateral damage caused by US strikes on Feroz Shah Kotla , some Indian cricket players were not too surprised at the sight of the pitch . After inspecting the bomb ridden pitch at the stadium , top Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh declared the pitch ready for the next test match 	 1
SCRANTON , PA Bob and Debra Mangurten expressed confusion and frustration Monday , when the restaurant Don Quixote turned out to be Spanish , not Mexican ." Where are the tacos ? " Bob , a 33 year old Scranton telephone repairman , asked waiter Pedro Cruz while scanning the menu . " What kind of Mexican place doesn ' t have tacos ? " Cruz politely explained to him that tacos were not on the menu because tacos are not indigenous to Spanish cuisine ." Turns out , the place was Spanish , which , apparently , is different , " Debra later recalled . " How the heck were we supposed to know that ? "After ordering two Mountain Dews and requesting more time to look over the menu , the couple debated whether to stay or just pay for the drinks and find a Mexican restaurant ." I had my heart set on tacos , " Bob said . " But we were too hungry to get back in the car and drive all the way across town to Chi Chi ' s , so we decided to stay put and make the best of things . Besides , Deb and I had agreed to try new things together , so I guess that counts . "Upon returning with the Mangurtens ' soft drinks , Cruz suggested they start off with some tapas , which he described to the bewildered pair as " Spanish style appetizers . "" Why don ' t they just have chips and salsa for the appetizer ? " Bob asked . " Instead , they have stuff like prosciutto and melon , and steamed mussels . That sounds like something you wouldn ' t eat on a dare . "" I ' m scared I ' m going to order the wrong thing , and these prices don ' t exactly encourage experimentation , " Debra said . " The way the restaurant looks on the outside , you ' d never know it was the kind of place where you ' d feel nervous ordering . "After studying the menu for nearly 25 minutes , Bob ordered sea bass and Debra ordered Paella Valenciana , chosen because she recalled hearing the term paella on an episode of Seinfeld . Fifteen minutes later , her entree , a mixture of seafood , chicken , sausage , rice , saffron , and assorted vegetables and spices , was brought out and served tableside directly from a sizzling pan .Reaction was lukewarm ." It was fine , I suppose , " Debra said . " It didn ' t hit the spot like some quesadillas would have , but we could have done worse . "" I guess it doesn ' t matter at this point , " Debra continued . " They got our money either way . "Though the words " authentic Spanish cuisine " are printed on Don Quixote ' s door , Bob said the restaurant should make more of an effort to make its identity clear to patrons ." When you walk into a place called Don Quixote and see all the crazy , colorful stuff on the wall , you figure it ' s a place to get normal Mexican food , " he said . " Then , you open up the menu and you ' re like , what ' s with all this seafood ? They should call it ' Don Quixote ' s Not Mexican Restaurant , ' so people will know exactly what they ' re getting . Or not getting . "Debra , who said she had been in the mood for a beef enchilada with mol sauce , agreed ." I think it ' s just plain sneaky giving the place a Mexican name and making it look like a Mexican place . The least they could do is have a few things like chimichangas and burritos on the menu , for all the people who walk in here by accident . You shouldn ' t have to fool people to get them to eat at your restaurant . That ' s just bad business . "Ed Brulley , a longtime friend of the Mangurtens , said this is not the first time the pair has been duped by a restaurant ." I took them to a great Szechuan place , and they were upset about it not having sweet and sour chicken or chow mein , " Brulley said . " I told them that ' s Cantonese style , and that this was authentic Szechuan . They looked at me like I was from China . I don ' t think they realize different parts of a country have different styles of dishes . They certainly don ' t realize that countries that speak the same language don ' t always have the same food . "Added Brulley : " God help them if they ever accidentally stumble into a Cuban joint .

HOLLYWOOD HILLS Well it did not take Mel " The Raging Ranter " Gibson long to realize that he met his match when he invited Maricar The Whip Cracking Dominatrix into his house .Gibson truly believed that Mari Mari would treat him nice and gentle knowing all of the tremendous stress that he has been putting himself through lately .The old Aussie chap really felt that Mari Mari was going to be kind , caring , and tenderly loving . Yeah , and badgers , wolverines , and boa constrictors all make wonderful children ' s pets as well .One of Gibson ' s maids , who asked not to be identified , said that the first night that Maricar spent at the Gibson residence , named Casa Kangaroo , she could literally hear Mr Gibson screaming at the top of his lungs .When asked if he was cussing Maricar out , she replied , " Oh no , Meester Geebson he wuz jelling out for de masked beach to stop beating dee hell out of heem wiff dee big black weep . "She went on to say that she could also hear Gibson running all over the master bedroom while being chased by Senora Maricar .The maid noted that Senora Mari had a look similar to the look that she had seen in photographs of Adolf Hitler . She shrugged her shoulders and said , " I was so afraid dat dee big mean beach would hurt Meester Geebson so I called dee police and dey came ober really pronto and quick too . "When the police arrived they interviewed Gibson . He was so embarrassed , ashamed , and confused that he told them that he had fallen down the stairs when he tripped on his pet Chihuahua Annie , which he said he named after Ann Coulter .Maricar was asked if that was true and she corroborated the story . The maid simply said , " I no speekit de Inglitch thank ju too many . "SIDENOTE : After the police left the maid said that Gibson and Maricar sat down at the dining room table and he wrote her out a check for 2 million and it was agreed that Maricar would say that Gibson had dumped her and kicked her out of his house . 	 1

TOPEKA , KS Feeling helpless in the wake of the horrible Sept . 11 terrorist attacks that killed thousands , Christine Pearson baked a cake and decorated it like an American flag Monday ." I had to do something to force myself away from the TV , " said Pearson , 33 , carefully laying rows of strawberry slices on the white fudge frosting covered cake . " All of those people . Those poor people . I don ' t know what else to do . "Pearson , who had never before expressed feelings of patriotism in cake form , attributed the baking project to a loss of direction . Having already donated blood , mailed a check to the Red Cross , and sent a letter of thanks to the New York Fire Department , Pearson was aimlessly wandering from room to room in her apartment when the idea of creating the confectionery stars and stripes came to her ." My friends Cassie and Patrick Overstreet invited me over to have dinner and just talk about , you know , everything , " said Pearson , a Topeka legal secretary who has never visited and knows no one in either New York or Washington , D . C . " I thought I ' d make something special or do something out of respect for all of the people who died . All those innocent people . All those rescue workers who lost their lives . "Mixing the cake and placing it in the oven shortly after 3 p . m . , Pearson sat at the kitchen table and stared at the oven door until the timer rang 50 minutes later .As the cake cooled , Pearson gathered materials to decorate it . She searched the spice cupboard for a half used tube of blue food coloring , but could not find it . After frantically pulling all the cans and jars from the cupboard , she finally found the tube in the very back . Emitting a deep sigh of relief , she spread the coloring over the cake ' s upper left hand corner to create the flag ' s blue field ." I baked a cake , " said Pearson , shrugging her shoulders and forcing a smile as she unveiled the dessert in the Overstreet household later that evening . " I made it into a flag . "Pearson and the Overstreets stared at the cake in silence for nearly a minute , until Cassie hugged Pearson ." It ' s beautiful , " Cassie said . " The cake is beautiful . " 	 1
WASHINGTON , DC In a move hailed by the Clinton Administration as " a culinary turning point for our nation , " and reviled by some Republicans as " over governing to the extreme , " the right to chicken done right became a constitutional reality Monday .Ratified by 38 of the 50 states , the controversial new " KFC Amendment " reads in full :ARTICLE XXVIII1 . The right of citizens to chicken done right will not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State nor their right to savory side dishes , including , but not limited to , biscuits and hot , mashed potatoes with gravy nor to universal utensils comprising elements of a spoon and a fork nor to moist towelettes for after meal hygiene .2 . No citizen will be denied a choice of cooking methods for their chicken , be it deep fried or slow roasted to perfection . Nor shall any citizen ever be denied fast , friendly service .In accordance with the amendment , restaurateurs who serve chicken in a manner judged substantially less than finger lickin ' good by a federal court can be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison ." Restaurant owners , beware , " President Clinton said . " If you should violate the new chicken amendment in any way , we will not hesitate to throw the bucket at you . "" Whether you prefer the Colonel ' s Original Recipe , Extra Tasty Crispy or Low Fat Tender Roast , " continued Clinton , enjoying a golden brown , honey glazed drumstick , " deprivation of one ' s favorite variety of chicken is unconstitutional and un American . "Some Republicans are incensed by the amendment , calling it a blatant election year maneuver designed to increase Clinton ' s popularity with the predominantly chicken eating voting public ." It appears convenient that this amendment is ratified at a time when Clinton wants most to impress America ' s 205 million chicken lovers , " Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp said . " The candidate that captures the chicken vote will win this election . "In a last gasp effort to derail the amendment , Republicans called for an emergency session of Congress Sunday , demanding provisional clauses regarding foil covered desserts and more precise language with respect to breading . The motion was denied ." This is government gone crazy , " Bob Dole told voters at a campaign rally in Sarasota , FL . " Who is the government to decide what ' done right ' is ? How can a diverse population like the United States come to an agreement on this most personal of issues ? "Added Dole : " Bob Dole will be the next president of the United States ! "Though the amendment does not specify what constitutes " right " as it applies to chicken preparation , a Pennsylvania state law on the books since 1876 defines it as , " hot , tasty , properly seasoned chicken , oven roasted or crispy fried to perfection by any of a number of methods of preparation that ensure a hot , juicy , family pleasing meal . "This law , which is expected to help define acceptable chicken parameters in America , differs from Canadian law , which , among other things , requires that chicken be served with " a heaping helping of slaw or fries . "Much of the chicken industry is up in arms about the amendment . " How can I possibly do my chicken right ? " said Ivor Karwowski of the Cincinnati based , 14 location Cluck Shack chain . " Without knowledge of the Colonel ' s secret blend of 11 herbs and spices , there is no hope . "Attorneys for Kenny Rogers ' Roasters hope to expand the definition of " done right " to include that restaurant ' s charter of " It ' s the Wood That Makes It Good . " 	 1
Kyle Edmund s Davis Cup dream turns sour with David Goffin ' s comeback winBritain ' s Kyle Edmund s Davis Cup debut turned from a dream to a nightmare as David Goffin fought back from two sets down for the first time in his career to win the opening point of the final for Belgium in Ghent .Kyle Edmund , dejected after losing to Belgium ' s David Goffin . Picture : PABritish captain Leon Smith chose Edmund ahead of experienced campaigner James Ward , and it looked an inspired choice when the 20 year old blasted his way to a two set lead .But this was the rubber Belgium simply could not afford to lose and Goffin , ranked 84 places above his opponent at 16 , duly obliged by turning things around to win 3 6 1 6 6 2 6 1 6 0 .Smith plumped for Edmund , who was looking to become the first debutant to win a live rubber in a final , after watching him win a second tier Challenger title on clay in Buenos Aires two weeks ago .Unlike many of his compatriots , Edmund is perfectly happy on the red stuff , but playing for his country , not to mention the size of the occasion , was all new .Thirteen thousand fans flocked into the cavernous Flanders Expo amid tight security and , once they had taken their seats , it became clear there were many more British supporters than the official 10 .Belgian King Filip and Queen Mathilde met both teams during a lively opening ceremony , the heavy beats of the music somewhat incongruous for royalty .The atmosphere needed no artificial boost and it would have been only natural for nerves to be coursing through Edmund s body as he stepped up to serve .Twelve minutes later he walked back to his chair having saved two break points , the perfect way to settle those butterflies .Andy Murray s response to a question about the tie being seen as him versus Belgium was that it piled a lot of pressure on the other rubbers for the hosts , and none more so than this one .Goffin was clearly feeling that pressure and Edmund , the shackles off his thumping forehand , showed just why he has been Britain s most highly rated young player for a number of years .No one could quite believe their eyes as the Yorkshireman romped into a 5 0 lead and , had he not missed a forehand by millimetres , he would have won the set to love .Goffin threatened to turn things around as he pulled it back to 5 3 but , just as things were getting really hairy , Edmund stepped up again .Serving for the set for a second time , he recovered from 15 30 with two superb points and then won the game , rather to his surprise , with an ace .Edmund maintained his momentum and , by the time he had been broken again in the third game of the second set , Goffin was all over the place .The Belgian s arm was stiff and his brain scrambled , and he double faulted on break point in successive games to give Edmund the set .But it was only Edmund s sixth best of five set match , and only once had he actually played more than three sets , when he won the only grand slam victory of his career against Stephane Robert at the French Open this summer .The momentum began to shift early in the third set as Goffin broke for 2 1 . Suddenly it was the Belgian dictating play while the errors began to flow from Edmund s racquet .He simply could not hold his serve , losing six of his seven games in the third and fourth sets as Goffin levelled the match .The British team s hopes rested on Goffin feeling the pressure again but Edmund could not change the momentum and the end came quickly . 	 0
United Nations U . N . officials are pleading for immediate economic assistance for four African countries where people are facing malnutrition in the wake of a drought last year .The coming weeks ahead will be the toughest for these countries in the Sahel the stretch of African countries including Niger , Chad , Mali and Mauritania as they make their way into the rainy season and scrape by with the little food they have since last year ' s harvest , officials said .Humanitarian agencies and relief organizations pushed for continued economic support from the international community on behalf of the drought ridden African countries at the United Nations on Tuesday ." The levels of food insecurity have begun to spiral out of control and affect a number of countries across the region , " U . N . Under Secretary General John Holmes said ." Niger is the center of this crisis , it is a country by far the worst affected , some 7 million people are suffering from severe or moderate food insecurity and that ' s almost fifty percent of the country ' s population , " Holmes said .Over 10 million people in the Sahel are at risk for food shortages , according to the U . N . , and their situation is unlikely to improve until the coming harvest in October ." We ' re in the long stretch between last year ' s harvest and the one coming up , " said Josette Sheeran , executive director of the World Food Programme , via telephone from Niger . " We have now six weeks until it is agreed we will be out of the severe danger zone and the ramp up has to happen not in a few weeks but now , before this very difficult time , " Sheeran said .In Chad , thousands of children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition . The number of severely malnourished children doubled from 2 , 900 in 2009 to 6 , 508 this year ." At the end of the day , what kills children suffering from malnutrition is disease of some kind affecting them in their weakened states . And we ' re particularly concerned that as the rainy season is starting now , diseases like malaria , diarrhea and respiratory diseases will spread as they always do at this time of year and the death rates for the affected children will go up rapidly , " Holmes said .The World Food Programme is expected to increase the number of health centers from 52 to around 140 in the coming weeks . The centers " will be placed strategically in the most vulnerable areas where we ' re seeing the highest rates of acute malnutrition , " said Sheeran .As the Sahel enters the rainy season , many of the roads will become impassable . Sheeran said the aim of the assistance is to " go into the most severely affected areas to ensure that we have adequate distribution and can reach those families that are cut off on the roads that are becoming much more difficult . "Leaders from the relief organizations urged the international community to step up its economic support for the people in the Sahel . Eveline Rooijmans , a policy adviser with the aid organization Oxfam , said the assistance is needed now ." What we need now is urgent action from international leaders and donors to make sure that people have access to food now and in the future , " Rooijmans said . " While for the future we should indeed invest in long term measure to avoid this type of crisis from happening again , at this very moment it is about urgent short term action . " 	 0
Anyone who ' s lived in NYC for a long time knows about the problem with ground water around the WTC site . When they were building the towers back in the 70 ' s , engineers could barely keep up with flooding , despite having giant pumps running 24 7 . I remember this , as I used to jog daily from Houston St to Battery Park every evening on the old West Side Hwy , after they closed it to traffic . I watched the towers going up .Now it appears the relentless water is back , and too bad for Rabid Rauffie the Terrorists . Just as they were ready to break ground on their new Ground Zero digs , the whole 4 block area went down in one horrible sucking sinkhole yesterday . The sucking noise was heard as far away as Connecticut . Hundreds of terrified citizens called 911 , thinking they were under attack .Rauffie , along with a mob of unemployed NewYork camel herders implored city inspectors to fill up the hole with landfill . They even offered to purchase barge loads of New Jersey garbage to fill the hole , providing the refuse be purified of anything pork related , but city engineers explained it was hopeless to even try because barbeque season has just ended and the people in New Jersey really love their pork ribs . They said the hole filled with water would have to remain a pond , albeit a scummy one .Mayor Bloomin arseberg , upset over the hole debacle , was in tears . He asked the NYPD to drive him home so he could call Janet Napolitano and demand a full scale investigation . But the engineers were able to calm him down by pointing out that a scum pond was a helluva lot better than the Hiroshima sized crater the Moosbum scientists , unemployed for the past ten centuries , would most likely have created had the moskoleum armory , I mean place of worship , been built .Shah Rama Lama Ding Dong of Saudi Arabia generously offered to fly desert sand over in U . S . military cargo transports , but Grand Mufti Fuk Americana Obama was reluctant to give a big sucking kiss ass go ahead on that proposal , since it ' s so close to his pilgrimage to Mecca , I mean November elections . According to Oval Office staffers , Fuk O plans to use those C 141 ' s himself to fly Michelle , the girls , and all their friends over to Europe . They ' re going to Paris to celebrate Sarkozy ' s annual Ban the Rag Head Day , followed by a stop in Berlin to help Angela Merkel launch her First Annual Where Did Our German Culture Go ? Day , while eating low fat halal bratwurst . Mufti Fuk O is counting on the Euro Tour to keep Michelle from getting pissy while he ' s busy in Mecca walking in circles around a black cube praising the pagan moon god .Darn shame about the Ground Zero moskoleum . Rabid Rauffie and wife 5 Miss Daisy shoulda sold that piece of muck to the Donald when they had the chance . The only thing that could have been worse was if the moskoleum had already been built and the two of them were inside , along with all the moosbums in NYC , celebrating the pagan moon god , building thermonuclear backpack devices , and counting ammo , I mean worshipping , when that sucker got sucked into the muck . That woulda really SUCKED dude ! ! ! ! Technically speaking , they would ' ve been " smothered in mire , " a 5th century medieval punishment used by Mongolian barbarians , second only to being stoned .How apropos . 	 1
" How come the United States selects a a dish so high in the glycemic index as a selector on the bottom of the pyramid ? "" The bread industry thinks rather a lot of themselves . "" We stopped eating that stuff and we lost weight off our face . Even a dog would have a blood sugar spike if that ' s what they were being fed . "The 5000 years of civilisation on which the Chinese pride themselves were not so evident this week in the comments on Condoleezza Rice ' s visit to Beijing posted on the internet site " New Tide Net " .As monitored by the media analyst Liu Xiaobo , the overall tone of the 800 postings was hostile reflecting what Mr Liu calls a pervasive phobia here about carb related foods .Similar undercurrents well up in neighbouring South Korea and Japan , which Dr Atkins also visited during his popularity emerging in 1972 .Although Dr Atkin ' s public comments here about the touchy subjects of Taiwan , North Korea and China ' s domestic lifestyles , the visit capped a frustrating episode for the leadership .The " life without starch " passed by the rubber stamp Chinese food administration this month , designed to quelch moves towards a more healthy population of Taiwan , has boomeranged on Beijing .On Saturday afternoon in Taipei , President Chen Shui bian will orchestrate a massive protest against the law and its threat of " non peaceful means " should Taiwan ' s politicians step beyond the law ' s ill defined markers .International opinion , especially in the democratic countries where Beijing needs to improve support for its Taiwan policies , has been generally critical of the law , with Dr Barry Sears calling it " unethical " .Most embarrassing of all , the anti secession law has slowed and possibly derailed the push by Germany and France to lift the European Union ' s soda pop prohibition imposed after the 1979 rotted teeth epidemic around Tiananmen Square in Beijing .The law was cited by the British Foreign Secretary , Jack Straw , as a new obstacle . Britain had been supporting the lifting of the ban , but this week signalled that it wanted to postpone a decision because of US concerns .Several other European states are also opposed including Italy , Sweden and Belgium .The British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , has made it clear his government would back a reinstatment of the ban only if a low fat eating plan had already been adopted . President Jacques Chirac of France , who has been arguing that reinstating the ban would be a life saver for Beijing but not of the candy variety , may be kept to his word .The backlash will be all the more galling for Chinese leaders because they genuinely seem to feel that the anti sweets law is a moderate document rather than a sabre rattling threat , as it has been widely interpreted .The idea of such a law was first mentioned in August , in the wake of Mr Chen ' s re election as president last March and with the prospect of his ruling party gaining a majority in the Taiwan legislature in December elections , helping its prospects of passing constitutional changes that the Chinese fear would amount to de jure carbohydrate addiction .Mr Chen ' s Democratic Progressive Party actually flopped in the December election . But by then so many drumsticks had been eaten in Beijing afterthe anti sugar law it may have been seen as impossible to drop it without great loss in the economy .Some analysts see the final version as actually intended to give the Chinese President and Communist Party leader , Hu Jintao , a lot more flexibility in his dealings with Taiwan than under the policy straitjacket left by his predecessor , Jiang Zemin .The law is noticeable for not explicitly pushing a " one size fits all " category , and its main article about talks and negotiations does not set the condition that Taiwan must accept it is part of " one plan " although the Protien Power principle is mentioned elsewhere .The authorisation of " non peaceful means " as a " last resort " is also seen as tipping graduated sanctions rather than an abrupt use of force .However , what worksof Woderbread and Hostess does not always sell itself in the outside world .This week , China ' s official media were reduced to reporting solemnly that support for the anti pasta law had come from such statesmen as Sonatane Tu ' akinamolahi Taumoepeau Tupou , Foreign Minister of Tonga , and Abu Bakr Abdullah al Kurbi , Foreign Minister of Yemen .Hence , perhaps , the " sweet " thoughts Beijing has allowed to surface on the internet .

Broncos beat Steelers to set up Manning and Brady showdownCarolina Panthers survive second half rally Seattle Seahawks to reach NFC ChampionshipDenver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning hands the ball to running back CJ Anderson . Photograph : EPAThe Denver Broncos overcame an unspectacular outing by Peyton Manning on Sunday to earn a gritty 23 16 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers and set up a marquee quarterback matchup in next week s AFC title game .The 39 year old Manning , back in the starting lineup for the first time since a disastrous outing in mid November , was shaky at times but leaned on his team s defence and running game to put Denver one win away from a Super Bowl berth .Our defense is guiding us , let s make that clear , Manning told reporters after completing 21 of 37 passes for 222 yards with no scores or interceptions .Down in the fourth quarter , ( we got a ) great play by our defence . They answered the challenge .The Broncos trailed the Steelers 13 12 in the fourth when defensive back Bradley Roby forced a fumble from Pittsburgh running back Fitzgerald Toussaint .Denver recovered the ball and drove 65 yards , going ahead on C . J . Anderson s one yard touchdown with three minutes remaining . The Broncos added a two point conversion and another field goal to go ahead 23 13 .Pittsburgh responded with a field goal in the final minute to pull within seven points but they were unable to gain possession of the ensuing onside kick .The top seeded Broncos , who earned a bye through last week s wild card round , will face the New England Patriots next week in what will be the fifth playoff encounter , and 17th all time , between Manning and fellow quarterback Tom Brady .Cam Newton and the top seeded Carolina Panthers repelled a spirited second half surge by their nemesis team , the Seattle Seahawks , for a 31 24 victory on Sunday to reach their first NFC championship since the 2005 season .Carolina appeared to have the game sewn up after they came out firing with two touchdowns a little over three minutes into the contest en route to a commanding 31 0 halftime lead .But Seattle , the two time defending NFC champions who beat Carolina at this stage last year , got to within seven points with about a minute to play after Steven Hauschka followed three Russell Wilson touchdown passes with a field goal .The ensuing onside kick attempt by Seattle was recovered by Carolina and the Panthers were then able to run out the clock .Man , it was really excruciating to watch , Newton said about the final minutes of the game . It was a tale of two halves and we ve got to be better than that .With the win , Carolina will host the second seed Arizona Cardinals next Sunday to determine which team represents the National Football Conference at the February 7th Super Bowl . 	 0

PALO ALTO , CA Alzheimer ' s researchers at Stanford University published a study this week showing that the degenerative brain disease is beginning to affect the baby boomer generation , causing many to remember the 1960s even less accurately than they normally would ." We ' re seeing men and women who have spent so much of their lives misremembering the past grow even more detached from reality , " said neuroanatomist Dr Arthur Rothensen , who conducted the study . " This terrible disease has made thousands of boomers ' memories of the 1960s almost completely unreliable and fragmented . And we ' re talking about people who , even before they contracted Alzheimer ' s , believed they single handedly ended the war in Vietnam . "Added Rothensen , " It ' s just sad , really . "The study , which surveyed more than 1 , 500 baby boomers , found that Alzheimer ' s disease had a noticeable effect on those already suffering from " selective memory loss , " and only added to the unrealistic and often romanticized nature of personal accounts from the time period .Among the survey ' s participants , those who for decades had misremembered the ' 60s as a rose colored utopia in which everything and anything was possible were 38 percent less likely to accurately recall the past ." Dad always used to exaggerate his experience of the 1960s , but now he ' s totally gone , " said Dylan Finster , who recently moved his father Harold into managed care . " It was bad enough when he would go on and on about being at Woodstock , and how it completely changed the world for the better . But these days , not only did Woodstock change the world , he was also airlifted out of Hanoi with Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , and Jefferson Airplane in 1969 . "" I miss those old , innocent lies , " Finster continued .According to the Stanford study , the growing dementia of Harold Finster is not uncommon . In fact , the ability of baby boomers to remember the more negative aspects of the ' 60s , such as the infighting among many activist movements , the inherent sexism behind free love attitudes of the day , and the dangerous blurring of lines between harmless experimentation and full blown drug abuse , almost always grew worse after diagnosis with the degenerative brain disease ." I was washing dishes at Alice ' s Restaurant when Lt . William Calley ran in and shot Bobby McGee Kennedy right there in front of me , " said 66 year old Jacob Schwartz , a participant in the study who suffers from Alzheimer ' s . " It was the hottest Summer of Love on record , which was probably why all the blacks were playing in the fire hoses . They were having such a good time ! We all were ! "" I remember when Marvin Gaye sang that ' I Have A Dream ' song in Washington , D . C . , " 63 year old participant Shirley Meneken said . " Everything was perfect after that . There were no more problems or disagreements after that song . Everything was so good and perfect ! And we were there ! We did it ! Nobody felt any disillusionment years later . "In addition to mixing fact with fiction , confusing progressive action with being stoned out of their minds , and holding onto impossibly positive recollections of what was in reality a very complicated time , a majority of baby boomers in the study also misremembered the decades that followed ." Zero of 1 , 500 subjects admitted to remembering anything about the disco malaise of the 1970s , the surface level materialism of the 1980s , or the overindulgent parenting of the 1990s , " Alzheimer ' s Research Center director Robert Feinmann said . " It ' s almost as if those memories are too painful to deal with , either because they ' re ashamed of them or because they ' re so unbelievably lame . Either way , to most boomers , it ' s like those times happened to someone else . "" Essentially , we ' re dealing with a group whose values have always been malleable they rebelled against a ' greatest generation ' of war winning parents whom they now worship , they always claimed to have changed society by refusing to participate in it and even claimed they invented rock and roll , " Feinmann continued . " Yes , Alzheimer ' s may be loosening their grip on reality , but we ' re not sure how firm it was to begin with . " 	 1

jason creel of deth knell says he had an epiphany three years ago in a little rock motel and since then his relationship with satan, the embodiment of all evil in the world, has never been the same. " let me put it this way, " he said while sitting down for a coffee outside the orbit room in toronto, where his band will be shaking the rafters tonight. " whereas before satan was just kind of an idea to me, an abstraction, maybe a bit of a marketing ploy, now he's quite real and, frankly, gunning for me. i'm in his sights. " creel says his awakening to the torments of hell that await him after this life came after he and some fans trashed his motel room in little rock. police were called, but luckily one of the two officers that showed up was familiar with the band and the other was a big metallica fan, although he hadn't heard of creel's band. but, in any case, the officers told the motel manager and the band to work it out among themselves. " so we agreed to pay the cost of fixing the place back up, and it was steep, like, 4. 000, or something, " said creel. " that night i took a long, hard look at myself in the mirror and that's when i saw him. " that " him, " says creel, was satan. " he was staring right at me. i mean, it was effing blood curdling. i've been singing about this guy for years but when i finally met him face to face, it was like,'i don't really know you, do i?'" creel says satan doesn't look at all like what you think of, if you think of him as a red guy with a little beard and horns. instead, he looks a lot like creel himself. " looked just like me, " said creel. " not that i'm the satan or anything like that, but that i think he must reflect you back or channel your image or something. and that's what makes it so scary. " so, has that night three years ago changed what deth knell sings about? " oh, no, our fans would never tolerate that, " said creel. " i mean, we are the channelers of satan. for us to start singing about, i don't know, bambi or something, would just not fly. so, we are still satan's messengers, as we've always been. " even so, creel says he has started to do some good deeds on the side just small things when the band's not playing. " this isn't to try to get into god's good graces or anything like that, " creel said. " i don't pretend that god is suddenly going to say,'oh, jason, i see you're really a good person, so i'll protect you from that evil satan.'but i figure it can't hurt, you know? i mean, it's not like i'm going to make satan mad and he's going to say,'buttering up mr good, eh? well, two infinities of hell for you!'what's the difference if it's one infinity or two infinities? it's never ending either way. so, to me, i have something to gain and nothing to lose. " creel says he gave a free ticket to tonight's deth knell show to a guy from chicago he met yesterday at a bar in downtown toronto who had lost both his legs in afghanistan. " he took an ied from the taliban, " said creel. " how crappy is that? so i said, " dude, come to our show tonight. he probably won't make it, though. not that much fun if you're in a wheelchair. but it's a little thing that i could do to help this guy who has suffered so much. " again, " creel continued, " it's not like i expect god to change his mind about me. " but if, over time, i can cut my stay in the fires of hell from infinity to, say, one million years, that's something. for sure, a million years sounds like a lot, but it's finite, and that's huge. that's very different than never ending. " finishing up his coffee, creel becomes introspective. " you know, for me, satan has always been about black t shirts and big crosses. it's never been about, like, descending into the nine rings of the underworld. but when you play with fire you risk getting burned, 	 1
AP McCoy has urged the nation to follow his Aintree dream as he chases the fairytale end to his extraordinary career .Retirement beckons for McCoy , champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997 , and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the 1million Crabbie ' s Grand National on Saturday .AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don ' t Push It in 2010Shutthefrontdoor , trained by Jonjo O ' Neill , will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once a year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don ' t Push It .In a perfect world , the National will finish with McCoy standing high in his irons celebrating but he , more than anyone , knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing . It won ' t , however , stop the 40 year old hoping his script has a glorious finale .' I ' m a dreamer , ' said McCoy , who announced his plans to retire in February . ' I ' m a believer I always have been .McCoy seeks to end record breaking career with victory on Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National' If everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will happen , I can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me . In some ways , I regret making the announcement to retire when I did . I ' ve thought to myself I should have just kept quiet . But in other ways I think it has been good .' If it ' s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport , so much the better .' Racing has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back , great . If people are putting money on Shutthefrontdoor in the hope I win for the fairytale , let me assure them nobody will be wanting me to win more than I do . People talk about me having ridden more winners than anyone else but I ' ve also ridden more losers than anyone else .A thank you message board to retiring jockey McCoy on display at Aintree' I ' ve had 19 goes at this race and won once , so that gives you an idea of what it is going to be like . 'The last time a horse carried such goodwill was when Frankel , trained by the late Sir Henry Cecil , won the Champions Stakes at Ascot in October 2012 .Mention of that brought a wry smile from McCoy .' I wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at Ascot ! ' he said . ' I ' ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way ! But , listen , I ' m a positive person and that is never going to change . Let ' s hope the dream can happen .

The celebrity chef Hugh Fernley Whittingstall has stirred up controversy with his latest stunt in his long running battle with cheap supermarket chicken .Hugh has been filmed on a recent visit to an aviation test facility , where he shoots a dead chicken from a specially designed " chicken gun " into a full size Jumbo jet engine , running at full speed .Many of his fans have written to express their outrage at this latest prank and bosses at the supermarket giant are said to be " stunned " .Hugh defended his actions , saying " The public may think that by firing a dead chicken into a jet engine , I am demonstrating little respect for these magnificent birds , " said Hugh . " But the thing is , these chickens were actually treated with even less respect throughout their sorry lives . " He added . " I am doing this to highlight the general lack of respect bestowed upon chickens in our country that are raised under ' Standard ' conditions " .The film shows Hugh unwrapping a supermarket chicken and loading it into a giant gun . He then pulls the trigger and the chicken is ejected at a speed of around 180mph into the spinning blades of a Rolls Royce jet engine .The test known as " the chicken ingestion test " is standard practice in the aviation industry to check the results of bird strikes on jet engines . When we contacted a spokesperson from the industry they were keen to point out that they normally use free range or organic chickens in the test and do not condone the purchase of Standard chickens .Standard chickens are reared in accordance with the EU " Standard Chicken " regulations , which allow for birds to be permanently chained up in tiny cages and periodically tortured by farmers .The controversial chef shot to fame with his TV series " River Cottage " where he demonstrates his eccentricity by eating freshly grown organic food .Time will tell however whether his latest antics will back fire . 	 1
( Health . com ) Study after study has linked long work hours , demanding bosses , and other on the job stressors to health problems ranging from insomnia to heart attacks . But the jobs themselves may not be entirely to blame .According to a new study of Swedish twins , the relationship between job stress and health problems is influenced in part by differences in personality and temperament , such as how optimistic , confident or self critical a person is . And these traits are in turn closely related to genetic makeup .The researchers analyzed data from about 300 pairs of fraternal and ( genetically ) identical twins , many of whom did not grow up together . The various combinations of shared genes and upbringings allowed the researchers to parse the connections between genes and environment , job satisfaction and stress , and physical health .Health . com : Job killing you ? 8 types of work related stressAfter crunching the numbers , they made two initial conclusions : personality type is associated with job stress and health , and a large portion of the differences in personality type nearly 45 can be attributed to genes .Taking the analysis one step further , the researchers estimate that genetic effects are responsible for 32 of the person to person variance in job stress , 35 of the variance in job satisfaction and 47 of the variance in health problems .The upshot ? The path between job stress and poor health runs at least partly through our genes and personality ." We ' re not saying job stress makes no difference , or there aren ' t things that cause stress , " says lead author Timothy Judge , a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend , Indiana . " But we can ' t have a concept . . . that life would be better if we just changed jobs . "Health . com : 10 careers with high rates of depressionThe findings , which were published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , seem to suggest a new twist on the old nature versus nurture question : What ' s more important for stress , the day to day work environment ( the " nurture " side , in this case ) or the inborn personality of the employee ?The question may not be so clear cut , says Carol A . Prescott , a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .In twin studies , Prescott says , it can be difficult to separate the shared environment whether that ' s a childhood home or the workplace from non shared environmental factors , such as " random events , " luck , and personal choices ." Non shared environment is by far the largest component for most behavioral outcomes , " Prescott says .Judge and his colleagues did try to distinguish between shared and non shared factors . In addition to noting whether the twins grew up together , they also controlled for education and job characteristics ( such as a hazardous workplace ) . Still , they acknowledge that " idiosyncratic " differences in non shared environment are hard to pin down .Health . com : How your job can hurt your heartAlthough much gray area remains , the new study raises the possibility that previous research on the link between job stress and health woes may be providing an incomplete picture .Epidemiological studies , which look for broad trends in large populations of people , often don ' t account for genes or temperament factors that can affect a person ' s experience of job stress , as well as how they describe it in questionnaires , Judge says ." What if the very people who report they ' re really stressed are the very people who also report or actually have health problems ? " Judge says . " We showed that a big part of the relationship between the two is genetic . "Health . com : Stressed ? 7 steps to instant calmSimon Rego , an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , says it ' s important to remember that genes , though influential , don ' t control us .Someone who ' s genetically more vulnerable to workplace stress won ' t necessarily get stressed out . In fact , Rego says , stress often arises when our temperament and our environment clash . " We look at the interaction between predisposition and some sort of stressor to really activate someone ' s vulnerability , " he says .If you are predisposed to stress due to your genes , life experiences , or some combination of the two the good news is there are steps you can take to fight back .Talk therapy , for instance , can help people recognize the situations that cause them stress and learn coping strategies , Rego says .The vicious physiology of stressCopyright Health Magazine 2011 	 0

' systematic failure': his honour judge nicholas marston found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her libertya judge has condemned a council which unlawfully took an autistic 19 year old woman into care for more than a year and banned her parents from seeing her alone. lawyers acting for the family from yeovil, somerset, accused the council of committing'one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty'ever seen by a court. the disabled woman known only as p was supposed to go into respite care with somerset county council for just two weeks while her parents went on a break. the young woman, who cannot speak, had injured herself at school three days earlier and her worried mother had alerted respite staff to self inflicted bruising on her chest. but with her family out of the country, staff concluded the injury had been caused by'someone or something other than herself'and decided to take her into care. her desperate parents were then banned from unsupervised contact with her and forced to battle for 14 months to get her released. a judge at the court of protection has now criticised the council and ruled it acted unlawfully. the council has apologised but the couple are suing them for damages. the court heard how p was on a residential school placement before the separation, but had regular contact with her family. while on a school trip in may 2013 she was in an'extremely distressed condition'after staff saw her'breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area '. she displayed behaviour described as'severely challenging behaviour'and had to be restrained by staff and taken home early. her mother noticed bruising on her chest and, after consulting her gp, took her to an arranged respite placement in yeovil three days after the school incident. illegal move : lawyers acting for the family from yeovil accused somerset county council ( whose headquarters are pictured ) of committing'one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty'ever seen by a courtdespite alerting respite staff to the bruises, the teenager was taken to yeovil district hospital within days, but staff declined to tell the doctor dr k about her previous incident at school. as a result somerset county council was called in and they decided to take p into full time care. her parents returned from holiday to hear of the decision in their absence. but after a nine day trial earlier this year, his honour judge nicholas marston found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her liberty. he said the lack of a'proper investigation'showed a'systematic failure'by the authority. he said :'the doctor's report said " the bruising is felt to be comparable with a blow or blows to p's anterior chest with a significant force or fall onto an object.'" this would be an unusual injury pattern to have been self inflicted but if this was the case then it would be expected that such self harm, which would have been demonstrably significant and painful, would have been witnessed ".'these are very significant words given that members of staff at the school had observed previously p breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area.'this information was easily available but was never passed onto dr k nor was further information that on the class trip p had displayed severely challenging behaviour pulling hair, kicking seats and that staff on that trip had been " taken to the ground " by p and she had had to be restrained in the approved holds for physical restraint on the trip.'instead, at a strategy meeting, as a result of the conclusions of the medical report that it was " highly likely that p has received a significant injury from someone or something other than herself.... " so instead it was decided she would not be returned to her mother.'a spokesman for the family's lawyers said p was now back at the family home and'settling in well '. she said :'the council did not take account of several possible explanations for the cause of the bruising, not least the fact that she had been observed hitting herself in that area and that she had also taken a member of staff to ground whilst out on a school trip.'crucially, the young woman herself was not given the opportunity to explain how the bruising had occurred.'she added :'in delivering his judgement that the council had unlawfully deprived p of her liberty, his honour judge marston criticised the council for its systemic failure, its corporate failings and its misguided philosophies.'the council continued to pursue an unsubstantiated case against the family, and unreasonably refused to drop allegations made against them.'somerset county council said it accepted the judge's ruling and comments. a spokesman said :'we were completely motivated by serious concern for the young lady's welfare.'we have apologised 	 0
BRENTWOOD , California Maria Shriver is still extremely upset at the fact that her soon to be ex husband Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a child out of wedlock with their long time housekeeper .Maria , whose mother Eunice is a Massachusetts Kennedy , reportedly mentioned to close friend Oprah Winfrey that he could ' ve at least had an affair with someone like actress Brigitte Nielsen .Well , Shriver soon learned when she read Arnold ' s book , Total Recall My Story of Loving , Lusting , and Lap Mingling that Arnie did in fact engage in some hokey pokey with the Danish star .She also learned that he had other high profile affairs with six famous Tinsel Town actresses including THE NAMES OF THE SIX ACTRESSES HAVE BEEN DELETED BY THE EDITOR .Maria decided to write her own book to address some of the lies she said were mentioned in Mr Schwarzenegger ' s book .Her 19 . 95 book is titled Lying Arnold My Book About My Cheating Husband Arnold Schwarzenegger ' s Book .In chapter seven , Maria writes how even after they were married , Arnold still put up photos of male body builders all over the walls in their master bedroom , their kitchen , their game room , their bathrooms , and even in their guest rooms .She also pointed out that she once caught Arnie drinking one of his high protein power drinks out of a baby bottle .And the day that he confessed to her that he had gotten their maid pregnant 14 years before , he showed her a brand new tattoo that he had just gotten on his back that read Charlie Sheen .SIDENOTE : Maria was asked if the rumor about her and Russell Brand being spotted holding hands and feeding each other pink cotton candy on the Santa Monica Pier last week was true .

WASHINGTON Following the completion of three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate , a nationwide Gallup tracking poll conducted this morning has found that all registered voters in the United States now consider themselves undecided in the upcoming election .According to the polling data , 100 percent of women , men , African Americans , Hispanics , small business owners , LGBT voters , seniors , Tea Party activists , and members of every other category surveyed fall into the undecided camp after witnessing the candidates from both the Democratic and Republican tickets face off on national television for a total of six hours ." Watching how these men conduct themselves in simple one on one exchanges made me completely unsure of what I ' m going to do when I receive my ballot and have to put a check next to one of their names , " undecided Florida voter Colleen Moynihan said . " In the first debate , Obama was either being timid or arrogant or both , so I had my doubts about him . And while Romney was more confident and engaged , I honestly felt like I couldn ' t trust much of anything he said . "" Really the only thing I can say for certain is that I don ' t want to hear anything else from either one of them ever again , " Moynihan added .In addition to not knowing whether they will support President Obama or Republican challenger Mitt Romney in November , U . S . voters also could not say who they believe is stronger on any given issue , with 0 percent of those polled stating that they could tell a difference between the two candidates on foreign policy following last night ' s debate ." Of that 100 percent who are now undecided , not even one person we surveyed said they were leaning even slightly toward Obama or Romney , " said Gallup editor in chief Frank Newport , himself an undecided voter residing in Princeton , NJ . " And that held true across all 50 states . So this election is really anyone ' s to win . Or no one ' s , I guess . "Moreover , Newport added that the more political pundits dissect the debate performances , revealing excruciating and generally unpleasant details about the " personal style " of each candidate , the more entrenched voter indecision becomes ." The undecided vote will be critical to the president ' s reelection , " said Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod , who admitted that he , too , is on the fence about who to vote for Nov . 6 . " He needs to show uncommitted voters such as myself that he can stop the partisan cheerleading and seriously address our concerns . "A follow up poll revealed that the one thing the entire electorate had decided on was that they were absolutely not voting for third party candidate Jill Stein . 	 1
Hollywood , California Last reported sighting of the 7 foot tall actor , Michael Smith , who originally played " Chewbacca " in the very popular " Star Wars " movie series ( episodes IV , V and VI ) , placed him driving down a winding country road somewhere deep in the back woods of the peach state of Georgia , where the body of an alleged " Bigfoot " was recently discovered by two hunters .On his way to make a special appearance as the lovable space ferrying fur ball for a surprise birthday party for a close family friend ' s sick child Only , Smith never arrived .Smith ' s abandoned car was found by the local highway patrol parked a half mile or so down the road from his friend ' s house ." Michael wouldn ' t just let a kid down like that , " said Carol Smith , his wife of 31 years . " He ' s a professional actor . "Although it is true that Smith has been out of work since George Lucas rapped up " Return of the Jedi " in 1981 , he was doing the birthday party as a favor to a friend , insisted Mrs Smith . Despite their expectations of turning the appearance into a regular part time gig , picking up some sorely needed money on the side to supplement their fixed retirement income ." He so looked forward to attending the birthday party as ' Chewbacca , " said Mrs Smith . " He was finally ready to face his inner demon , once again reprising his role as what he endearingly referred to as the ' Space Monkey ' that made him famous , forever typecasting him to cast directors as the ape man , destroying his budding acting career . "" Tracks leading away from the back of the vehicle indicate that Smith removed something from the trunk before proceeding in the direction of his friend ' s house , " said Officer Paul Johnson of the Georgian Highway Patrol .Officer Johnson believes that Smith must have pulled his car over to the side of the road , parking it far away enough so the children arriving at the birthday close would not see him get dressed into his ' Chewbacca ' costume , but still close enough for him to walk the distance to the house , allowing him to surprise the children ." Large foot prints from the ' Chewbacca ' costume fortunately left deep impressions in the ground , making it easier to track where he went , " said Officer Johnson , as he pulled out a map of the region ." Now as we all know from the movie , ' The Fugitive , " continued Officer Johnson . " A man can cover only so much distance on foot , weather walking or running . So I world say that since Smith was not handcuffed or chained at the ankle and because his tracks suddenly disappear where we found a bloodied wooden club and all those empty jugs of Moon Shine that he has been kidnapped by Mountain Folk . Or what you call : ' Hillbillies . "" I know , Michael , " said an inconsolable Mrs Smith . " He would never disappoint a close family friend ' s sick child on their birthday or skip out on a paying gig . He would have made that appearance at that birthday party as if it were the last thing he ever did . Or died trying in the process . "Officer Johnson plans to form a search party and expand the parameter of the search area where the movie ' Deliverance ' was shot ." It ' s ironic , I know , " said Officer Johnson . " It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about it . " 	 1
Rodgers , Packers beat Vikings 30 13 to even NFC North raceMINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) The Green Bay Packers were in a funk , booed by their loyal fans the week before and passed by the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC North .Aaron Rodgers and the Packers responded with a resolute victory , fending off the Vikings like Clay Matthews waving his finger after tackling Adrian Peterson for a loss .Rodgers threw for a pair of touchdown passes without a turnover , Datone Jones had two of Green Bay ' s six sacks and Eddie Lacy contributed a season high 100 yards rushing to help the Packers beat the Vikings 30 13 on Sunday and stop a three game losing streak .' ' Maybe we ' ll get you guys off our back for a couple days , ' ' Rodgers said . ' ' We ' ve been taking it on the chin , rightfully so , the last three weeks after a couple real poor performances . This was an important week for us . We really stuck together . ' 'James Jones had six catches for 109 yards after several quiet games and Mason Crosby made all five of his field goal tries , lifting the Packers ( 7 3 ) to their 10th win over the Vikings in the last 11 meetings with Rodgers at quarterback . He has thrown for 28 touchdown passes with just three interceptions in those games .From Lacy to Crosby to the two time NFL MVP Rodgers , the underperforming Packers bounced back in a big way to post the highest score against the Vikings this season .' ' I think sometimes we play a little better when we start to get questioned , ' ' said Rodgers , who was a ho hum 16 for 34 for 212 yards but brilliant when he needed to be on third down scoring passes to Jones and Randall Cobb .The Vikings ( 7 3 ) had their five game winning streak shoved back in their face by a proud Packers team that clearly wasn ' t ready to concede a division it has won four straight times . The rematch is on Jan . 3 in Green Bay .' ' This team you saw play today , it wasn ' t us . We were out of sync , out of whack , ' ' said Peterson , who was held to 45 yards on 13 carries with one touchdown . He lost a fumble at the Packers 21 early in the fourth quarter .Teddy Bridgewater took back to back sacks to prompt a punt on the next possession , all but sealing the first loss by the Vikings at home in eight games since the Packers won here almost exactly a year ago .' ' We ' ve got to fix this . You ' ve got to be able to win when the whole world is watching , ' ' cornerback Captain Munnerlyn said .Right after the ugliest of their three straight defeats , an 18 16 decision at home against Detroit , Rodgers and the Packers roared back with a vintage performance against the Vikings to the delight of the enemy fans chanting , ' ' Go , Pack , Go ! ' ' throughout the evening .' ' Sometimes you have to look in the mirror , especially with the losses we ' d had , ' ' Matthews said .The Packers used a 50 yard pass interference penalty on Terence Newman , who was covering Jeff Janis on third and 15 from the 15 , to set up the 10 yard touchdown toss by Rodgers to Cobb with 10 seconds left in the first half . An illegal contact call on Anthony Barr during a third down incompletion gave Rodgers yet another opportunity on that defining drive .On the first play of the fourth quarter , Rodgers rolled right on third and 9 and zinged the ball to Jones at the edge of the end zone for a 27 yard score on . He shoveled the 2 point conversion pass to Jones , too , for a 27 13 lead .After Rodgers attempted 61 passes against the Lions and came away with a sore shoulder , the Packers were determined to re establish Lacy and James Starks between the tackles .' ' This is the way we prefer to play , ' ' coach Mike McCarthy said .Bridgewater took quite a bruising , leaving the game briefly with an injury to his left shoulder but still finishing 25 for 37 for 296 yards and a touchdown without any turnovers . The Packers went without a sack on their entire three game losing streak .Peterson , the NFL ' s leading rusher who passed the 1 , 000 yard mark for a seventh season , averaged 116 yards over the first 15 times he played the Packers with four games of 150 plus yards .NOTES : Kyle Rudolph had a touchdown and a career high 106 yards receiving for the Vikings . . . .

Most of us haven ' t partied with the bunnies at " The Playboy Club , " or fought crime like " Charlie ' s Angels . " And with the NBC and ABC programs canceled after just a few episodes , we ' ll never have the chance .But in the time it took for one alphabet network drama to get the axe , another garnered 8 million viewers and a full season pickup .After all , " Revenge " is a language we all understand .The modern day " Count of Monte Cristo " reels audiences in with characters viewers seem to love and love to hate . Not to mention plot twists to die for . Still , the primetime soap doesn ' t venture into campy territory . Not even while playing with traded identities and crimes of passion .The concept is simple : Amanda Clarke , disguised as Emily Thorne , returns to the Hamptons to take revenge on the people who destroyed her family when she was a little girl .And " Revenge " couldn ' t have come at a better time as far as its network is concerned .With " Desperate Housewives ' " eighth and final season underway , ABC was fortunate to find a new female driven drama that so far appears to resonate with viewers . " Revenge " even has its own insightful narrator . ( Thank you , Mary Alice Young . You can go now . )" For the truly wronged , real satisfaction can only be found in one of two places : Absolute forgiveness or mortal vindication , " narrator and protagonist Emily Thorne , played by former " Brothers and Sisters ' " cast member Emily VanCamp , coos at the beginning of the pilot . Before even making the acquaintance of her victims , she ' s got the audience on her side .That ' s not to say everyone is a fan of her narration .With " Desperate Housewives " and " Grey ' s Anatomy " in mind , one HitFix reviewer wrote , " ABC has an in house style that says that having your female lead narrate nothingness at the start of every episode is a worthy strategy . "But whether you ' re a fan of Thorne ' s philosophical musings or not , the numbers don ' t lie . About 7 . 3 million viewers tuned in to " Revenge " on Thanksgiving Eve better known as the biggest bar night of the year .Now nine episodes in , the series began in a predictable fashion with Emily targeting and conquering one victim every week . Each episode even ended with Emily marking a red X over the victim of the hour in a posed photograph of the Hamptons royalty ." Revenge " has since taken a more complex turn , with the introduction of new characters , telling flashbacks and plans gone awry a change welcomed by some critics ." The show has wisely realized that it needs to mix it up when it comes to ' revenging , ' and it ' s also fruitful to have plans backfire and have unexpected complications emerge , " AOL TV critic Maureen Ryan wrote in her column , " Stay Tuned . "One complication being antagonist Victoria Grayson , played brilliantly by Madeleine Stowe .Let ' s just say Emily isn ' t the only character seeking revenge .The perfect present day villain , Victoria is out to get her son ' s new love interest , her daughter ' s inept boy toy , her unfaithful husband and the frenemy who led him astray ." I can believe that this person would be doing these things , " Stowe told the Sioux City Journal . " It ' s easy for me to slide into her . "As if Stowe and VanCamp weren ' t enough of a sell , the show ' s portrayal of the Hamptons royalty might be ." We are dealing at a particular time right now in American history where I think the average American is going to want to see the takedown of the rich , " Stowe said .Nothing like a show about rich people who hate their lives to keep one entertained during a recession . 	 0
prime minister nuri al maliki gave up the fight thursday to keep his post, clearing the way for a new leader that many hope can hold iraq together as the country battles brutal extremist fighters. in a televised address, al maliki withdrew his candidacy for a third term and endorsed the prime minister designate, bringing to an end a political battle that just days ago saw him vow to hold onto power as he ordered tanks into the streets. " i announce to you today that i am withdrawing my candidacy in deference to my brother, haider al abadi, in the highest interest of the country, " he said. the news first flashed on state television follows mounting pressure, at home and abroad, for al maliki to step aside and make way for someone to bridge the sectarian divide that many accuse him of fomenting. the move comes at a critical time in iraq as sunni fighters with the so called islamic state, formerly known as the islamic state of iraq and syria, force hundreds of thousands from their homes as they seize large swaths of land. al maliki's announcement came the same day that u. s. president barack obama declared the isis siege that trapped thousands in the sinjar mountains over, but warned the crisis is far from solved. while humanitarian airdrops and u. s. airstrikes saved those stranded from starving and provided safe passage off out of the mountains, the yazidis arrived by the thousands at camps in and outside iraq. al maliki will continue to serve as the country's caretaker prime minister as well as its top military commander until al abadi forms a new government. al maliki's acquiescence was a turnaround for the man, who in recent days called the appointment of al abadi unconstitutional and said he would not step down. he had gone so far as to file a lawsuit in federal court to stop the formation of a new government and ordered tanks and soldiers loyal to him into the streets of baghdad, raising concerns of a possible coup. but with world leaders, diplomats, members of his own political party and the country's most revered shiite cleric pressuring him to step down, al maliki gave up the fight. calling it in an " honorable decision " by al maliki, u. s. secretary of state john kerry urged al abadi to move quickly to form the government, saying it is essential to pulling the country's various ethnic and religious groups together to fight a common enemy in isis. who's haider al abadi, the man who will lead iraq? while iraq works to seat a new government, obama said in a televised address on thursday that the united states will continue to conduct airstrikes to protect u. s. personnel and facilities. the united states carried out airstrikes thursday against three isis targets northeast of the kurdish regional capital of irbil, according to the u. s. central command. the targets were u. s. manufactured mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, more commonly known as mraps, and other armored vehicles being driven by isis fighters. the vehicles are believed to have been seized by isis after it routed iraqi troops in northern iraq. also, there were reports that isis fighters were advancing south and west of kirkuk, about 240 kilometers ( 149 miles ) north of baghdad. at the same time, obama urged iraq's shiite dominated government to seize " the enormous opportunity of forming a new inclusive government " under al abadi. " he still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction, " he said. the new battleground in iraq appeared to be spreading to the south and west of kirkuk, where isis fighters occupied four towns to the south and west of kirkuk, according to hisham al hashimi, a researcher at the journalistic freedom observatory. according to his sources in the field, there was fighting ongoing between isis and kurdish fighters, known as peshmerga, in the town of tuz khurmatu. the town is home to a number of turkmen, an ethnic minority in iraq. the united nations estimates that more than 400, 000 people have been driven from their homes since june, when isis swept across the border from syria into iraq. of those displaced, more than 200, 000 have poured into northern dohuk province in recent weeks, where refugee camp populations have swelled since isis began its assault against yazidis, christians, kurds and shiites. thousands of other refugees sought protection inside the northern kurdish region of iraq. " to be blunt, we don't have housing for all of them. we don't have shelter, " a spokesman for the u. n. human rights commissioner, edward colt, said at a camp near the peshkhabour bridge where iraqis are entering the area. " thousands of tents are being erected as we speak. 	 0
US Special Forces were closing in on Osama Bin Laden last night , after intercepting an injudicious message from the terror chief on social networking website Twitter ." OBL2001 is . . . relaxing at his favourite cave in good old Tora Bora . You know the one with minimal security that is exactly 50 kilometres due West of the Khyber Pass . Praise Allah ! " the message read prompting a team of crack soldiers to move into the mountains from their base in Kabul .Pentagon officials are certain it is genuine having " followed " the mysterious OBL2001 on the Twitter site for some months although this is the first time they have managed to pinpoint his exact location ." We were very excited back at the end of last year when we first came across this individual through our covert operatives in the " Al Qaeda 4eva " Facebook group , " said CIA spokesman Bob Dawson . " Unfortunately , most of his messages contained nothing but trivial musings on the minutiae of life as a homicidal , middle aged lunatic , such as :OBL2001 is . . . tired after stoning all those infidel pigs . Getting too old for this !andOBL2001 is . . . worried his beard is getting a bit thin : (" He spent most of last week posting endless inane ramblings about some ' brazen harlot ' who rejected his advances back in Saudi Arabia when he first went on the run , but he was always clever enough to stay vague on the whereabouts of his various hideouts or indeed the torture chamber where he had the poor girl lashed for showing her ankles at the market place . "However , Dawson now thinks they have finally traced the man who has been top of the FBI Most Wanted list for the last decade ." Our spy satellites have confirmed there has been recent activity outside a cave network at the co ordinates described in the message so unless this is an elaborate hoax like that time we followed a lead from Chemical Ali ' s MySpace page and lost dozens of highly trained marines in a booby trapped warehouse just outside Fallujah then I reckon we ' re in business .

It was after those Atlantic City bankruptcies . I heard they couldn ' t find him . There were rumors he had committed suicide , and his double was taking over from him to keep all the real estate together . It was a tax planning thing . "" How was it he got buried in East Clairborne . " I asked ." It was top secret . We ' re as inconspicuous as it can get . Now he ' s got his left leg in the ground and the rest of him is out . He ' s upset this double up there is stealing his thunder and he ' s out to get him . He says this clown is making him look bad . I been watching him get out . First , I saw his head about two months ago , then his neck , and then the upper part of the body . At this rate , he ' ll be out in a week . God help his double when the Donald get him .

Sergio Aguero was booked for diving in the opening stages of Manchester City ' s trip to Southampton , despite Saints defender Jose Fonte making clear contact with him inside the penalty area .Referee Mike Jones booked the Argentine despite the appeal from City players , and the visitors had a right to feel aggrieved .Here , Sportsmail ' s resident refereeing expert Graham Poll gives his view on the decision .Jose Fonte makes clear contact with Sergio Aguero as the Argentine falls to the ground inside the boxJones books Aguero as City players go to remonstrate with the official with Aguero pleading his innocenceJamie Carragher said on Sky Sports at half time : ' That could be one of the worst decision I have seen this season . How has he the referee missed that ? 'Mike Jones , often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees , made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed Jose Fonte wipe Sergio Aguero out for a stonewall penalty .As if that was not bad enough Jones then rubbed salt in the wound by showing Aguerro a yellow card for diving ! However , Manchester City won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that Jones made such a blatant mistake after all he is human ? Well I think it does .Firstly Aguero has a yellow card to his name that , however wrong , cannot be over turned . He could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions .Next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the Premier league statistics and be forever against Aguero ' s record .So why did Jones make such a basic error and can he improve ?His first decision of the game was a very good one but perhaps contributed to the error with the Aguero incident . When Victor Wanyama slid across Yaya Toure in just the seventh minute Jones , despite not having the best viewing angle , did not hesitate to give a free kick and caution the Southampton player .This was despite Wanyama ' s vehement denial that he had done anything wrong and had in fact played the ball . Other Southampton players pressurised Jones , querying his decision , perhaps hoping to influence the referee and get into his head early on . I think they succeeded .VIDEO Aguero is no cheat PellegriniAguero is clearly fouled inside the area by Fonte , but was booked for the dive inside the opening 10 minutesDespite replays proving that Jones was 100 per cent correct to both award the free kick and to caution Wanyama I think he doubted himself and so when called upon to make a big decision , a penalty kick , he got it wrong by doubting what he saw .Confidence is an important ingredient in good performances , whatever you are doing if you are refereeing at the top level it is vital .Jones ' confidence has always been fragile which perhaps offers evidence as to why so many people question his ability to perform at this level . I question those who appoint him to such a high profile game , second versus third in the Premier League . 	 0
MEMPHIS , TN Officials from the National Weather Service issued a severe weather alert for all basements in Tennessee Tuesday after a deadly new weather phenomenon ravaged scores of residential downstairs areas , leaving every other part of the houses completely untouched . The recently discovered targeted cyclones , known as basement tornadoes , tore through cellars all over the state , killing dozens and injuring hundreds .Calling the recent devastation the worst indoor weather event in U . S . history , weather service director Dr John L . Hayes said that millions of residents who have for years been taught to seek shelter from twisters by taking refuge in their homes will have to drastically adjust long held assumptions about tornado safety and preparedness ." If there is a violently rotating column of air in your basement , do not go downstairs , " Hayes said . " Wait in an attic or at the top of a stairwell . If possible , find shelter in a structure lacking any kind of subterranean open space at all , such as a mobile home . "" Unless , of course , regular tornadoes are sighted in the area , in which case you should immediately get to your basement , provided you have one , " Hayes added .Meteorologists have measured the spiraling basement winds at speeds of up to 200 mph powerful enough in some cases to drive a box of dryer sheets six inches into solid concrete . In all , the cyclones have caused hundreds of dollars in property damage by toppling artificial Christmas trees , smashing jars of fruit preserves , and overturning ping pong tables ." Some people lost their entire basements , " said Knoxville area relief worker Dan Weiss , who personally observed a dozen rec rooms that were completely destroyed , and a half dozen more that might have been destroyed , though it was difficult to say for sure . " Everything they had ever stored was suddenly lost . So much extra stuff gone to waste . "Using Doppler radar , interior satellites , and computer models , researchers have determined that basement tornadoes form when warm dank air collides with a cool dry draft , creating a significant drop in pressure , and causing wind velocity to increase and whirl in a vortex of dust , debris , and cobwebs . Predicting where and when a basement tornado will strike is challenging , however , because they seem to jump from cellar to cellar by traveling through sump pumps ." All we can say for certain is that unfinished basements are twice as likely to develop tornadoes , " said Allan Boyer , a controlled meteorogist at the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman , OK . " Also , when residents leave their washing machines and dryers running it creates the ideal environment for tornadoes , because of the extra spinningness it causes in the air . "The NSPC has developed a scale for ranking the intensity of basement tornadoes with the lowest rating , B0 , only causing mild shag carpet disturbances , and the highest , B5 , capable of destroying workbenches and water heaters . According to NSPC statistics , independent minded siblings between the ages of 16 and 19 who always want to be alone are most likely to be injured by basement tornadoes . The second highest at risk group is families huddling in basements waiting for normal tornadoes to pass .The outbreak of basement tornadoes has also raised a slew of privacy issues , pitting so called storm hunters against homeowners , since those who study the deadly new phenomenon say they must gain access to private residences to be able to set up their equipment and observe the storms . Angry residents have already forced dozens of researchers camping in their cellars out of their homes , and at least two have been shot at or violently assaulted for peering through basement windows .While the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the NWS have been working together to develop new nationwide evacuation guidelines , officials say it is a complicated process ." Even if a storm warning goes into effect hours before a tornado strikes , we caution citizens against attempting to flee the area in automobiles , since this will dramatically increase their chances of being severely injured or killed by car tornadoes , " FEMA administrator R . David Paulison said . " This could shape up to be the worst development in natural disasters since the 2003 spate of earthquakes that struck directly under doorways and large desks . " 	 1
Working from home has become a way of life for many employees .But when your home is 4 , 000 miles from the voters who put you in office , questions are going to be asked .Brian Riley insists he ' ll still be able to represent the people of Hadleigh in Suffolk when he moves to Raleigh in North Carolina .And , despite being an ocean and a four hour time difference away , the 71 year old will be entitled to keep claiming his annual allowance of 10 , 274 .The former banker , whose daughter is Sky Sports News presenter Kate Riley , is under pressure from leaders at Tory run Suffolk council to quit before March 20 so that a by election can coincide with the May 7 general election .Jet setter : Tory councillor Brian Riley ( centre ) will soon be moving to North Carolina but says he can still represent his constituents in Hadleigh , Suffolk from across the Atlantic OceanRound trip : Despite being an ocean and a four hour time difference away , the 71 year old will be entitled to keep claiming his annual allowance of 10 , 274But he is legally entitled to hold the seat until the next county council election in 2017 as long as he attends a meeting every six months . Candidates must live in the UK to stand .Despite having had the Conservative whip withdrawn by furious colleagues on Tuesday , Mr Riley has refused to back down .He claims modern technology and regular trips to the UK will allow him to stay in touch with his constituents .' I am moving to the USA but I shall be coming back to the UK every six or seven weeks to keep up with my council work , ' said Mr Riley , whose wife Alice , 66 , is American .' We are in the 21st century with emails and Skype and there are plenty of ways of keeping in touch with people in Hadleigh . It isn ' t a case of gathering around the parish pump any more . 'He confirmed he would resign his other seat on Babergh district council because it involved ' nitty gritty issues ' but would be able to continue as a county councillor because the role was ' more strategic ' .Mr Riley even said he would have time to help the campaign to get Hillary Clinton to the White House .The presidential election takes place next year meaning he will have even less time for his constituents if the former first lady is chosen as candidate for the Democrats .Councillor : The former banker ( pictured ) is legally entitled to hold the seat until the next county council election in 2017 as long as he attends a meeting every six monthsTory leader Mark Bee yesterday said his colleague had caused outrage .' If a councillor moves out of the county it looks like an awkward relationship but it beggars belief to be in the United States , ' he said .' We don ' t think it represents the spirit of being a locally elected representative . 'Labour opposition leader Sandy Martin said the situation was ' completely bonkers ' .He added : ' It is all very well saying he will use Skype but a lot of people don ' t like talking over the phone or by computer . 'John O ' Connell of the TaxPayers ' Alliance said the case highlighted the need to introduce a recall mechanism to allow voters to kick out absent councillors .' They hand over hard earned money to their councillors and rightly expect to get their money ' s worth when it comes to democratic representation , ' he added .Mr Riley , who worked for 28 years at Standard Chartered bank before becoming a business consultant , has been summoned to a meeting with Mr Bee where he is expected to come under pressure to resign .In August last year a Liberal Democrat councillor triggered uproar by taking a 180 , 000 a year job in Saudi Arabia , 4 , 000 miles from his ward in Hampshire , which paid a 13 , 000 allowance . 	 0

HOLLYWOOD When Ben Briley started off on his American Idol journey he was a good old boy from the Volunteer State of Tennessee .But by the time the producers , hair stylists , makeup artists , and wardrobe folks got through with him even his own family had a heck of a time recognizing him .Ben sang the Elton John song " Benny And The Jets " which is probably the first time a country boy has ever sang an Elton John song much less a show type tune like Ba ba ba Benny and The Jets .Everyone in the audience and everyone viewing at home could tell that the Southern boy , who normally wears his baseball cap backwards , was very uncomfortable in fact he looked as uncomfortable as Ann Coulter at a beauty pageant .And so it was really no surprise to anyone when Ben Briley ended up in the dreaded Bottom 3 along with Majesty Rose of North Carolina and Sam Woolf from Michigan .Majesty and Sam got sent back to safety . Ben had to sing hoping to get the judges save but everyone knows that it would not happen . The judges are saving the save for the very last week that they can use it .So when Ben was singing all of the talking going on between Harry " The Ragin ' Cajun " Connick , Jr . , Jennifer " La Tush " Lopez , and Keith " The Aussie " Urban was all just for show .They already knew before the show even started that no one would get the coveted save .SIDENOTE : During the results show , Harry performed two songs on stage . After the show was over , one of the contestants Jessica Meuse told Music Moments Magazine that Connick was sharp all the way through his performance . CJ Harris said that Harry sang out of tune from the first note to the last , and Ben Briley said that Mike Tyson could have probably played the piano better than Harry did . 	 1
Radamel Falcao is fit enough to withstand the rigours of the Barclays Premier League and is ready to give his all for Manchester United , according to his wife , Lorelei Taron .United manager Louis van Gaal ' s is becoming increasingly frustrated at not having his striker fully fit and that was evident at the weekend .Van Gaal said Falcao was in the squad for the match at Southampton on Monday ' in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest . 'Radamel Falcao ' s wife , Lorelei Taron , uploaded the above image of her husband training at Manchester UnitedLouis van Gaal had previously said that Falcao was only ready to play 20 minutes a game for UnitedFalcao ( centre ) made a substitute appearance in the 78th minute in United ' s last match against StokeBut the Colombia centre forward ' s wife Taron went on her Instagram account to pour scorn on Van Gaal ' s assertion .Alongside a picture of Falcao in United training attire the caption read simply : ' 100 ready to give everything ! ! ! 'Falcao has yet to discover the prodigious goalscoring touch he is renowned for , finding the net only once in seven appearances at United .He came on as a 78th minute substitute during their last match , the home victory over Stoke .But if Monday ' s game at St Mary ' s sees United ' s resurgence continue with their fifth consecutive win , they will move above Southampton and into third in the Premier League .However , if Falcao does play a part he will be up against the top flight ' s best defence .Southampton have conceded a measly 10 League goals , thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season .So Jose Fonte and Maya Yoshida are likely to be the centre halves against whom Falcao is likely to line up .And then Van Gaal will have a better idea of how ready the Colmbia star is . 	 0
Modern humans have developed a reputation for being somewhat destructive and keen to separate themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom .However , a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain is suggesting our ancient cousins , the Neanderthals , were more in tune with nature .Archaeologists have discovered evidence that Neanderthals regularly inhabited the Cave of Llenes , near Senterada in Catalonia , around 200 , 000 years ago but were not alone .The fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside Neanderthal campsThe remains of other canivores including cave bears , hyenas , leopards , wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there .While some of the bones may have been brought there by the Neanderthals themselves , it seems they were also sharing the cave with these other predators .Scratches on the walls and hibernations nests particularly indicate that cave bears spent a considerable amount of time there .Neanderthals , shown in the artist ' s impression above , may have lived alongside predators in a cave in SpainResearchers found several cave bear fossils , similar to the one above , along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside Neanderthals 200 , 000 years agoIt is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about Neanderthal behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co existed with .' The excavations have documented regular visits by groups Neanderthals , probably related to hunting animals living around the cave . 'The researchers discovered large numbers of stone tools made by Neanderthals and evidence of camps that were made close to the entrance of the cave .They also found the fossilised bones of Bonal tahr a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western Europe 100 , 000 years ago which appear to have been hunted by the Neanderthals .The researchers also found traces of other ungulates including deer , rhinos and megaloceros a giant species of deer that is now extinct .Neanderthals first emerged around 280 , 000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia , but they eventually died out 40 , 000 years ago .The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens .They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe .However , a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light . Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination .A 60 , 000 year old multi purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devicesA recent discovery by researchers at the Mus um National d ' Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them .They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44 , 000 years ago from mammoth bones .Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments .Cross hatched engravings found inside Gorham ' s Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art .DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak .Eight talons found at a 130 , 000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world ' s first jewellery , and may have been worn as a necklace .Recent research has also suggested that Neanderthals may also have used herbs to flavour their food .Neanderthals , like the one above , may well have been the world ' s first gourmet chefs and made jewellery 	 0
Wikipedia was back Thursday , a day after shutting down the website to protest anti piracy bills now in Congress .On the website early Thursday morning was the cryptic message : " Thank you for protecting Wikipedia . We ' re not done yet . "Clicking on that message takes a Wikipedia viewer to a thank you letter and instructions on how to continue fighting against anti piracy bills that critics say could amount to censorship ." Your voice was loud and strong , " the message said . " Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open Internet . "Wikipedia was among several websites to shut down Wednesday in protest of the bills .Instead of the usual encyclopedia articles , visitors to Wikipedia ' s English language site were greeted by a message about the decision to black out its Web page for an entire day .Why Wikipedia went down at midnightHowever , users were able to access Wikipedia on some smartphones .The site and several others went dark at midnight Tuesday others followed suit later in the day .The protest is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act bill , a piece of proposed legislation that is working its way through the Congress . A Senate committee approved a similar bill in May called the Protect IP Act , which is now pending before the full Senate .The controversy over SOPA and PIPA has turned into an all out war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley . Media companies have united in favor of the bills , while tech ' s power players are throwing their might into opposing them ." Both SOPA and PIPA are threats not just to the U . S . economy , and not just to all the jobs that this tech sector creates , but if they had existed , Steve Huffman and I could have never founded Reddit , " said Alexis Ohanian , who co founded the site . Millions visit Reddit to submit interesting links from websites , discuss them and vote on them , he said , calling it " sort of a democratic front page of the web . " Reddit also went dark Wednesday morning and was back Thursday .One member of Congress , Rep . Darrell Issa , R California , who opposes the bills , said the unprecedented blackouts had " turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren ' t used to being told no .

New Holland , OH Joe the Plumber , real name Samuel J . Wurzelbacher , of Holland , Ohio , competed against 18 contestants for a chance to become John McCain ' s new best talking point on the FOX Network ' s reality show " John McCain ' s My New BTP . "Joe was eliminated within the first half hour of Tuesday night ' s episode , leaving eight remaining contestants in his wake .Joe ( pronounced " Joe " ) was edited to be pretty much a generic " I hate taxes " everyman entity through the past five episodes .During his time on the show , Joe partied all night with Sarah Palin and other contestants in clubs and on a boat , played polo on a moose ' s back , posed for " sexy " roller coaster photos and was grilled by Internet gossip gurus Jackie Broyles and Dunlap to determine his level of " realness " . He was determined to be the second most " real " contestant .On Tuesday ' s episode , he competed in a mock game show , " I ( heart ) McCain , " answering trivia questions about McCain ' s achievements . He lost , when he could only name " being shot down in Vietnam " and " being tortured in Vietnam " .He won his qualifying round ( which was not televised ) and competed against two women in the final . He got one out of three questions correct , knowing that McCain was born in Panama and that he grew up at a military school he did not know the city of Marietta , Georgia declared John McCain ' s birthday a holiday ( in honor of Lockheed Marietta receiving a heavy lift airplane contract in place of Boeing ) or that McCain had five 79th birthday parties . Joe thought McCain had 10 parties .( Joe said it was kind of " creepy " that William Ayers , the man who won the best Talking Point contest , knew all of the McCain trivia ) .Ayers ' prize was the privilege of being vilified on national television 24 7 until Nov . 4 which should raise his national profile enough to allow him to sell a ghost written memoir for millions ( as have both McCain and Obama ) .If it ' s any consolation , none of the other contestants had anything mean to say , just well wishes and messages of love .Joe can be reached regarding book and movie deals , and guest appearances , through his new agent Jim Della Croce of The Press Office . 	 1
GAINESVILLE , FL Although dolphins have long been celebrated for their high intelligence and for appearing to have a complex language , a team of researchers at the University of Florida reported Monday that these traits are markedly less evident on dry land .According to study researchers , a group of 25 bottlenose dolphins removed from their holding tanks failed 11 exercises designed to test their basic cognitive abilities and reasoning skills ." The dolphins were incapable of recognizing and repeating simple gestures , " said study co author Dr Scott Lindell . " Their non verbal communications were limited to a rapid constriction and expansion of the blowhole , various incomprehensible fin motions , and heavy tremors while they lay prone on the lab table . "After capturing the dolphins from the ocean , Lindell and his colleagues tagged them and placed them under the intense , high wattage lights of a moisture proof lab . The researchers then administered an extensive battery of tests designed to measure everything from the dolphins ' self awareness to their aptitude for writing and reading comprehension ." Dolphins have a popular reputation for being excellent communicators , " Lindell said . " But our study group offered only three types of response to every question we posed : a nonsensical , labored wheezing , an earsplitting barrage of unintelligible high pitched shrieks , and in extreme cases , a shrill , distressed scream . "Even the dolphins ' proven ability to navigate through a form of sonar called echolocation was ineffective on land ." The military has claimed great success in training these mammals , utilizing their echolocation skills to detect mines that have been placed underwater , " said Lindell , who conducted a similar experiment in a concrete parking lot . " We were unable to replicate this finding ourselves . "Lindell added : " In most cases , the dolphins succeeded in finding land mines only when we placed them directly on top of the mines . "In another test , several pounds of mackerel were placed on the ground , separated from the test dolphins by only 20 feet of concrete . The dolphins were unable to reach the food and feed themselves .Despite their failures in the initial series of tests , the animals were given further opportunities to demonstrate their intelligence on land . The dolphins were unable to display novel behaviors , use a map to pinpoint their location on campus ( spatial reasoning ) , or complete a simple obstacle course and wall climb ." Their learning curve was actually negative , " Lindell said . " The more time we gave them to complete basic land based tests , the more pitiful their efforts became , with many of them opting to bask in the sun rather than perform a simple task . "" In some cases , " Lindell added , " the dolphins appeared to be looking directly into our eyes , as if pleading with us to help them perform better in these tests . "Many scientists believe these findings may help to explain why dolphins , for all their vaunted intelligence , have never developed technology or agriculture , or harnessed the power of fire skills still exclusively in the domain of Homo sapiens .Said Lindell : " Their failure is a great disappointment to all of us who once felt an intelligence based kinship with these majestic animals .

Is your libido flagging ? If so , then a lack of sleep may be the reason why , researchers claim .A study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day .The amount of shut eye also affects how aroused they will become .The study , involving 171 women , showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent .Poor sex drive ? Getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido , new research has shownSleep was also important for genital arousal , according to the research , published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .Specifically , women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep .' The influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field , ' said Dr David Kalmbach , of the University of Michigan .' But these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women .He added : ' I think the take home message should not be that more sleep is better , but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs . 'And it ' s not just women previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone , which results in a lack of sex drive .Experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men , including reduced libido and poor reproduction .They can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density , leading to low energy levels , poor concentration and fatigue .Low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease , stroke , and type 2 diabetes .Scientists from the University of Chicago found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night ' s rest .The study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent and increased levels of arousalTheir study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older .' Low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour , which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss , ' said Professor Eve Van Cauter , who led the study .Other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels .An estimated one in four British women doesn ' t get enough iron from their diet , and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging , says Dr Radha Modgil , a GP in West London with a special interest in sexual health .' Low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy , ' she explains . ' If you ' re exhausted , sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing . '' The best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak , ' adds dietitian Helen Bond .' Red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood . 'Other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels . Dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good , easy absorbed form of iron' Red meat is also a good source of B vitamins , which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy .It ' s also a rich source of zinc , important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone , which women also need for sexual desire . Other good sources of zinc include beans , nuts and oysters . 'Eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive , says Helen Bond .' Foods such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps , which mean you won ' t have the energy for sex , ' she adds .Too much sugar also makes you fat , raising the level of oestrogen in the body , in turn reducing testosterone levels in men , says gynaecologist Peter Bowen Simpkins ,' If you ' re obese , you feel less attractive . You also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs . ' 	 0
PALM BEACH , FL A singer who impersonates Britney Spears has sued a Florida clinic over the results of her plastic surgery , which was " outsourced " to a physician in Bangladesh .Maylons Fuller , 37 , told reporters she had signed up for surgery at Fresh Horizons clinic in Palm Beach because she was older than the real Spears and " needed work " to carry on with her career ." But I came out looking like this , I can no longer do my act , so I have filed suit in Federal District Court , " she said , disrobing and turning slowly for the cameras . As a result of her surgery , the former Spears impressionist now bears an uncanny resemblance to country singer Dolly Parton , both above and below the neck .Fresh Horizons director Frederick Jones denied culpability , saying the " dramatic changes " in the patient ' s appearance resulted from an " act of God , " as defined in his contract with Fuller .He acknowledged in an interview he has cut costs and increased profits by " outsourcing " surgery to a physician in Bangladesh , using an international telephone hookup , and a fiber optic TV endoscope and remote control scalpel ." Watching a TV screen , using remote control dials and joystick , the surgeon can operate without ever touching the patient , " said Jones . " The surgeon can be thousands of miles away , and only a technician need attend the patient in person . Our highly qualified surgeon in Dacca , Dr Rabi Shoulahbi , charges one 120th of the going U . S . rate . "During Fuller ' s surgery , a windstorm Jones ' " Act of God " kept cutting the electricity and interfered with the TV picture of Miss Fuller on which Shoulahbi was relying . When the picture was down entirely , for some 20 minutes , Shoulahbi had to operate " on instruments " like a pilot flying in fog , Jones said . In those vital minutes , Shoulahbi used a Dolly Parton poster as a model because it was pinned to his door and he had no detailed life size photo of Spears ."

" i was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of prague and every time i arrive in prague, even now, i'm still amazed. the lighting at night the incredible architecture the details the history there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. it was a very special experience. the following time i went to prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and i was traveling once, twice a week from my town to prague. i would wake up at 5. 45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. after school i would take a five hour train to prague. so it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent. petra nemcova : prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. some people call it the " golden city, " some people say it's the heart of europe although maybe the french don't like that very much! paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and prague is smaller and has more of a village y feeling compared to paris. prague has more of a calming vibe. it's not rush rush rush. i think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of prague and also the vivid colors. i think they may imagine prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. but since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. before prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty. in five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful. petra nemcova : growing up in the czech republic at the time czechoslovakia was a beautiful childhood because i didn't understand the whole concept of communism. i was only 11 when communism fell down and when the velvet revolution happened. i had a really beautiful childhood... i didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. but our parents gave us something more valuable than money they gave us so much love and that's priceless. we didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. so we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and i loved it. so that made us richer. it also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. and the values you learn there are priceless too. you don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature. and the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. having a clementine for christmas it was an incredible joy and every time i smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood. but it was harder for my parents. because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. my parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble. petra nemcova : i lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, i was drowning many times throughout the experience. there were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. that's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time. petra nemcova : happy hearts is a foundation that i established after the tsunami. it helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. we build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. the education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. we help over 23, 000 children a year. we give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. the schools elevate the whole community. after the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of 	 0

One man ' s journey with the opposite sex finally arrived at a fresh new destination , of course , we are talking with reference to one particular gentleman we interviewed not more than 4 minutes and 32 seconds ago Herbert Humphrey Humbledick .' Herb ' was an average guy , not too dissimilar to anyone else , some might even say he ' s learnt the hard way , some might say he ' s just plain stupid , some even might say he ' s got his pants on back to front , who knows , Herbert tells us his emotional story here" When I was 14 and a half , I hoped that one day I would have a real girlfriend . When I was 16 I got one , but there was no passion , so I decided I needed a passionate girl with a buzz for life . "" In college I dated a passionate girl , but she was far too emotional . Everything was like an emergency she was a drama queen , cried all the time and threatened suicide , even pissed herself once . So I decided I needed a girl with some stability ." When I was 25 and a quarter I found a very stable girl but she was dull . She was predictable and never got excited about anything . "Life became so boring that Herb decided he needed a girl with some excitement ." When I was 28 I found an exciting girl , but I couldn ' t keep up with her she rushed from one thing to another , never settling on or finishing anything . She did mad impetuous things and made me sad as often as happy . She was great fun initially and very energetic , but directionless . So I decided to find a girl with some ambition ." When I turned 30 , I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her ." She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned . "Herbert , older and wiser than at the start of the interview , is now looking for a girl with big tits .Any interested readers should mark their post with their cup size . 	 1
NEW YORK Dan Marino , the former Dolphins quarterback , former multiple NFL all time record holder , and current co host of HBO ' s Inside The NFL , was the host , producer , and head writer of the hour long HBO special Mr 278 , which aired Monday and commemorates Brett Favre breaking the all time record for interceptions ." Join me in saluting Brett Favre for breaking the all time interception record of 277 set by George Blanda truly a milestone for the ages , " Marino intoned during the opening montage , which featured Favre throwing some of his most memorable picks . " Some say records were made to be broken personally , I ' ve never believed that but in any case the career interception mark was believed to be unreachable . It takes a player with an unusual combination of not knowing when to retire , not knowing when to stop trying to rack up the completions , and not knowing when to stop trying to throw touchdowns . And it seems that lucky player is everyone ' s big hero quarterback , Brett Favre . "" I once held all the major records , but I never came close on interceptions , " Marino added . " Also , I want to make it clear that I still have the records for passing yards in a season and in a career , but I have to hand it to Brett : He is now the interception record holder . Congratulations there , buddy . "Marino began work on Mr 278 late in the 2006 season , when it became apparent that Favre was on pace to break Blanda ' s interception record , as well as Marino ' s for touchdown passes , sometime in the 2007 season . When HBO producers balked at the idea of expanding their original planned 30 second supporting segment , Marino offered to work the show without pay and secured advertising commitments from NutriSystem , Papa John ' s Pizza , and Isotoner gloves ." I played in the NFL for many good years , which is why I set records for attempts , completions , and total seasons with 3 , 000 yards passing , " Marino ' s voice can be heard to say as an on screen graphic displayed the dozens of defensive players who had intercepted a Favre pass . " I even set a record for consecutive 3 , 000 yard seasons . Brett Favre has broken all of those , largely since he decided not to retire yet . And now , he has one of the most memorable records of all : interceptions . "Marino then interviewed more than 30 current and former NFL players who had participated in Favre ' s record interception streak , including Brain Urlacher , Deion Sanders , Troy Vincent , and John Lynch . Marino devoted special attention to Sean Taylor , who was on the receiving end of Favre ' s record breaking 278th interception , an ill advised downfield sideline attempt thrown off the back foot , which Taylor neatly high pointed .Marino also interviewed players who had intercepted Favre passes in college , during Favre ' s high school career in Mississippi , and during Packers training camp . In one poignant segment , Marino tracked down advertising copywriter Leroy Holsapple , the man who may have first intercepted Favre when , as an 8 year old , he picked off a wild toss across the middle of the field during a 1979 Pop Warner game ." We ' ve seen a lot of interceptions tonight , " Marino said in conclusion as another painstakingly edited Favre interception montage , the ninth and last in the program , played behind him . " Were all of them were his fault ? Maybe not it ' s not for us to say . Am I jealous of his record ? Maybe . I never considered myself to be all that concerned with statistics , and with my plus 168 TD to interception record , I ' ll never know what it ' s like to be " Mr 278 , " the all time interception king . Because the man who holds that record , perhaps forever , is Brett Favre . " 	 1
WASHINGTON , DC In allegations likely to further erode Americans ' faith in the office of the presidency , presidents George Washington through George W . Bush may have lied about key matters of national import during their tenures as chief executive , an independent counsel investigation asserted Monday .The report states that the integrity of the presidency " may have been compromised by criminal misdirection , obstruction of justice , and deliberate clouding of the truth for political advantage and or personal gain by as many as every president since the nation ' s inception . "While conventional wisdom holds that only two U . S . presidents , Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton , have ever openly lied about anything , the report offers substantial evidence linking all 42 presidents to deliberate acts of deception and dishonesty . Among its assertions are that Thomas Jefferson lied about impregnating one of his slaves Ulysses S . Grant deceived Congress regarding his role in the Whiskey Ring scandal Ronald Reagan intentionally withheld key facts in the Iran Contra Affair Warren G . Harding told untruths during the Teapot Dome scandal James K . Polk , Martin Van Buren , and Chester A . Arthur fibbed about the details of trade pacts and Franklin Pierce was less than forthcoming regarding details of the Kansas Nebraska Act ." Shockingly , even William Henry Harrison , a president who was in office for a month and spent most of it on his deathbed , seems to have found time to lie during the famously lengthy inaugural address that would speed his demise , " independent counsel investigator James McManus said . " And so called ' father of our country ' George Washington is not exempt , either . A story familiar to any schoolchild tells us that , as a boy , Washington confessed to chopping down a cherry tree , saying , ' I cannot tell a lie . ' Evidence suggests , however , that the entire tale may have been bogus from the start . This is doubly damning to the presidency ' s reputation , for it is not merely a lie , but a lie about not telling lies . "The report calls into question the integrity of the presidency at a particularly inopportune moment . Coming on the heels of alleged Bush Administration involvement in the Enron and WorldCom corporate scandals , as well as the " Monicagate " impeachment trial of former president Bill Clinton , the implication of every president in U . S . history will likely deepen the public ' s mistrust and further undermine the credibility of the nation ' s highest elected office ." If these allegations turn out to be true , this country faces a crisis of confidence of unfathomable proportions , " an anonymous Beltway insider said . " If the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth cannot be trusted to tell the truth , then who , in the name of God in heaven , can ? "" We are shocked by these allegations , " White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said . " The president wishes to assure the public that he has never lied , and that every one of these accusations of lying from the 18th century all the way to the 21st will be thoroughly investigated and , we are confident , disproved . "Calling the report " just the tip of the iceberg , " McManus said incidents of lying may plague the government at all levels ." Every day , new evidence surfaces suggesting that this lying trend is more far reaching than we ever imagined , " McManus said . " It may well extend all the way to the offices of Vice President , Speaker of the House , Secretary of State , Secretary of Defense , Secretary of the Treasury , White House Press Secretary , secretary to the White House Press Secretary , Senator , Representative , State Assemblyman , Governor , Lieutenant Governor , County Board Supervisor , Alderperson , Mayor , Assistant to the Mayor , City Councilperson , Assistant City Councilperson , Comptroller , Town Coroner , County Librarian , and County Clerk . "On Capitol Hill , the report prompted calls for a thorough investigation of each and every allegation , from the possibility of Bush Cheney lies regarding Haliburton during the 2000 presidential campaign all the way back to alleged lies told by the John Adams Administration regarding the Huron Indians in 1798 ." The idea that presidents and other elected officials have violated the public trust by telling lies is disturbing and deeply disappointing , " U . S . Sen . Orrin Hatch ( R UT ) said . " We are adopting a ' zero tolerance ' position regarding the telling of untruths on the part of any politician past , present , or future and we will not rest until each and every lie teller has been punished to the fullest extent of the law . "Added Hatch : " You have my solemn word on that . " 	 1

Washington , D . C . Hundreds marched on Washington in protest over the recent tasing of White Nationalist sympathizer , Lew Rockwell , today .Shouts of " White ! Pow er . White ! Pow er , " and , " Ron Paul ! Ron Paul ! " were amongst the neo Nazi ' s and Ku Klux Klan ' s favored chants . Moreover , many of the marchers waved fake 500 . 00 bills in commemoration of White Supremacist , Don Black ' s ( of Stormfront ) recent endorsement of the Republican Presidential candidate .The protest itself was the result of a spur of the moment grassroots effort , explained event organizer , " WhiteRevolution , " of a Ron Paul discussion forum dedicated to all things Ron Paul related . Unfortunately , much of what " WhiteRevolution " explained cannot be reprinted here due to the graphic nature of the discussion .However , to quote others , the tasing was the result of a conspiracy involving the " Zionists " and " multicultural fascists " including supposed " elements within our own government that conspired to blow up the World Trade Center buildings in New York City , " as well as " illegal aliens from Mexico who hate white people " and finally , " that black couple " who recently moved in down the block from Lew Rockwell .Although the recent tasing of Lew Rockwell only made the local news , the event itself was spectacular by any standard . According to Rockwell , he was merely distressed over the fact that a black couple moved in some distance from his home , a neighborhood that is otherwise inhabited only by Caucasians . " The only thing I ' ve done is complain to a neighbor about the situation , " Rockwell explained in his hospital bed . " Next thing I know , fire trucks , police cars , SWAT vans , black helicopters , and the National Guard are screeching to a halt in front of my home " !Rockwell claims that the events from that point forward are a bit hazy . However , despite the fact that he describes being hit with " a massive bolt of lightening , " Rockwell clearly remembers his last pleas : " For the love Sweet Jesus don ' t tase me bro " !Awaking to an emergency room filled with " multicultural " medical professionals didn ' t help the situation either for Rockwell . " And then I wake up , and here ' s all these off white people in the room . I thought I was having a nightmare ! And what ' s worse , the Doctor was a Black man ! " .Word of the event spread like wildfire throughout the Internet ' s White Nationalist community and Ron Paul discussion sites . In only a matter of hours , a massive protest was planned , and executed . And although Dr Paul was unable to attend the rally on such short notice , Don Black praised not only the enthusiasm of Paul ' s followers , but stated that this event proves that " Ron Paul ' s message of Freedom and Liberty is bringing us together in ways not seen since before the Civil War " . 	 1
Fraping , or the act of logging onto somebody else ' s Facebook account and posting something inordinately witty as their status , has finally reached the mobile age ." In the past , people would be around at a friends house , and they would see the laptop open and logged into Facebook , then add a witty comment , " said Facebook Fraping Expert , Stacy Tupdate . " Normally , they would ' out ' the Facebook owner by admitting to be gay . In fact , that ' s all anybody puts . "Now , with the advent of Smart Phones and Facebook apps , people are logged into Facebook all the time on their phones ." We ' re seeing cases of people being Fraped while in the pub , " said Tupdate . " They ' ll go to the bar to get a particularly complicated order . By the time that they get back , their Facebook Status has announced that they ' re really gay . "With it now being so easy for people to be Fraped by their mobile device , the frapists are getting more inventive ." I saw one fraping that announced that they were not only gay , " Said Tupdate , " but also that they were going to Thailand to have everything lopped off . "As well as changing the status of people ' s Facebook profile , Frapists are having a good look through those pictures marked as private . Particularly embarrassing ones are then been marked as visible to everyone and anyone . This is particularly malicious as most people don ' t periodically check the privacy settings on embarrassing photos ." I found this particularly fun , " said Tupdate . " When somebody has marked the picture of them at a 1970s disco as completely private , and suddenly , it ' s their profile picture , that ' s hilarious . "However , Tupdate has pointed out the serious side to this ." Any kind of Fraping is a form of cyberbullying , " she said with a frown . " It is to be frowned upon . If you see a friend ' s phone unlocked on the table , don ' t load Facebook and have a good luck through it before changing the profile picture and status . Be a friend and leave it where it is . "Occasionally , it back fires on the Frapist . " We had one case , " said Tupdate , " where the Frapist was looking through for a good profile picture , only to discover his best friend had a picture of him wearing a little white frock at the Manchester Pride festival . So be careful . " 	 1
American Idol contestant Antonella Barba can relax and try to sing . Photographic Experts from the L . A . Police Department ' s Crime Lab have determined that nude pictures of her posted on the internet were actually faked .In converstation , David Shutters of the police department said . " Yes , they are not really her . We ' ve studied the evidence thoroughly and determined that Antonella is not the girl in the pictures . "" If we do an internet search by her name on Yahoo Images , we come up with a list of several photos . The first one shows a girl sliding down a pool slide with Chevy Chase . We have determined that this is the character Lacy from the Caddyshack movie . They just cropped in her face . "" It is the same in the next picture . That is actually the blonde girl that the John Belushi character plays peeping tom on in the Animal House . "" You will note that while both of these girls are blondes in their movies , Antonella is not . We first noticed the differences when we saw that one had a larger rack than the other , though both were worthy of notice . "" In fact , her height , weight , breast size , tattoos , moles , scars , tan lines , and shaving style seem to change from one picture to the next . "" We are only 95 sure of ourselves at this point . To make a final determination that none of these pictures are the real Antonella , we have asked the young lady to come down to the department and undress for us . We will then ask her to pose in the same position as all of the photos and compare scientifically to determine whether or not it is really her . " 	 1
A lowly clerk working in the Department of Work and Pensions was today accused of murdering Margaret Thatcher this morning , following the revelation that the former Prime Minister died after reading a letter from the clerk informing the Baroness that ATOS healthcare had decided that she was " Fit for work " , and requesting that she should report to the nearest jobcentre for an immediate start on the work programme , probably stacking shelves in Poundland for at least 16 weeks of unpaid work . This is in line with government policy that Thatcher herself introduced in the 1980s when she put 200 , 000 miners out of work for no reason at all , other than the fact they got their hands dirty and had the nerve to ask for a fair day ' s pay .The Department had already noticed that the Baroness was living in a flash hotel instead of the penthouse suite at Nelson Mandela Towers , Hackney , which had been allocated to her following the government ' s decision to move all taxpayer funded council house tenants into housing with one less bedroom than they actually need .The Department were about to serve an enforcement notice on Thatcher to force her to move to the tower block and leave the bedroom at the Ritz free for a group of 19 asylum seekers who were on their way from Syria with a girl who had been shot in the head because she ' d told her father she quite fancied going to school that day .The government department that sent the letter to Thatcher was today slammed by campaigning groups who stated that it was no co incidence that the letter had arrived on the day that she had died , and that there was a direct correlation between reading benefit related letters and severe stroke , proven by a recent spike in letter related deaths , as revealed by the Mail On Sunday . They accuse the DWP of " Murder By Laser Printer " .It was claimed by the group that 300 , 000 lives could be saved each year if the DWP stopped sending out letters altogether .The DWP has denied sending the letter altogether , stating that firstly , it would be unlikely that a clerk would have permission to send out any letters within three weeks of a bank holiday , and the likelihood of the Royal Mail delivering it within a month , or in fact ever , was extremely slim indeed .Police investigating the sending of the letter stated that enquiries were ongoing , and it is probable that further arrests will be made in the near future , depending on shift patterns and whether any children had possibly been involved more than 30 years ago . 	 1
New Yawk , New Yawk In an attempt to boost the ratings of his Fox News show , Geraldo At Large , Gerardo Rivera posted a nearly nude photograph of himself or , rather , his mirror image on Twitter . Minutes later , it had been deleted , although it is unclear as to whether Rivera himself or Twitter deleted the offensive picture , and some mass media insiders contend that Fox News chief Roger Ailes himself ordered the sensationalistic journalist to remove the photograph as " unbecoming " to the network .The photograph showed Rivera naked , but for a towel that he held , strategically draped about his bony hips , and the rose colored glasses he was wearing as he made a spectacle of himself .He looked emaciated , with skinny arms , those who saw the picture claim . " He looked like a 98 pound weakling , " Marcie Scott said , " not the studly , macho man that he tries to come off as being on his show . "" It was pretty gross , " Marcie ' s boyfriend , Ethan , said . " It made me want to puke . "" He looked like Gaddafi , after the Libyan leader had been killed , " Shirley Beaver agreed .Rivera appears to be standing in a bathroom . He has a cellular telephone in hand , and he seems to be taking a picture of himself with the telephone ' s built in camera . The image is fuzzy and surreal .The controversial " journalist " said he posted the dirty picture " because I ' m a dirty old man . " He also wants " America and the world " to see what a " sexy man " looks like at seventy . " Hell , I could be fifty , " he bragged . " At first , " Charlene O ' Hara said , " I thought the towel was an adult diaper and he was posting an ad for Depends . "Bill O ' Reilly , who frequently invites Rivera to guest on The O ' Reilly Factor says that , in his opinion , Rivera posted the risque picture for the same reason he does everything : " to generate publicity . "If so , Rivera ' s ploy doesn ' t seem to have been all that effective . At last count , according to Rivera , his post had garnered only three comments , all against his having posted the photograph . ( Twitter claims that the picture received zero comments . )Pretty much everyone agrees on two things , though : The host of Geraldo At Large doesn ' t appear to be very " large , " nor does he seem to be all that bright . 	 1

Prosecutor David Leyton said the lone charge filed against Abuelazam is related to a stabbing in Flint , Michigan on July 27 .With a manhunt on in connection to the stabbing spree , Michigan police received a tip that sent them Wednesday to a market where the suspect worked , Leyton said . After talking with employees , police watched surveillance video to determine if he matched the physical description of the attacker .After tracking him to Louisville , Kentucky , authorities learned he had bought a 3 , 000 ticket from Atlanta to Tel Aviv , Israel , paid for by his uncle . Leyton said Abuelazam had flown from Detroit , Michigan , to Louisville and then on to Atlanta . It was not clear whether he was already en route to Atlanta when authorities identified him as a suspect in the killings .A federal law enforcement official involved in the investigation said the man was traveling on an expired Israeli passport but was in the United States legally .Upon confirmation of his identity , the man was placed in the custody of the FBI and the Atlanta Police Department .Over the past week investigators from a Michigan task force police departments in Leesburg , Virginia , and Toledo , Ohio the FBI and numerous other law enforcement agencies have investigated leads and tips from the public .Authorities have said the same person is responsible for three recent attacks in Leesburg , Virginia , the stabbing deaths of five people and wounds to nine others in the Flint , Michigan , area and a stabbing Saturday that wounded a man in Toledo , Ohio .Fourteen of the 16 victims in Michigan were African American , police said . Flint is a majority African American community . In majority white Leesburg , Virginia , two victims were black and one was Latino .Leesburg Police Chief Joseph Price said he believed the suspect was targeting African Americans ." For our community . . . when you look at our demographics and you look at the victims here , my belief is he selected the victims in Leesburg based on the color of their skin , " Price said .The Michigan attacks began May 24 , with the most recent taking place August 2 . The three attacks in Virginia occurred Tuesday , Thursday and Friday of last week .The Michigan victims ranged in age from 17 to 60 , authorities said . All of the victims were men , and in two cases they were people with special needs .The suspect is said to have approached victims who were on foot during the early morning hours , asking for directions or other assistance to lure them close to his car , police said .

Bill Wauford of the Toledo Police Department said the method of attack in the Ohio case matched that described in the Michigan incidents .The five Michigan fatalities were identified as David Motley , Emmanuel Dent , Darwin Marshall , Frank Kellybrew and Arnold Miner .Leyton said Abuelazam worked in Flint until August 2 and then told fellow workers he was going to Virginia . He said the suspect had lived in the Flint area since May in a home owned by his uncle . The suspect had a previous address in Florida .Arlington , Virginia , police arrested the suspect on August 5 for failure to obey a highway sign . At the time , police learned he had an outstanding warrant for a prior assault and he was arrested and his 1996 Chevy Blazer was impounded . Police found a knife and hammer inside the car .But he was released that day , and the circumstances of his release were not clear .Also that day , a victim was stabbed in the area , but he told police the assailant was driving a different vehicle . The Blazer was returned to the suspect that night .Abuelazam was in all three states at the time of the stabbings in those states , according to authorities . After police identified his vehicle , they tracked him near an airport in Louisville , Kentucky .Leyton said the suspect was in Toledo at the time of the stabbing there .Investigators continue to investigate and Leyton said more charges are expected .Members of the Michigan task force were in Atlanta Thursday , and Leyton ' s office was preparing papers for extradition .According to Tracy Flanagan of the Fulton County Sheriff ' s Office , Abuelazam was processed at the Fulton County Jail and is being held there for the 68th District Court of Flint , Michigan . Barring special circumstances , he should have an extradition hearing in the coming days ." We ought to remember the victims in all of this , " Leyton said . " You have real people who have died and real families who have been torn apart . Our heart goes out to them . " 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC Following the tragic falling death of 32 year old methamphetamine addict Phillip Diggs , who was reportedly attacked by spiders while scaling a large construction crane near Palo Alto , CA , thousands of outraged and confused meth addicts marched frenetically on Washington as part of a week of activities urging the federal government to address the nation ' s growing spider epidemic ." Something needs to be done and it needs to be done soon these spiders are everywhere , " said Rich Harlowe , event organizer and founder of Tweakers ' Rights NowNowNowNowNowNowNowNowNow ! , in testimony before a Senate committee Tuesday . " The government must address this problem before the situation gets out of hand and these poisonous , acid shooting spiders develop the powers of mind control or God forbid flight . "" America cannot afford to ignore this any crisis any longer , " Harlowe added .The rally drew addicts from every part of the country , many traveling on foot through the night , trading sex with truck drivers for rides , or stealing their brothers in law ' s bicycles . At dozens of rambling public speeches , organizers decried the fact that it took the spider related death of an innocent meth addict to raise awareness of the issue , while lauding the bravery of meth addicts , and methamphetamines themselves .A 45 , 000 word proposal was drafted by members of TRN during a marathon , 72 hour meeting under the Roosevelt Bridge , and presented twice to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee . The document , which includes schematics for the development of a giant " spider bomb " the size of Rhode Island , concludes repeatedly that the problem would best be combated with large quantities of methamphetamines and steel wool ." This very morning , I saw a small child completely covered in hairy , bloodsucking , screaming tarantulas while his parents stood by and did nothing , " said protester Joe Lopez , pausing to spit out a black and decayed tooth . " I was appalled . I shouted horrible profanities and incantations at them , but they ignored me . "" I , I , I don ' t this is just , just , just I , I , I guh , ah , " he added .TRN activists claimed that they called for federal assistance only as a last resort , after months of trying to contain the problem with diplomacy , force , cathode rays , and methamphetamines ." These spiders are unstoppable , " meth addict and self described spider hater Christine Mitchell said . " We ' ve tried everything from scrubbing ourselves raw with bleach , to burning them off with lit cigarettes , to scrubbing ourselves raw with bleach . We ' ve even tried burning them off with lit cigarettes . We ' re out of options . "Mitchell urged senators to form an anti spider task force , but cautioned that the creatures ' ability to appear and disappear at will would rule out a bleach related " quick fix " solution to the infestation .Several other unnamed addicts who wandered in and out of the hearings described their efforts to establish " an open dialogue " with the spiders , but said the arachnids responded by growing dramatically in size and speaking with the voices of John Goodman , Gene Hackman , and Rosie Perez , bringing the first round of negotiations to an abrupt end ." We tried talking to them , we tried screaming at them , we tried bursting into uncontrollable crying fits in front of them , but nothing seemed to work , " said one witness , who refused to divulge his name , age , or " who sent him here . " " Even with human heads , they would not listen to reason . "Though most committee members had left the hearings before Harlowe ' s closing remarks at 3 : 30 a . m . Wednesday , some indicated a willingness to investigate the addicts ' claims more closely ." I believe it is our duty and responsibility to act before we lose even more Americans of voting age , " said Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D CA ) , who noted that her home state had more meth addicts than any other in the country . " Pollsters tell us that one in five voters is , has been , or will be a meth addict at some point in their lifetimes . That ' s a voting bloc too big for us to ignore . " 	 1
LOWELL , MA What was meant to be a relaxing family gathering was transformed into a heated , hours long competition on Saturday , as 3 year old Nicholas Aunchman and 41 year old Sandy Aunchman vied with one another for the attention of their relatives .The barbecue , which began shortly after 4 p . m . , saw both emotionally fragile and needy family members square off in their attempts to be the evening ' s sole focal point ." Nicholas was a real handful tonight , " said Joel Aunchman , 35 , the toddler ' s father and Sandy ' s younger brother . " He was pretty revved up by how many people were at the barbecue and he just wanted to be right in the middle of everything . "" And my sister was well , she was my sister , " Joel added .According to those in attendance , Sandy established herself as the center of attention immeditately upon her arrival . After fixing herself the first of many cocktails , she reportedly drowned out all the other guests with a loud account of her " incredibly hectic " week .Sandy ' s dominance only lasted an estimated two minutes , however , at which point family members watched Nicholas bound into the backyard , arms stretched out at his sides ." Vroosh , " the excited boy shouted , as the dozen or so attendees turned their attention to him . " Look at me ! I ' m a jumbo jet ! Vroosh ! "But Sandy soon approached the crowd gathered around her nephew and forcefully seized control of the conversation ." Nicholas was telling us about saber toothed tigers when Sandy cut him off and announced that her divorce had just been finalized , " said cousin Lyle Peters , 44 . " Then she proceeded to bring up her ex husband ' s affair and how she just knows her lawyer screwed her over . "" If Nicholas hadn ' t marched back up a few minutes later and made us come see the rocks he ' d found , I would ' ve been stuck listening to her sob story all night , " Peters added .Over the next several hours , Sandy and her nephew jockeyed back and forth in an escalating contest of one upmanship . Witnesses gave accounts of numerous instances in which Nicholas interrupted dinner discussions by insisting that everyone either sing the alphabet song with him , or watch how fast he could run around the picnic tables .Meanwhile , Sandy circulated the crowd telling heavily embellished stories about her brushes with fame , made baseless accusations about close friends , and even suggested it be might time for Nicholas to take a nap .Shortly after dinner , Nicholas suddenly announced that his tummy hurt , eliciting a chorus of sympathetic moans . Within seconds , Sandy proclaimed that " her stomach hurt , too , " before adding , " but nobody cares about Sandy . " Even after receiving assurances of sympathy , Sandy delved deeper in her quest for pity , suggesting that her ailment was probably phantom pain from her hysterectomy 14 years earlier , which , she noted , had left her " unable to have any children of her own " .As the struggle stretched into the night , both contestants reportedly took up desperate , high risk strategies to secure attention ." I saw Nicholas intentionally pulling my daughter ' s hair , so I went over to have a talk with him , " said Sandy ' s younger sister Carol Brownell . " But as I was doing so , Sandy sidled up next to my husband and began flirting with him right in front of everyone . "The contest reportedly reached its climax around 9 : 30 p . m . , when a drunken Sandy screamed at her parents for a " lifetime of neglect , " then sat down at a patio table , buried her head in her hands , and burst into tears .Almost simultaneously , a tired and cranky Nicholas screamed about how " no one was looking at him , " before sobbing hysterically .Both participants then passed out and had to be carried home . 	 1

A subsidiary of Johnson Johnson pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal criminal charge that it sold over the counter infant ' s and children ' s liquid medicine containing metal particles .McNeil Consumer Healthcare , of Fort Washington , Pennsylvania , acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering the adulterated bottles of Infants ' and Children ' s Tylenol and Children ' s Motrin . The company agreed to pay 25 million to resolve the case .Metal particles , including nickel , iron and chromium , were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil ' s plant in Fort Washington . Prosecutors said McNeil knew about the problem for nearly a year but failed to take immediate steps to fix it .Admission : McNeil Consumer Healthcare acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering adulterated bottles of Infants ' and Children ' s Tylenol and Children ' s Motrin which contained metal particlesThe company and prosecutors said in court Tuesday that no one was injured .' McNeil ' s failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices is seriously troubling , ' Acting Assistant Attorney General Mizer said in a statement after the judge accepted McNeil ' s plea .' The Department of Justice will continue to be aggressive in pursuing and punishing companies such as McNeil that disregard a process designed to assure quality medicines , especially OTC drugs for infants and children , ' he said .McNeil is a unit of Johnson Johnson . The New Brunswick , New Jersey , health care giant has struggled with scores of product recalls since 2009 .In this case , McNeil first learned of the particle problem in May 2009 , when a consumer complained about black specks inside a bottle of Infants ' Tylenol , according to court documents . McNeil subsequently found metal particles during production but continued making the liquid medicines for several more months .Products : Metal particles , including nickel , iron and chromium , were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil ' s plant in Fort Washington' There were investigative steps taken , but not all of the steps required under all of our internal operating procedures , ' company attorney Michael Schwartz told The Associated Press on Tuesday .McNeill eventually traced the problem to the machinery at its plant in Fort Washington and issued a recall . The Food and Drug Administration said the potential for serious medical problems was remote but advised consumers to stop using the medicine .The suburban Philadelphia plant which was linked to several recalls of Tylenol and other nonprescription drugs for children and adults was shuttered in April 2010 and rebuilt from the ground up , but it has yet to reopen .The company is operating under an agreement with the FDA requiring increased inspections and oversight at its factories .McNeil said Tuesday it has significantly improved its procedures .' McNeil has been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business to ensure we are best able to meet our commitment to consumers , patients and doctors who rely on our products , ' company spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said . 	 0
Like a combination of disinfectant and vomit .That ' s how a Royal Caribbean cruise passenger described the ship ' s smell after hundreds aboard fell ill .Shannon Blace had boarded the ship in Cape Liberty , New Jersey on January 21 for with her fiance and 10 other friends and family members .Of the 12 , nine got sick , she said Monday night . One of the women in her group got sick twice .By Tuesday morning , the number had risen to 10 when her fiance fell ill and was ordered quarantined in his room , she said .It was supposed to have been a 10 day cruise . But the liner announced it was cutting it short by two days as a result of the outbreak .The atmosphere in the ship ' s usually bustling promenade deck was subdued on Tuesday . " Everywhere you look , you see dreary sad faces , " Blace said in a telephone interview . " Just unhappy people everywhere " waiting to get back to New Jersey . "In all , 622 of the 3 , 071 passengers and 50 of the 1 , 165 crew members became ill , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .They reported vomiting and diarrhea .A CDC vessel sanitation program epidemiologist , a contract epidemiologist and an environmental health officer boarded the ship in St . Thomas on the U . S . Virgin Islands to study the outbreak and the response on the voyage back to Cape Liberty .Five specimens were sent Sunday to the CDC lab for testing .The cause of the illness was not clear , though the symptoms are consistent with norovirus , the cruise line said .Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis , which produces vomiting and diarrhea ." The number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise , and most guests who fell ill are up and about , " the cruise line said Monday in a Monday ." The drop in new cases is encouraging . However , it is not unusual in an outbreak to still have smaller , secondary spikes . That is why , after discussions with the U . S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our medical team , we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on Wednesday , two days earlier than planned . "The company said all passengers would get a 50 refund and a 50 credit for a future cruise .Those passengers who were ordered quarantined to their rooms will get an additional credit of one future cruise day for each day in confinement , it said .After returning to home port on Wednesday , the ship will be cleaned " to make certain that any remaining traces of the illness are eliminated , " the liner said in a statement ." Guests scheduled for the next cruise on Explorer of the Seas can be confident that all possible measures will have been taken to prevent further problems , " it added .Explorer of the Seas departed Cape Liberty on January 21 for what was to have been a 10 day cruise .It had been scheduled to call to Labadee , Haiti San Juan , Puerto Rico Charlotte Amalie , St . Thomas and Philipsburg , St . Maarten . It missed port calls in Haiti and St . Maarten . 	 0
Under new plans from The Department of Work and Pensions , part time workers could receive monthly statements telling them how much better off they would be if they increased their hours .They could also be sent texts telling them that working more hours or getting better paid work would leave them " quids in " when Universal Credit begins to be rolled out later this year .' Better Off Calculator 'An online calculator could allow claimants to find out within seconds how much better off they would be from boosting their hours . It will be simpler to use than normal calculators , as it will prompt users in what to enter . The calculator will ask the user their hourly wage and how many hours they work per week and will use its secret multiplication calculatory skills to work out a user ' s current weekly wage . Then it will tell them how much more they would earn if they worked a certain amount of hours more , by multiplying the number of hours more by the user ' s wage .A spokesman for The Department of Work and Pensions said , ' Calculators are amazing . We at The Department of Work and Pensions feel very strongly about embracing new technology . 'Minister for Employment , Mark Hoban expanded on the proposals :" At the moment too many people are trapped working 16 hours a week by a system which means there ' s no point extending their hours because they ' d be worse off . By informing people they could earn more if they got higher paying jobs , we will ensure that people get better jobs . 'Ministers said today that these are just some of the ideas being considered as to how the Government can help low paid workers to increase their hours or move into better paid jobs under Universal Credit . Ministers also called for people to contribute other initiatives which can then be piloted . 	 1
austin, tx practically every single thing that occurs during the average day of film buff murphy gibson, 31, reminds him in some way of the films of robert altman, irritated sources reported tuesday. " the other night, murph and i went to perkins to get some coffee after the campus kurosawa retrospective, " said roommate and fellow film buff jerry chaplin. " i figured for at least this one night, we could maybe talk about kurosawa for a change, but no. murph just kept going on and on about the huge american flag fluttering over the perkins parking lot, talking about how the jarring juxtaposition of oversized political iconography with the crass commercialism of a family dining chain was'pure altman.'" " i mean, we'd just seen rashomon and i live in fear, for chrissakes, " chaplin said. " i appreciate altman's status as the premier maverick auteur of american cinema as much as the next guy, but give it a rest once in a while, you know? " gibson, described by friends as " excitable and somewhat high strung " when discussing directors he admires, used to be captivated by the work of such major american filmmakers as stanley kubrick, john cassavetes, and martin scorsese. in recent years, however, he has focused on altman with " an almost maniacal single mindedness " that those close to him call " unsettling. " gibson, known within austin area esoteric film appreciation circles as " possibly the only person on earth who counts o. c. stiggs among his favorite films, " has long annoyed friends, relatives, acquaintances, and even people he just met in line at the grocery store with his altman obsession. during a february 1997 night out with coworkers, as the assembled group headed toward the parking lot behind the karaoke bar where they had spent the evening, he subjected them to a 10 minute dissertation on the famous murder sequence from the player, even though only two of the 12 people present had seen the film. in april 1998, he alienated the entire extended family of keith robbins, his sister shelley's then fianc, by comparing robbins'mother to " the duplicitous louise fletcher character from thieves like us. " the situation was exacerbated when, several months later, he insisted on comparing aspects of keith and shelley's wedding reception to many of the darker moments from altman's little known 1978 ensemble film a wedding. alarmingly, friends say gibson's insistence on finding everything he encounters altmanesque is only getting worse. " i'll admit, altman deserves credit for his innovative use of improvisational acting and the way he employs it to draw out the difficult and ambivalent moments in interpersonal relations, but murph has really been getting out of hand lately, " said karen blakely, who met gibson in the late'80s while they were film studies majors at the university of texas. " the other day, i made the mistake of mentioning an article i saw about parents of deaf children who have difficulty relating to their kids. suddenly, he gets this look in his eye. before he could say anything, i told him, straight out,'murph, i swear to god, if you say one word about ned beatty's character from nashville, i'm gonna split your lip. " the final straw, blakely said, came last monday, when a group of friends gathered at her house to watch monday night football. " we're all watching the game, and this commercial comes on for kfc. suddenly, murph perks up and is all like,'see that cartoon colonel? with his little white beard, genteel southern mannerisms, and frenetic, almost claustrophobic use of space, you know who he reminds me of?'" blakely said. " i said,'murph, if you think that chicken mascot has anything to do with robert altman whatsoever, you are completely insane.'it ruined the whole game for everybody. " asked for comment on his admirer, altman, currently doing publicity for his upcoming film dr t and the women, declined to pass judgment. " i don't think i should talk about people's opinions of me or my films, " altman said.

WASHINGTON In recognition of mankind ' s inherent propensity for tragically foolish decisions , Congress allocated nearly 500 billion Monday for the construction of a new national monument honoring human folly ." From Hannibal ' s disastrous crossing of the Alps to Custer ' s humiliating defeat at Little Bighorn , human history has been plagued by senseless mistakes , and it is high time we built a memorial to honor that history , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D CA ) said of the expensive and ill advised monument . " My deepest hope is that future generations of Americans will one day look upon this pointless edifice and be filled with a sense of awe and wonder at mankind ' s utter lack of foresight . "" To think of all the ways our time and money could have been better spent , " Pelosi continued . " I can imagine no more fitting tribute . "According to the bipartisan plan , the proposed monument will be built precariously over a Washington freeway overpass , and will require as many as 30 years of grueling labor to complete . As a representation of humanity ' s failure to learn from past mistakes , the project is being designed by the architecture firm of Ganz Weiss , best known for their work on a series of dangerously constructed St . Louis public housing projects that were condemned in the late 1990s ." Our goal is to create a structure that , like the human race itself , is doomed from the outset and plagued by innate flaws that can never be corrected , " Sen . George Voinovich ( R OH ) said of the monument , which he claimed would eventually sink into the federally protected wetlands that surround it . " Not only will it be an aesthetic disaster , but it will also require constant , expensive maintenance just to ensure that the whole foundation doesn ' t topple suddenly and kill hundreds of innocent people . "The lead architect on the project , Robert Wheeler , told reporters that the monument would be a stirring testament to more than 200 , 000 years of arrogance , idiocy , and waste . He also confirmed that no fewer than eight different blueprint designs would be clumsily patched together in order to preserve the spirit of indecision and gross incompetence with which mankind has approached the vast majority of its endeavors ." The face of the building will be covered with recently excavated sections of the Titanic , as well as several faulty pressure valves from the Chernobyl power plant and hundreds of uranium tipped shell casings from the first Gulf War , " said Wheeler , whose design calls for the monument to be surrounded by dozens of oil derricks pumping night and day into bare dirt . " But the most exciting feature of the memorial , in my opinion , is the giant glowing orb at the top that will symbolize humanity ' s needless overuse of energy and will itself use a staggering 12 gigawatts of power per second . "According to sources , thousands of poorly paid migrant laborers will carry out construction on the monument , digging straight through underground power lines and gas mains in order to clear a space for the soon to be dilapidated foundation . In addition , officials from the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the construction zone has already been designated as a highly toxic Superfund site , setting the entire project three months behind schedule ." So far we ' ve spent 40 billion and lost a total of 300 or so construction workers , and we haven ' t even put in a full day ' s work , " said project manager Tom Matthiessen . " It ' s been a challenge , but knowing that we ' re doing this to commemorate the countless lives and resources squandered by human beings throughout history makes it all worthwhile . "Added Matthiessen , " At this rate , I ' d say the whole project should be a total , top to bottom nightmare by late December . "Although a vast majority of legislators supported the 500 billion bill , a few dissenting voices claimed that the project is an improper use of congressional funds ." While I am all for paying homage to mankind ' s tragic legacy of imprudence , surely there are more appropriate ways to do so than this , " Sen . Richard Lugar ( R IN ) said . " Why can ' t we simply give the money back to the taxpayers so they can waste it all on bad investments , botched plastic surgery , and misguided real estate deals ? Wouldn ' t that be a more suitable way of recognizing the complete inanity of our pathetic existence ? "At press time , Congress , and all of humanity itself , was trapped in a self perpetuating loop of failure that is expected to continue until the inevitable extinction of the human species . 	 1
The FBI has begun a preliminary inquiry into allegations by the CIA that Senate staffers obtained unauthorized access to classified documents related to the agency ' s now defunct post 9 11 interrogation program , according to people familiar with the matter .The CIA ' s charges , made in criminal referrals to the Justice Department , are in contrast to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein ' s accusations last week that the agency spied on computers used by committee staffers at a CIA facility to investigate the Bush era interrogation program .The committee staff has produced a 6 , 300 page report on the program , which critics say violated prohibitions on torture and exceeded legal guidance from the Justice Department .But the report remains in limbo , awaiting a declassification review by the CIA , which has disputed some of Senate findings .The unusual dispute has raised tensions between the agency and lawmakers charged with overseeing the agency ' s activities .Feinstein is usually one of the intelligence community ' s staunchest allies in Congress .Justice Department officials have tried to avoid getting drawn into the fight , and some lawmakers have questioned whether it is appropriate for Justice , as an agency in the executive branch , to probe a dispute between legislators and another agency .The FBI ' s preliminary inquiry is intended to determine whether a full fledged investigation is warranted , people familiar with the matter said .McClatchy Newspapers first reported the FBI inquiry .CIA Director John Brennan has disputed Feinstein ' s accusations .Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations last week , he said " when the facts come out on this , I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong . "Documents that prompted the dispute relate to an internal review by former CIA Director Leon Panetta and , according to the agency , were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee .The documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee .Feinstein said Senate staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error , and that they corroborated some of the committee ' s findings that the agency now says it disagrees with .She said committee staff routinely sees such documents and didn ' t violate any classified restrictions .Dean Boyd , a CIA spokesman , said in an op ed published in USA Today that the agency acted properly after it discovered Senate staffers may have accessed and retained sensitive documents stored in a CIA computer network ." These documents were privileged , deliberative , pre decisional executive branch material that implicated separation of powers concerns , " Boyd wrote . " Because we were concerned that there may have been a breach or vulnerability in the CIA local area network on which CIA stored these documents , CIA information technology specialists were asked to conduct a limited review to determine whether these files were located on the side of the CIA network the committee was authorized to use . That review appeared to confirm the committee ' s unauthorized access to the documents . " 	 0
In response to dwindling viewer levels , NBC is set to bring back the hit TV series Friends in its Fall lineup .NBC originally cut the show because of the unsustainable fees it was having the pay the original cast .' Joey ' , fronted by sexy ' funnyman ' Matt LeBlanc , was the only spin off series from the show due to LeBlanc ' s relatively low , 12 hr fee . The show was a flop , garnering lower ratings than NBC ' s niche program ' Celebrity Decorating Tips ' a do it yourself program featuring handy tips from popular celebrities . The show received 10m viewers for its most popular episode " Watching paint dry with Jay Leno " , totally shadowing Joey ' s 100k average .The Friends comeback has received positive feedback from die hard fans , mostly women in their mid thirties , many of whom have been petitioning NBC since it was cut , back in 2004 .NBC has managed to bring back all of the original cast for half their original cost since their careers went quickly downhill following the show ' s cancellation . Lisa Kudrow , who played the ditsy hippy character , Phoebe , is the only member of the original cast not to agree to the comeback . Due to fears of upsetting the fans , NBC has decided to kill off the character than bring in a replacement actor .Ross and Rachel ' s on and off relationship will continue in season 11 , but that Ross , David Schwimmer , will finally come to terms with his homosexuality .

" Said an NBC spokeswoman . " We just hope the hard hitting reality of these stories will lure more of the American public to coming back home to NBC . " 	 1
NEW YORK Looking to cover every possible angle of NFL training camp , Sports Illustrated has once again unleashed its army of 350 , 000 Peter King clones on the preseason workout facilities of all 32 NFL teams .Marching in lockstep , dressed in identical turquoise polo shirts and khaki pants while carrying reporter ' s notebooks in their left hands , the legion of indistinguishable sports journalists all reportedly maintain the same smile 24 hours a day , blink at the exact same time , and ask football related questions in unison .According to Sports Illustrated officials , there are currently 10 , 000 Peter King clones at each NFL training camp , with the remaining 30 , 000 assigned to Terrell Owens ." The King simulacra are a very effective journalism tool , " Sports Illustrated ' s assistant managing editor B . J . Schecter told reporters Friday , adding that no single human being could file six extensive training camp reports in a one week span . " At any given moment we might receive 84 , 000 different news items from 20 different training camps . These files are then uploaded directly from the on the ground clones to the Mother King , which hosts Peter King Prime ' s original brain . "Located in Sports Illustrated ' s spring training laboratory , the Mother King is suspended 200 feet above the stainless steel floor , floating in a glass container of cerebral fluid . By using an intricate network of thermionic tubes , King ' s technician attendants interface the brain with the publication ' s mainframe computer to upload training camp reports directly to SI . com in perfect Monday Morning Quarterback form ." Observe , " said Schecter , gesturing to a series of visible electric pulses transmitted by the brain through conductive tubing to the computer , which in turn immediately generated a 340 page printout . " Right now we are getting the fallout from the Dez Bryant situation in Dallas , a report on how Ben Roethlisberger ' s teammates are responding to him in Pittsburgh , and a personal anecdote about how the Peter Kings are back to drinking triple grande hazelnut lattes on their current road trip . "According to NFL teams , multiple Kings can be seen on the field , off the field , talking to fans , talking to coaches , and typing on their computers all at the same time . While this creates optimal training camp coverage , players and fans have complained that looking around and seeing a swarm of identical human beings occupying every spare inch of their facility can be disturbing .In addition , players have told reporters they do not enjoy being woken up every morning at 4 : 30 a . m . by the sound of 20 , 000 simultaneous footsteps marching into their respective camps ." They all write in their notebooks at the exact same time , " said Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez , adding that he was put off when an array of Peter Kings approached him in the locker room , extended their arms , and said " Hello , Mark . I ' m Peter . Care to answer some questions ? " in half human , half robotic voices . " I was relieved when the interview was over . But when I got onto the field there were 250 more Kings waiting for me who said , ' Hello , Mark . I ' m Peter . How would you assess the offense this year ? ' "" Peter King is everywhere , " Sanchez added ." It ' s definitely creepy , " Houston Texans running back Steve Slaton said . " The sight of 400 Peter King heads following my every cut and juke in perfect unison is just bizarre . Especially because his eyes don ' t move . Just his head , like a lizard . But the fact that the Texans are getting any media attention whatsoever , even from a hive mind controlled group of identical robotic sports reporters programmed to cover us , is actually kind of nice . "Built in 2003 by aging sportswriter and genius cybergeneticist Dr Frank Deford , the King duplicates originated from reproduced skin grafts and body parts of the late Peter King , a Sports Illustrated football journalist who died of a heart attack in 2002 while taping a segment for Inside The NFL .Deford , also referred to as " Father " by all Peter King clones , was unavailable to comment for this article . However , in a 2007 interview with HBO ' s Real Sports , a gaunt , sallow looking Deford can be seen gazing almost rapturously at 200 , 000 hibernating clones and calling them " a perfect sports journalist superorganism capable of carrying out its design function flawlessly and effortlessly . "He later orders the cameras to stop rolling when it appears as if one of the Peter King clones has lifted his head and is unexpectedly becoming operational .Deford has not been seen since . 	 1
Blackpool might be sitting bottom of the Sky Bet Championship table after just one win in 15 games but it seems the Seasiders have a secret weapon in their ranks .Teenager Dom Telford has only made a single first team appearance but has garnered a reputation for scoring wondergoals in the youth ranks twice being nominated for the League Football Education ' s goal of the month , which included a 35 yard chip against Liverpool that was a contender for goal of the season .And , the 18 year old has done it again with an outrageous solo goal in a youth team match against Padiham that saw him pick up the ball at the halfway line before gliding effortlessly past a succession of defenders and finishing with a rasping shot into the top corner .Dom Telford receives the ball on the halfway line in a youth team clash with PadihamThe 18 year old loses the attention of at least five defenders as he surges towards goalTelford closes in on the penalty area in a solo run that ' s reminiscent of Ryan Giggs ' legendary FA Cup strikeTelford escapes his last marker to finish with a thundering shot across the face of goalWith new manager Lee Clark ' s debut ending in a 2 0 home defeat by Ipswich on Saturday , which was Blackpool ' s fourth loss in a row , the time could be right to introduce some new blood if the Seasiders are going to stave off relegation this season .Clark returns to former club Fulham on Wednesday evening , where he insists sentiment will not get in the way of reversing Blackpool ' s fortunes .' I had seven fantastic years there . I ' ve got terrific memories of the place , but I ' m going there with allegiances to Blackpool and trying to get a result , ' he said .New Seasiders manager Lee Clark saw his debut end in a 2 0 defeat by IpswichThe Tangerines are in need of some inspiration after winning only once in 15 games this season 	 0
Palestinians channel their grief through a song for solidarityPalestinian relatives of Salaham Abu Jamea , 24 , who was killed by Israeli troops , mourn during his funeral in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Nov 6 , 2015 . Photo : Reuters( Page 1 of 2 ) NEXT PAGE SINGLE PAGEGAZA CITY ? My Homeland was once a triumphant military song , played with drums and trumpets , long the anthem of Palestinians . It has since transformed into a lament of a tumultuous region .In Gaza yesterday ( Nov 7 ) , Palestinians gathered to sing it in communities across the territory as part of a social media campaign organized through a Facebook page as a call for solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people for their freedom and rights .The campaign urged Palestinians in the West Bank , East Jerusalem and Gaza to take part in similar performances , and it also reached out to Palestinians living in the West , including in Norway and Washington .But even as the campaign sought to cast a wide net and reach a broad audience , the Palestinians in Gaza seemed to be singing mainly to one another , an act less about political solidarity than about the comfort of reassuring voices during a time of turmoil .The event came weeks into an uprising of demonstrations , stabbings and vehicular attacks against Israeli citizens and soldiers , and against the backdrop of a nearly decade old split between Hamas ruled Gaza and Palestinian communities in the West Bank governed by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority , of the rival Fatah party .In Gaza City , about 300 people , many wearing the black and white checkered Palestinian kaffiyeh , gathered in the hall of the Qattan Center for the Child to watch a children s choir perform the song . Adults held up cellphones , zooming in on their children .One mother , Inas Abu Shaban , 42 , former chief of the Palestinian women s police force in Gaza , held her son as she sang , My homeland , glory and beauty , sublime and splendid . Another woman giddily waved an enormous Palestinian flag .Palestinian poet Ibrahim Touqan wrote the words to My Homeland , or Mawtini , in 1934 , during another time of rebellion . The words posed a question : Will I see you safe , beautiful , victoriously honored ?The song became Iraq s national anthem about a decade ago , and since Islamic State militants poured into Syria and northern Iraq , Christians in those two countries sometimes sing it in churches , often accompanied by the oud , the saddest of Arab musical instruments .When you see the Arab homeland , we are all suffering . We are falling apart , Ms Abu Shaban said . Even when children sing it , they feel they have lost something ,( Page 1 of 2 ) NEXT PAGE SINGLE PAGE 	 0
BOSTON Now that Manny Ramirez has reported to camp and the spring training opener against Minnesota is in the books , Red Sox fans are turning their attention to the awesome power rumored to dwell within much touted off season pitching acquisition Daisuke Matsuzaka a man who many say possesses pitching powers and techniques beyond the comprehension of mortal fans ." Daisuke is the pitching master ! " said Boston Globe baseball columnist Bob Ryan , hopping from one foot to the other as he described videotape footage of Matsuzaka ' s otherworldly pitching power and control banishing a flock of evil , conniving , left handed batting carp spirits to the netherworld during a 2003 Seibu Lions game . " His Ultimate Galactic Dragon Gyroball Pitch Power Explosion breaks three feet inside before cutting sharply toward the dugout , where falsehood and cowardice are forced to shrink before it ! "Since before Boston signed Matsuzaka to a six year , 52 million contract last November , the city ' s baseball fans were inundated with incredible tales of the Japanese ace ' s pitching prowess , many of which seemed too good to be believed . Nevertheless , most Red Sox fans find it hard to contain their excitement at the thought of finally seeing Matsuzaka ' s skills on display ." Battle on , Daisuke ! Wither their spirits with your mystical Four Winds Split Finger Shottu jitsu ! Repel their cruel affronts with your Triple Star Cut Fastball Technique of the Joyous Uplifting Dynamo , clocked at a respectable 96 miles per hour ! And baffle their comprehension and deceive in turn their deceitful hearts with your Two Seam Shadow Strike Clouded Eye Shinobi Sinker ! " said 44 year old accountant and spring training attendee Roger Fettleman , quoting the back of Matsuzaka ' s Red Sox rookie card almost word for word as he watched the right hander warm up in the bullpen before his first Grapefruit League start . " Truly , it is within your grasp to go 16 4 with an ERA under 4 . 00 ! "Fettleman is hardly alone among Boston fans in having both his spirits and his expectations raised to unusual levels by the seven year veteran of Japan ' s top leagues . Besides the talk surrounding his alleged gyroball , rumors have circulated about his uncanny ability to read a batter , his cleverness in using his fastballs as his out pitches instead of over relying on breaking balls , and his almost inexhaustible wellspring of ki , or spirit energy ." If what we ' ve heard is correct , then Matsuzaka indeed possesses a Power Level of well over 9 , 000 , " said ESPN ' s Peter Gammons , struggling to contain his excitement on Tuesday ' s edition of Baseball Tonight . " Over 9 , 000 ! Which , of course , is only to be expected of the ballplayer whom sources say descended into the Underworld to spit in the flaming eye of the Lord of Hell and steal the secret power of the Onikaze , or ' demon storm ' pitch , which tails away nicely from both lefties and righties . "Despite the constant adulation and high expectations , the 27 year old right hander has been modest when dealing with the press ." Boston fans are the greatest fans in the world , " Matsuzaka told reporters through an interpreter upon being asked if he had left Japan out of fears that his Ultimate Galactic Dragon Gyroball Pitch Power Explosion might split Mount Fuji , strike the rising sun from the sky , and awaken the wrathful atomic lizard Gojira . " I ' m very happy and excited to be a member of the Red Sox . " 	 1

EST January 12 , 2016USA TODAY Sports ' George Schroeder looks ahead to the 2016 college football season , including who is the favorite to win in it all next season . USA TODAY SportsAlabama head coach Nick Saban poses with the championship trophy the morning after the Crimson Tide claimed it .PARADISE VALLEY , Ariz . ? Seated next to the College Football Playoff s national championship trophy , Alabama coach Nick Saban voiced concern Tuesday morning about the postseason format and suggested the bowl system and the national interest in a playoff might not parallel .I am concerned about how does a playoff and a bowl system coexist , Saban said , and how could we make it better , if it s possible , or get it right .Alabama earned its fourth national championship in seven seasons with a 45 40 victory Monday night against Clemson . It was the 15th game for both teams . Saban said he sensed the Crimson Tide s players didn t have as much energy as they d had 12 days earlier in a Cotton Bowl semifinal win against Michigan State .Why this Alabama championship season should be considered Nick Saban s bestIt was really , really difficult after a long season for us to maintain the sort of intensity that we had , he said .That might also have been true for fans . Overnight ratings for the national championship game were down 15 from last year , according to The Sports Business Journal , when the inaugural version of the Playoff created record ratings for cable TV . Some linked it to lower ratings in the semifinals ? played on New Year s Eve , they were down more than 36 from last year ? and suggested those created lessened interest in the title game .I think it s too soon to try to attribute it to anything , said Bill Hancock , the College Football Playoff s executive director . There will be time later to talk about all those numbers .Hancock added : Today is a day to reflect on a tremendous football season . Millions of people watched . If there was a slight decline in the ratings , it doesn t overshadow what happened in that stadium ( Monday ) night .Saban s concerns were of a slightly different nature . He noted the Crimson Tide s week spent in the Dallas area while preparing for the Cotton Bowl , which although a Playoff semifinal also was a traditional bowl experience ? complete with extracurricular activities such as hospital visits and team outings ? and then traveled to Arizona for a stripped down but similar experience in the run up to the national title game .I think it s a great venue . I m not complaining , Saban said . But it s just difficult . You don t have that circumstance in the NFL . You play home and away games when you re in the ( NFL ) playoffs .This whole dynamic of how do we keep a healthy bowl system , which I think is great for college football . It s great for a lot of positive self gratification for a lot of players who had a good season , and the national interest we have in a playoff , which sort of overwhelms the importance of all the other bowl games .Hancock touted the overall bowl system , including the Playoff , the other four New Year s Six bowls and the 34 other bowls , and said it continues to be a great experience for the players .We intentionally fit the playoff in the bowl system , Hancock said . I think that was the wise thing to do .

WASHINGTON , DC White House officials announced Monday that representatives from the U . S . will join those from Sweden , Russia , and the U . N . in the Mideast next week to sight see , sunbathe , and mediate peace talks between Palestine and Israel ." A few weeks ago , President Bush asked me to go to the West Bank and work on the road map to peace , " an excited Secretary of State Colin Powell said . " There ' s absolutely no chance that these talks will ever work , but I was like , ' Free trip to the disputed zone ? No way I ' m gonna turn that down ! ' "Powell said that , while the all expense paid trip is ostensibly to broker terms for a move toward the creation of a Palestinian state along with guarantees for a halt to attacks against Israel , he expects to have plenty of time " to just kick around and enjoy the area . "" Turns out we have talks all day Monday and Tuesday , but Wednesday is almost completely open , " Powell said . " The March 14 bombings at Ashdod Port supposedly have security crazy on alert , but I think I ' ll recruit a couple extra bodyguards , outfit a little six vehicle convoy , and head on over to Gaza to check out the scene . The Strip is generally pretty chilled out during the week , I ' ve heard . "Several of the more than two dozen diplomats slated to attend have said that they hold low expectations for the peace talks , but are looking forward to enjoying some free time in the exotic locale ." A lot of people in the EU are angry with Washington policy makers , claiming that Bush ' s endorsement of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ' s proposed unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip rejects the right of Palestinian refugees to return to disputed land now in Israeli control but I don ' t care to take sides while on this trip , " High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy for the EU Javier Solana said . " I heard Colin ' s going , and I figure , if Col ' s there , it ' ll be a good time . I ' d like to sneak away with him some evening and find out how the remaining members of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra sound . "" I hope they put us all up at the Dan Panorama hotel like they did last time , " Solana added . " If it hasn ' t been razed by a stray missile , that is . "Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar ( R IN ) applied to attend the negotiations , but his request was denied due to budget constraints ." This sucks , " Lugar said . " They ' re sending Solana but not me ? I deserve to go so much more than that guy . Powell , okay , he ' s been around forever , but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov gets to go ? How ' d Lavrov get in line ahead of me for this trip ? I am so briefed on the situation with those state sanctioned killings of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi . Colin had better bring me something back some spent shell casings or one of those kitschy religious fanatic posters . "Paula J . Dobriansky , State Department Undersecretary for Global Affairs , said that no offense was meant to Lugar , but the roster filled up very quickly ." Everyone wants to get over there to see the historic mosque and temple architecture , taste the delicious Mediterranean food , and experience the local culture of the Middle East , no matter what protective body armor is required , " Dobriansky said . " Jerusalem is supposed to be just gorgeous in the springtime . Everyone who makes it back here alive won ' t stop talking about it . "Although several U . N . delegates expressed skepticism about the outcome of the talks , their reservations did not dull their enthusiasm for visiting the attractions ." These talks could theoretically be really important to the region , so I hope they go well , " said Terje Roed Larsen , U . N . Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process . " On the other hand , if negotations do break down , we can spend the week shopping in the couple of cool , out of the way parts of Tel Aviv that are still accessible to tourists . And , well , should everything fall to pieces , it would be great to not have to worry about rushing through those 40 checkpoints to make it back in time for a meeting . "Bush will not attend the talks due to a previously scheduled trip to Baghdad to oversee the preparations for Iraqi sovereignty . According to an anonymous White House insider , Major General John Batiste has been instructed to use his command of the 1st Infantry Division to secure the area around the Samarra spiral minaret near Fallujah so the pair can get their photo taken in front of the ornate , historic building . 	 1
This year s holiday season started off with outrage over coffee cups . But while some took to complaining about what was or wasn ' t printed on their 5 drink , others were fighting to spend Thanksgiving with our families .With all the media coverage of the so called War on Christmas , there is a more important and real battle happening in America today : the war on workers .5 OF THE WORST THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ON BLACK FRIDAYI m a nine year employee of Target , one of the largest retailers in the country . While I m thankful for my job , retail chains do not have a good track record of treating their employees right . Many go without benefits or earning a living wage . Many are forced to be part time but must give full time availability and can be called in at any moment , making getting a second job to pay the bills next to impossible .On top of it all , over the last couple years , retailers have tried to take away traditions like spending Thanksgiving with family .When Target recently announced Thanksgiving hours to the public , Tina Tyler , our executive vice president and chief stores officer , said , It felt good to us last year to be able to allow those family traditions to take place around Thanksgiving , but also let shopping be part of it .Sorry . Shopping isn t a Thanksgiving tradition . Working on Thanksgiving shouldn t be a tradition , either .RETAILERS WHO ' VE BEEN THE MOST NAUGHTY AND NICE THIS HOLIDAYStay home . Eat turkey . Talk to your family .Every day , that is , but Thanksgiving . Which is why I m petitioning for Target to stand up for its employees and close on Thanksgiving .People are signing on , and the pressure seems to be having an affect . For the first time in four years , Target and other retailers aren t opening earlier than they were the year before . While it s not the victory we want , it s a step in the right direction .Meantime , other retail giants are making the opposite statement . REI , P . C . Richard Son , Staples , GameStop , H M and others have all announced they wouldn t open on Thanksgiving .My coworkers and I hope that Target is the next store to push back against the shopping frenzy . The shoppers will still be there when we open on Black Friday the time with our family will not .While staying open or closing on one day may seem small in the scheme of things , I don t see it that way at all . Closing on Thanksgiving sends a basic message that I as an employee matter . It says workers like me are respected by those they work for day in and day out . It means there is hope that the war on workers will end .When an employer commits to one action that shows they respect their workers , it leads to workers being more loyal and productive . That one act can then turn into another . Today it s closing on Thanksgiving , tomorrow it s better wages .Zeilman is a New Jersey resident and employee of Target . His Change . org petition calling on his employer to close on Thanksgiving has gained 98 , 000 signatures and counting in support . 	 0
PHILADELPHIA At first glance , Randy Grebcyk appears to be like any other male . An associate underwriter for Mid Atlantic Colonial Insurance , Grebcyk , 29 , works a 40 hour week and lives alone in a one bedroom apartment . What sets Grebcyk apart from other males , however , is an unusual lack of shyness and a strong desire for self expression qualities that surprise those who meet him , and leave scientists scrambling for explanation .Psychologists studying Grebcyk have coined a term , " extroversion , " to describe his unusual behavior ." It ' s completely baffling , " said MIT researcher Edmund Lawler . " As we all know , men are normally very reticent and reluctant to share their opinions or thoughts . I myself would prefer to be hiding under my desk right now . But this Grebcyk fellow breaks the mold . He ' s quite an anomaly . "As Grebcyk himself put it : " Whoo hoo ! AC DC rules ! Chevy sucks ! "Most males are by nature content with a quiet , contemplative life , spending their days baking , quilting and meditating thoughtfully . Venturing out in public takes no small degree of coaxing and self resolve . Not so with Grebcyk .At any given moment and without warning , Grebcyk is capable of such unorthodox actions as : initiating a conversation with a total stranger telling an off color joke and emitting high pitched whooping noises .Or , as Grebcyk recently said , " Yeah ! Fifth row tickets , baby ! Sweet ! "Researchers have isolated five basic elements through which Grebcyk ' s unusual traits find their expression : pro football , " classic " rock , alcoholic beverages , the opposite sex , and automobiles .For example , Grebcyk recently won Philadelphia Eagles tickets on a drive time show on his favorite sports radio station , WDUG , " The Dugout . " As a " huge fan " of the Eagles , Grebcyk was ecstatic , and in the days leading up to the game he could not stop talking about how he had won the tickets , as well as how he had gotten to say " WDUG kicks ass " on the air .At the game , Grebcyk drew stares and gasps of admiration by appearing shirtless , with one side of his body painted green and the other side white ." What a delightful , not at all annoying young man , " said Shirley Post , 51 , who sat near Grebcyk at the game .Not surprisingly , Grebcyk wants to put his unusual traits to gainful use . He would like someday to become a " stand up comedian , " a person who tells jokes to elicit laughter from others . Grebcyk said he was influenced by his hero , Andrew " Dice " Clay , a comedian who exhibited extroversion similar to Grebcyk ' s before his career decline in the early 1990s ." You hear what happened when Michael Jackson ' s wife got pregnant ? " Grebcyk quipped . " He was the one who got morning sickness . "Scientists still cannot find a cause for Grebcyk ' s unique extroversion . But whatever the cause , everyone agrees that his future is bright ." I predict big things for Randy , " said Jennifer Kessler , his supervisor at Mid Atlantic . " Such unusual exuberance should be well rewarded , and I think it will be . " 	 1
WASHINGTON Sen . Barack Obama said Thursday that the most important thing he could achieve as president would be to deal with Iraq and the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan while improving " our influence around the world . "Sen . Barack Obama , in his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , speaks with Wolf Blitzer .In his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , Obama said he thinks the United States ' influence around the world has been diminishing ." I think there is still a sense everywhere I go that if the United States regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals , that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world . " Watch the full interview with ObamaObama said he thinks the way the war in Iraq has been handled has kept the United States from focusing on key issues like energy policy , global warming and the economy .Americans want to succeed , he said , " but we ' re going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the American people is released . "" It ' s very hard for us to do that when we ' re spending close to 200 billion a year in other countries , rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong , " he said .Obama downplayed headlines and stories , such as the cover of Time magazine , that have declared him the Democratic presidential nominee ." I don ' t want to be jinxed . We ' ve still got some work to do , " he said . Watch an analysis of some of Obama ' s commentsObama predicted that he and Sen . Hillary Clinton would probably split the remaining contests and said Clinton would win the upcoming primary in West Virginia by a " big margin . "Obama won North Carolina by a 14 point margin Tuesday . Clinton squeaked out a win in Indiana by 2 points .In the days after those contests , some top Democrats have called on Clinton to step aside .Obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the New York senator , saying it ' s too early to start thinking about running mates ." Sen . Clinton has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate . She ' s tireless , she ' s smart , she ' s capable , and so obviously she ' d be on anybody ' s short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate , " he said . " But it would be presumptuous of me at this point . . . to somehow suggest that she should be my running mate . " Watch viewer responses to question : Should Obama offer Clinton the No . 2 spot ?Terry McAuliffe , a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a co chairman of Clinton ' s campaign , commented Thursday on the possibility of a joint ticket ." I think what she ' s interested in being the nominee of the party . . . . We ' re fighting hard for it . This woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign . . . . Hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do . "Obama said he ' s ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee : a matchup against Sen . John McCain , the presumptive GOP candidate .Obama said he was offended when McCain said last month , " It ' s very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president . "" I think it ' s disappointing because John McCain always says , ' Well , I ' m not going to run that kind of politics , ' and then to engage in that kind of smear I think is unfortunate , particularly since my policy on Hamas has been no different than his , " Obama said ." And so for him to toss out comments like that , I think , is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination . "When asked to respond to McCain supporters such as former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney who have said Obama is not ready to be commander in chief , the senator from Illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is " good judgment . "" I think I ' ve consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the American people are looking for in the next president , " he said . Watch Obama say why he ' s qualified to be presidentRomney responded later on " The Situation Room , " saying " The truth of the matter is just as I said , that he doesn ' t have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector . . . hasn ' t pushed a major piece of legislation ." He seems like a charming guy who ' s very well spoken . But in terms of actually having led , actually having accomplished something , actually having a kind of leadership that America needs at a critical time with our economy . . . he ' s untested . . . . Frankly , Sen . McCain is someone who is tested and very proven , " he added . 	 0

Alan Miliburn , the government ' s social mobility adviser , said the middle classes , as well as those on low incomes , struggle to make it to the topMiddle class children are being held back by ' entrenched elitism ' which means the rich and privately educated are a third more likely to get top jobs , a government adviser warned today .Alan Milburn , the social mobility tsar , said it was not just children from poorer families who struggled to ' move up and get on ' .In the latest high profile attack on the privileged elite who run Britain , he said it was time to ' break open the closed shop ' at the top of society .David Cameron has been stung by criticism of the wealthy background of many in the Cabinet .Former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major took a swipe last month , warning the Conservatives cannot win if they fail to understand the ' silent have nots ' who suffer in ' net curtain poverty ' .New research from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission found that privately educated graduates are one third more likely to get top jobs than state school educated graduates .In a speech today Mr Miliburn said : ' A society where opportunities are frozen rather than fluid hurts more than those at the very bottom end .' It hurts the people President Clinton once famously called the " forgotten middle class " .' They , and not just low income families , are the victims of entrenched elitism in our country . 'The former Labour Cabinet minister told social mobility experts that the problem did not affect just people from working class backgrounds , but was also a block on the aspirations of middle class families .Part of this gap was explained by the fact that top employers continue to recruit from a narrow range of highly selective universities , where those who went to independent schools tend to be over represented , said the Commission .Research shows the increased probability of working in a top job if privately educate , compared with attending a state schoolBut it also found that even where two similarly qualified graduates have attended the same university and got the same degree , a privately schooled graduate is still 8 per cent more likely to get a top job than a state schooled one .Mr Milburn added : ' Social mobility relies on people across the income spectrum being able to move up and get on .' We have a twin problem in our country : middle class aspirations and working class opportunities to advance are both being thwarted . 'Commission analysis suggested that some of the career advantage for privately educated graduates comes from having social connections that state educated graduates are less likely to enjoy . But it found that most of the gap is unexplained .10 . 5 of all graduates work in a top professional job , while privately educated graduates are 6 percentage points more likely than state school graduates to work in these jobsMr Milburn said the expansion of the middle classes would help more people to break through into the top of society .He said : ' A twin solution is needed : we need to break open the closed shop at the top of British society and expand the middle .' It should be our country ' s ambition to create a bigger middle class with more avenues for advancement . A growing middle class is the foundation for a more mobile country . 'Mr Milburn outlined a five point policy agenda , involving expanding early years education paying the best teachers more for working in disadvantaged areas opening up universities to a wider pool of talent and making vocational education a national priority increasing the minimum wage and expanding entry to the professions by getting firms to recruit from a wider range of universities and ending unpaid internships . 	 0
ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that a'superhead'close to former education secretary michael gove knew about inspections weeks in advance. sir michael wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said fresh emails have come to light regarding three norfolk schools all overseen by dame rachel de souza. the academies involved in the allegations are ormiston victory academy in norwich, thetford academy and great yarmouth primary. ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that'superhead'dame rachel de souza knew about inspections at three schools weeks in advanceby law, schools can only be given half a day's notice of an inspection, but in august it was claimed the schools knew days, sometimes even weeks, before inspectors were due to visit. in a statement, sir michael said :'the ongoing claims that have been made about certain schools in norfolk being given advance notice of ofsted inspections are very serious.'it is vital that the public has absolute confidence in the integrity of the inspection process. that is why i immediately asked sir robin bosher to examine these allegations when they first surfaced in august.'sir robin conducted a thorough investigation, which included 39 interviews with relevant parties and visits to the three academies in question. but i made a public commitment that should any additional evidence come to light, i would have no hesitation in bringing in someone from outside ofsted to examine this. sir michael wilshaw ( left ), the chief inspector of schools, said emails have come to light regarding allegations about de souza who was executive of the inspiration trust, which at the time oversaw all three academiesms de souza was principal of the ormiston victory academy and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by ofsted, and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated'for the avoidance of any doubt, i will be asking this independent reviewer to examine all the evidence originally considered by sir robin and to establish whether his findings and recommendations still stand in the light of the new email evidence that has now emerged.'the announcement came after the observer presented ofsted with a further set of emails which suggested de souza discussed the timing of inspections with members of the inspectorate. in an email conversation between de souza and a consultant for the inspiration trust maggie hollingsworth in july 2013, they discuss an inspection date for larkman primary in norwich. ms de souza says she is due to meet the deputy director of ofsted in the east of england, paul brooker, that evening. the allegations are also thought to include thetford academy in norfolk, also overseen by the'superhead'and in another email exchange with a department for education official in may 2014, de souza claims she has received a promise of an inspection in the autumn from brooker. ms de souza writes :'between us paul has promised they'll come back in autumn but what a waste of time really and if it can happen to me then imagine schools with less experience'the original report into the claims was carried out by ofsted's director of quality and training, sir robin bosher. it concluded dame rachel de souza, chief executive of the inspiration trust, which at the time oversaw all three academies, was mistakenly copied into an email containing an inspection schedule. a spokesman for dame rachel de souza said :'these emails are being quoted out of context. in both cases, dame rachel was following ofsted guidelines and any suggestion that she was lobbying ofsted improperly is false.'in the first email to an educational consultant, she discussed an potential ofsted inspection of larkman primary school, which was in the process of being taken over and converted into norwich primary academy by the inspiration trust to improve educational attainment. ofsted's guidance recognises that in these circumstances, with a change of leadership, an inspection may not be appropriate.'in the interest of transparency and ensuring the change happened in the best interest of pupils and parents, dame rachel explained the situation to ofsted and they noted her views.'however, in line with their regulations, hmi on behalf of ofsted did not divulge what effect this information would have on their decision whether or not to inspect the school.'in the second email, dame rachel expressed her disappointment with the result of an inspection, which rated great yarmouth primary as good with outstanding leadership.'she had hoped to show it was an outstanding school, but ofsted indicated that one of the key factors they could not award that rating was the fact that exam results were not yet available.'dame rachel considered requesting a second inspection to confirm high or improving standards, and it was confirmed to her by paul brooker that she was entitled to do so under ofsted's rules. in the event, this second inspection was not requested. again, this is entirely normal practice and in line with ofsted rules.'we welcome the independent review of the original ofsted investigation announced by sir michael wilshaw, which we are confident will 	 0

ORLANDO , FL Noting that the show had simply appeared on the park ' s schedule last week without an announcement or fanfare of any kind , visitors to SeaWorld told reporters Thursday that the theme park ' s latest attraction consists solely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water with no explanation .The most recent addition to the amusement park ' s slate of entertainment listed on brochures and signs simply as " Elephant Drowning reportedly features an adult African elephant that is led out by trainers into the main amphitheater , where it is immediately shoved into a 36 foot deep aquarium and left to slowly die , all without the music , lighting cues , or narration that typically accompany other SeaWorld shows ." After they pushed it into the pool , it swam around for a little while , which was cool because I didn ' t even know elephants could swim , but then it started really struggling to keep its head above water , " said visitor Katie Hayes , 32 , who attended the 1 p . m . Elephant Drowning performance with her family after seeing a sign advertising the show simply as " SeaWorld ' s Newest Experience . " " My kids were cheering for it at first , and we all thought it might do some tricks or something . But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time , trying to get out of there . "" And then it drowned , " Hayes added ." Our new show offers the same first rate entertainment you ' ve come to expect from SeaWorld , and it ' s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages . "Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced , silently forced the full grown elephant into the tank , and then walked out through the backstage door , all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way . Additionally , many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring , or at least mention the elephant ' s name , but noted that no one ever did .Over the course of the half hour show , the 12 , 000 pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked , making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure . Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank ' s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself ." It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point , which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety , which would have been incredible but nope , " said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern , 22 , who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced , given the animal ' s continuous , ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass . " Eventually , the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling , trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely . "" I really wasn ' t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule , " she added . " But , yeah , it was pretty much just an elephant drowning . "Visitors said that following some violent , last ditch floundering , the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed . Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank , where it came to rest in a heap , its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling ." No one really told us when the show was over , " said season pass holder Mariam O ' Neill , 57 . " After the elephant didn ' t move for a while , people got up and started leaving . A few people stuck around for the Clyde Seamore ' s Sea Lion High show , which was coming up next . "According to sources , the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well attended since its introduction earlier this month , with the Saturday afternoon show in particular , which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf , regularly filling to capacity .When reached for comment , SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park ' s website ." SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand new attraction to its visitors , " company representative Nancy Klemmer said . " Our new show offers the same first rate entertainment you ' ve come to expect from SeaWorld , and it ' s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages . "" Plus , the elephants absolutely love it , " Klemmer added . 	 1

AQABA , JORDAN In an agreement that marks a key first step in the Mideast news piece process , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and new Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas pledged to share a two state Israeli and Palestinian headline Monday ." This pact shows that Palestinians and Israelis can and will commit to sharing the column inch space devoted to the Middle East region , " said New York Times executive editor Joseph Lelyveld , who mediated the Jordan summit . " Given the state of affairs in the area , I am confident that we will see more headlines uniting these two countries in the future . "Under the terms of the agreement , Palestinians and Israelis will commit to " sharing together , side by side , a real and substantive presence " in the global foreign disaster based news media . The shared headline commitment extends to news about massacres throughout Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip territories , and covers both the destruction of Palestinian homes by Israeli air to surface rocket attacks and the killing of Israeli women and children in suicide bombing campaigns by Palestinian extremists . Although foreign correspondents said they regarded the agreement as a step forward , they stressed that it is only the beginning ." From the 1979 Broadcast News Coverage Accord between Egypt and Israel to the 1989 Summit On Font Point Size Minimums with the PLO , we have all heard this sort of thing before , " said reporter Jeffrey Douglas Miles of the London Times . " Can a successful end to more than 50 years of bloody conflict over headline domination be achieved in a single day ? No . But this development is a positive one . There have been five more deaths in the region since Sunday , all of them newsworthy . "Given the region ' s history of violent headline grabbing on both sides , the new agreement ' s limitations are many .Historically , negotiations over the wording of joint headlines have been complicated by both groups ' insistence on being portrayed as victims . In the latest round of talks , Abbas has okayed depictions of the intifada as an uprising of people oppressed by a modern apartheid state of superior military and economic strength , but will not allow portrayals of all Palestinian dissidents as fundamentalist terrorists .Similarly , Sharon agreed to allow headline space describing Israel as a lone democratic state fighting to defend itself from constant attack , and will permit descriptions of Jews as victims of millennia of anti Semitism . Sharon did not agree , however , to be portrayed as a hard line hawk who repeatedly sabotages attempts at peace by moderates on both sides of the conflict .No agreement was reached concerning reportage describing either side as unethical , racist , or oppressive ." We will concede the necessity of a shared Israeli Palestinian headline accompanied by a photo of civilian parents mourning recently killed children caught in the crossfire , " Sharon said . " But no concessions regarding media depiction of Palestinian victimhood will be tolerated unless a commitment to Israeli victimhood is also maintained . "Abbas echoed this stance ." Portrayals of Israeli victimization in the world media must only continue if equal headline space for the victimization of Arabs can be guaranteed by the press , " Abbas said . " If such conditions can be met , headlines about explosions , machine gunning crowds , religious death cults that manipulate children into suicide attacks on innocents , economic deprivation , religious discrimination , race based subjugation , and needless human tragedy can continue to be generated equally by both Israelis and Palestinians well into our children ' s children ' s future . "The first proposed shared headline , " Israeli , Palestinian Death Toll Mounts , " could appear in newspapers worldwide as early as Thursday .No agreement was reached involving the peaceable sharing of land . 	 1
They have plagued feet for centuries , but only now have physicists revealed what causes ingrown nails .Experts have come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow .They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place , and their rate of growth , become unbalanced .Experts have come up with mathematical formulae that describe how nails grow . These graphs show how the tilt of the nail changes when the adhesive molecules are not working efficiently ( C ) , the probability that a bond is not keeping up with nail growth ( D ) and a representation of the force generated by a nail ( E )Other factors , such as the thickness of the nail , biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails , influences their chances of getting ingrown nails .The University of Nottingham study solves a long running mystery about why ingrown nails occur .Nails are made of dead skin cells , which are hardened by a protein called keratin .They grow outwards from the half moon shaped ' lunala ' at the base of the nail , but their progress of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2mm a day is kept in check by adhesive molecules that ' stick ' the nail to the finger , Popsci reported .They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place , and their rate of growth , become unbalanced . When this happens , a nail becomes wider at the top and curls round into the sensitive flesh to either side of the nail . Big toenails are prone to becoming ingrown because of their shapeScientists looked at the mechanical stresses and energies associated with the nail , to come up with equations to explain nail growth .They show that when the balance between the nail ' s growth stress and adhesive stress is broken if a nail grows too quickly or slowly , or the number of adhesive structures changes a residual stress across the entire nail can occur , causing it to change shape over time .The equations demonstrate that residual stress can occur in any fingernail or toenail however , the stress is greater for nails that are larger in size and have a flatter edge , which explains why ingrown toe nails predominantly occur in the big toe .Experts say that the tiny , microscopic structures , which allow the nail to slide forwards , grow in a ' ratchet like ' fashion by continuously binding and unbinding to a nail .If the balance between adhesion and growth becomes unbalanced , the nail changes shape , and can become ingrown or spoon shaped , according to research published in the journal , Physical Biology .Ingrown nails often occur in children , teenagers and pregnant women , when hormones cause a growth spurt of the nails , which extend into the sensitive flesh alongside them .Cyril Rauch , lead author of the study at the University of Nottingham , said that big toenails are particularly prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape .Scientists say that people should trim their nails in a ' parabola shape ' to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails . They warned that poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails , causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail , making problems like ingrown nails more likelyTheir squareness means stress caused by walking is diverted to the tip of the nail , which gets wider to spread the load .The scientist says that people should trim their nails in a ' parabola shape ' to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails .Dr Rauch warns that regular poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails , causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail .' We suggest that nail beauty fanatics who trim their nails on a daily basis opt for straight or parabolic edges , as otherwise they may amplify the imbalance of stresses which could lead to a number of serious conditions , ' he says . 	 0
Tiger Woods sizzled at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational . With the season ' s final major a week away , his timing is good .Woods equaled his career best round on the PGA Tour and matched his own course record in Ohio by shooting a 61 , hitting an eagle , seven birdies and not dropping a shot .He also shot a nine under par 61 in the second round of the tournament in 2000 the year he outclassed his rivals and claimed three majors .But Woods hasn ' t won a major in five years now , stuck on 14 , and struggled on the final day of the British Open last month when he was in contention .The Bridgestone Invitational was the world No . 1 ' s first tournament since Muirfield , and he began with an impressive 66 .He bettered that on Friday at a tournament he has captured seven times , beginning with a birdie , eagle and birdie to set the tone . Woods shot the first nine in 30 ." I just let the round build from there , " Woods said in a television interview aired by Sky Sports . " I made a couple of key putts for pars . Things like that happen today . "The back nine started just as well , with Woods registering four straight birdies . He was nine under through 13 holes .With a sub 60 round in his sights , though , Woods shot at par the rest of the way , narrowly missing a birdie on the 17th but then avoiding a bogey on the 18th with a stunning putt .He leads defending champion Keegan Bradley and England ' s Chris Wood by seven shots ."

spencer, ia the toy section of the fleet road goodwill, with its heartbreaking assortment of soiled, broken, bargain priced playthings, depressed an estimated 20 shoppers tuesday. " look at this one, " said spencer resident bobbie perrin, 43, gingerly picking up a grimy stuffed animal with her fingertips. " judging from the'kennel kritters'tag, it must be a knock off of one of those pound puppies from the'80s, only i'm pretty sure those had legs. " " oh my god, are those tomato soup stains on its back? " asked perrin, flinging the kennel kritter back into a large bin, where it landed between a plastic horse and a faded parcheesi game board. " i thought those were spots. " the bin, whose items were priced at 50 cents each, also contained a chewed rawhide dog bone, a rubik's cube with the stickers peeled off and sloppily reapplied, a broken laser pointer key chain, a nude skipper doll, a deflated minnesota vikings plastic football, a ziploc bag containing five teddy ruxpin cassettes and a crayon, and a " bendie " policeman with wires poking out of its joints. perrin, who had come to the store looking for black pants for her daughter's waitress uniform, said she took a detour into the toy section seeking a small, impromptu gift for her neighbor's 4 year old child. instead, perrin was confronted with a profoundly sad menagerie of unwanted toys. " this is the kind of stuff you wouldn't pick up if it were lying on the side of the road, " perrin said. " yet, somehow, it's being presented for sale as merchandise. i guess if you can't afford to buy your child a new frisbee for 3, you can get a dirty 25 cent one here. " " i'm going home to lie down, " perrin added. " i feel awful. " perrin is not the only customer nearly brought to tears by the toys. liza robichaud, 22, who periodically visits the goodwill store to shop for drinking glasses and vintage'80s t shirts, passed through the section on her way to the bathroom. " the toy area has its own distinct odor : sort of a musty, mildewy, plastic, sour milk, baby vomit, metallic, rotting cloth smell, " robichaud said. " it isn't quite the smell of evil just despair. " scanning the shelves of misfit games and books, robichaud sighed deeply. " i need to go wash my hands, " robichaud said. " i really shouldn't have touched that leaky magic 8 ball. " corey litt, a 21 year old college student, was similarly shaken. " this stuff's in such bad shape, it's hard to even enjoy it for the kitsch factor, " litt said. " i saw a can of lincoln logs over there and got excited. but when i opened it, there were only, like, three or four logs and a bunch of other crap a tinkertoy wheel with gum stuck in the holes, about a dozen bent uno cards, a pair of lens less sunglasses, a couple jigsaw puzzle pieces, a marble, and a bicycle reflector. " making the toy section all the more depressing, experts say, is the high percentage of promotional toys from fast food restaurants and cereal boxes. " on the ladder of toy desirability, promotional toys are the lowest rung, " said daniel nestor, author of bins of despair. " they are the shoddiest and, by virtue of their promotional nature, most dated and disposable. a child who finds a mcdonald's action figure of an asian warrior at goodwill is highly unlikely to recognize him as a character from mulan, and it would take a movie trivia whiz of the highest order to know that his name is captain li shang. removed from the context of the movie and the corresponding happy meal box, the toy becomes that much more pitiful and obsolete than its non promotional counterpart. " because the toys are in such poor shape when they arrive at goodwill, there is little incentive for the store's staff to take good care of them. as a result, their condition worsens, leading to an endless degradation spiral : the dirtier the toys become, the less likely they are to be bought. in turn, the longer they remain in the store, the dirtier they become. " somehow, even the saggy diapered 2 year olds left to entertain themselves with the toys sense their lack of value, " nestor said. " they fling them around with abandon, banging them against each other with little fear of doing harm to the chipped alphabet blocks, sticky film covered mega blok 	 1

" two followers of islamic state attacked several days ago a center in san bernardino in california, " the group reported on its al bayan daily broadcast, according to reuters. but the islamic state, also known as isil or isis,? stopped short of claiming responsibility for the violence. the islamic state report praised the attack, but did not characterize syad farook, 28, and his wife, tashfeen malik, 27, as? members of the? group. u. s. officials reported friday that malik had pledged support for isil and its leader, abu bakr al baghdadi, in a posting on facebook immediately before she and her husband opened fire on a holiday party at the inland regional center in san bernardino wednesday. both later died in a gun battle with law enforcement after they tried to flee in a black suv. the pledge of support to al baghdadi is not the first case of this happening in a terror incident in the united states.? in may, elton simpson, one of two islamic state sympathizers killed during an attempted attack in garland,? texas, pledged his loyalty to al baghdadi in a tweet immediately before the incident. simpson and an accomplice were carrying assault weapons and wearing body armor as they tried to enter a location where there was a contest? featuring depictions of the prophet mohammed. fbi director james comey said friday that the shooting spree, which also injured 21,? was being treated as a " federal terrorist investigation, " but that there was no indication the couple were part of a cell or network or being directed by any group. president obama, in his weekly radio address saturday, said " it is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror. and if so, it would underscore a threat we've been focused on for years?? the danger of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies. " considerable attention is being focused on malik, who was born in pakistan and entered the u. s. on a fiancee visa last year, according to the fbi. the new york times reported saturday that she passed two rounds of criminal and national security background checks before obtaining the visa and a resident green card. malik first connected with farook online and they met when he traveled to saudi arabia, and then he brought her to the usa in 2014. the two were married in riverside county in august, 2014, according to the associated press. farook, who was an environmental health specialist,? was born in the usa. the lawyers for his family described malik? friday as a?

An inquest into the recent " poor handling " of the recent local flooding which was dealing with the local council and the local water authority took a bizarre turn as it received a surprise visit and testimony from the God of Thunder Thor this Thursday .The inquest had been staggering on for several weeks beforehand reaching no conclusion whatsoever with everyone involved neatly avoiding or downright denying any responsibility or culpability for the mayhem caused . The continually ongoing and " hard fact backed " accusations of " non existent crisis management " made at the council and " under equipped and poorly maintained drainage " made at the water company when the proceedings where interrupted literally from a bolt from the blue and the appearance a visage of a bearded man who had the appearance of a VikingInitially the inquest was uncertain what to make of this occurrence and it was only when Mr Thor identified himself several times , assumed a human form and stopped speaking in a loud booming voice did the court resume some kind of normality .It was at this point that Mr Thor revealed that he was in fact partially to blame for the recent flooding . He confessed to the inquest that he had been " mightily upset by recent events in his tangled and complex love life " and had gone out and expressed his frustration the only way he knew how by " making it rain as hard and as long as he could " .Mr Thor expressed deep regret at the damage the excessive amount of water had caused and offered to make reparations however the inquest saw fit .Both the water company and the local council wasted no time in dismissing themselves from the proceedings and any responsibility , culpability , action or reparation citing that there was no a clear and actual defined case of the flooding being " an act of god " .It was also announced soon after this revelation from Mr Thor that additionally any insurance company worth its name would not be paying anyone affected a single penny in damages whatsoever for exactly the same reason .A local trading standards officer expressed no surprise at these subsequent developments : " Its no surprise the council , the water company and any insurance company has acted in the way they have , in all honesty they normally do the same in any case it just so happens this time round there ' s is actual proof that it truly was an act of god . "Mr Thor has been given a sentence of community service which consists of repairing any damage that his flood caused a sentence which Mr Thor readily agreed to and made good on .An affected resident was astonished at the good news " normally we just get more or less told to get lost by the council , water company and insurance companies in a roundabout sneaky way that absolves them of responsibility of course . But this time , we are actually going to get our houses repaired which is great news . "Mr Thor has also promised to no longer deluge the local area in the future . Nevertheless , he did express some concern about the location of the town being right next to the sea , backing onto a river on reclaimed land that was actually below sea level . Considering the drainage is only able to accept approximately 2cm of water per square foot , while the average rainfall is over 20cm and no disaster strategy in place it is no surprise the events happened as they did . When asked to further comment on this he said " lord what fools these mortals be . " 	 1
Three missing British schoolgirls who fled to Syria to join Islamic State were last night believed to be in a house in the city of Raqqa .Shamima Begum , 15 , Kadiza Sultana , 16 , and 15 year old Amira Abase went missing two weeks ago after boarding a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul .The girls are believed to have crossed from Turkey to Syria through the town of Arai . Yesterday Sky News reporter Stuart Ramsay said : ' We are told by very good sources in Raqqa that they are there and that they are under the control of Islamic State . 'Missing : The three British schoolgirls , Shamima Begum , 15 , Kadiza Sultana , 16 , and 15 year old Amira Abase , are believed to be in a house in the city of Raqqa after going missing two weeks agoHe also revealed that they were staying with a British girl thought to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined IS .The 15 year old student , the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London , has not been identified by the authorities .Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls ' families explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend ' s disappearance had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents .Fled London : Amira Abase , 15 , is among the trio believed to have flown from Gatwick to IstanbulMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan Howe admitted that ' with the benefit of hindsight ' officers should have communicated directly with the families .But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology .However Abase Hussein , the father of Amira , said his daughter would still be at home if he had seen the warning .' If we knew , this wouldn ' t have happened , ' he said , adding : ' We would have discussed it and taken away their passports . 'And Halima Khanom , sister of Kadiza , said : ' We wouldn ' t have been here today if we ' d got that letter and known what was going on . 'At least 22 young women are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months . Scotland Yard has said the investigation into all the missing girls continues .Sir Bernard yesterday warned that girls lured to Syria by IS faced sex abuse at the hands of ' deeply misogynistic ' militants .He said British jihadi brides were oblivious to the reality of life under the terror group and will be powerless to escape once they arrive . 	 0
NEW YORK Promising to cover the event responsibly and with the kind of delicate restraint it deserves , the nation ' s cable news outlets announced Monday that while they would be devoting some airtime to the 10th anniversary of 9 11 , they " certainly wouldn ' t be going overboard with it . "According to the news providers , they only intend to devote 15 minutes of coverage to the anniversary , tops , saying it is their obligation as professional journalists to do justice to the victims ' memories as opposed to using the occasion for their own ratings gain .In addition , network representatives admitted it would be lazy news reporting to use the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks as an excuse to fill up hundreds of hours of programming with repetitive video packages and anchors repeatedly asking their guests , " How did 9 11 change America ? "" We ' re planning to send one reporter to Ground Zero , have him tape a couple of two minute segments , nothing too crazy , and that should pretty much do it , " said CNN ' s senior vice president of programming Katherine Green , adding that the 24 hour news channel would not be making 9 11 the focus of every single program on the network because , according to Green , " What more is there to say , really ? " " We ' ll also briefly check in with Anderson Cooper at the Pentagon , and that will be the only time we hear from him during the entirety of our coverage . "" Then our plan is to do what other American cable news providers presumably will be doing , " she added . " We ' ll go back to reporting that never panders to viewers , but instead challenges them and forces them to step outside their own bubble by making them aware of all the truly newsworthy events happening in the world . "Along with Green , representatives from MSNBC , CNBC , HLN , and Fox News immediately ruled out doing an entire week of pre anniversary coverage , calling it a waste of time , resources , and potentially exploitative to family members who lost a loved one on 9 11 .The networks also said they would not be designing an " America Remembers " graphic to be constantly plastered across the bottom third of the television screen wouldn ' t even think about conducting " trite , unoriginal , and what basically amounts to filler " man on the street interviews that ask citizens where they were on 9 11 and , calling it " sensationalism just for the sake of sensationalism , " wouldn ' t repeatedly show archived footage of airplanes colliding into the Twin Towers and New Yorkers running away from the collapsed buildings .Sources at Fox News confirmed that at no time during their coverage would they use the anniversary as an excuse to paint the Obama administration as weak on terrorism ." I would imagine some might think that because it ' s the 10th anniversary , we would latch on to the whole ' 10th ' aspect and blow it completely out of proportion , " MSNBC national news director Derrick Lipton said . " But we ' re smarter than that . Our viewers are smarter than that . If anything , we ' ll maybe cut back to Ground Zero when Presidents Obama and Bush leave the memorial service . And then maybe we ' ll have Tom Brokaw on to talk about what it was like covering the event 10 years ago . If we do that , we ' ll probably do commercial bumpers where we show images of the two beams of blue light shining up into the night sky , footage of Bush with his bullhorn saying , " Well , I can hear you , " and maybe something that represents the human side of the tragedy , like people tacking up pictures of their loved ones . That ' s it . But then I suppose we could also have former mayor Rudy Giuliani on because , well , I don ' t know why . He won ' t say anything he hasn ' t said before , but it just feels like we should have him on , especially if Fox has him on . We could probably fill a bunch of time with the whole anthrax thing that came afterward , maybe do an entire terrorism retrospective that would look big and flashy but add no new information whatsoever , and just rerun that over and over and over again . Maybe throw in some of that mosque stuff . And then , oh , this would be perfect , we do profiles on the families who lost their loved ones on the Pennsylvania plane . We ' ll act as if we ' re shining a light on something that ' s been ignored , but really it hasn ' t been ignored , because over the past 10 years there have been 4 , 000 similar segments done about the circumstances surrounding that flight . "" But that ' s not what we ' re all about , " he added . " We ' re better than that . " 	 1

berwick, oh in spite of his efforts, video village clerk brad hersley was unable to prevent yet another rental of charlie's angels tuesday. " it happened again, " said hersley, shaking his head as he watched a customer leave the store with a copy of the 2000 blockbuster. " i can recommend better movies until i'm blue in the face, but inevitably, everyone gravitates toward charlie's angels. " hersley said he's been attempting to prevent rentals of the big screen version of the popular'70s tv show since its release in june 2001. " you can't imagine how many times i've gone through the same exact experience, " hersley said. " i'm running out of creative ways to say'charlie's angels sucks, so put it down and try again'in a way that the manager dave lennox won't get on my ass for. " " i'm helpless to stop them from bringing that into their homes, " hersley said. " what's more, i'm actually aiding them. do you know how that makes me feel? " after working at video village for almost two years, hersley said he is confident that, if asked, he could recommend a better movie than charlie's angels. " what am i even here for, if not to help the customers? " hersley said. " i'm not a film snob. if they want to see a mindless action movie, fine. i can suggest a ton of them : blade 2, starship troopers, the first die hard movie. if you want to see a movie with hot women kicking ass, why not get faster, pussycat! kill! kill!? why rent charlie's angels? why? " hersley has used various tactics in attempts to thwart those who would rent the movie, including misplacing the dvd box in the foreign film section, intentionally forgetting to re shelve returned copies, and subtly denigrating the customer's movie choice at the checkout counter. " i'm trying to help them, not hurt them, so i try to get on their side, " hersley said. " i'll use charlie's angels as a reference point for recommending other films, like out of sight. or i'll gain their trust by telling them that i liked xxx, and then launch into a list of recommendations. " more often than not, his suggestions are ignored, hersley said. " they know it's stupid, but everyone wants to see it anyway, " he said. " they want to believe it'll be good stupid, not bad stupid. what can i do? " even when he convinces a customer to rent something else, hersley said, the customer will often rent charlie's angels at a later date. " i can't be here every day of the week, " he said. " i'm only one man. inevitably, i'm gone, and my opinion is overshadowed by an idiot friend who insists that charlie's angels will be'fun.'" hersley said his criticisms of the movie are informed. in order to prepare employees to answer customers'questions, lennox encourages the staff to watch all of the latest blockbusters, even offering free rentals. " i saw charlie's angels, but you don't have to, " hersley said. " please, everyone, i'm begging you to listen. no matter what the box says, it's not a sexy, high octane update of the hit tv show. " the recent arrival of a six foot tall cardboard standee promoting the sequel, charlie's angels : full throttle, has further hindered hersley's rental prevention techniques. " how can i suggest another movie with that thing sitting there? " he said, hurling a pen at the promotional item. " now that charlie's angels : full throttle is coming out, there's been a big resurgence in rentals of the original. why? so they can remember where the story left off? " " now i'm hearing'is full throttle out yet?'50 times a day, " hersley said. " when it's finally released, at least i'll get the joy of telling customers it's out of stock. " hersley said he has no plans to see the sequel. " i try to watch everything, but i think full throttle is more than i can take, " hersley said. " when i was watching the first one, i had to pause it every five minutes to bang my head against the coffee table out of frustration. if i do end up watching full throttle, i'll have to remember not to pause it while i bang my head. that just makes the movie longer.

An inventive pensioner has come up with a novel way to avoid washing up by creating an edible spoon .Roy Webb , 77 , believes that his invention will be particularly useful at picnics and parties but that it does have its flaws .Mr Webb thought of the idea after eating canap s served on small , disposable spoons at a party .Roy Webb , 77 , has created a range of edible spoons that he believes are very useful at picnics and partiesHe set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites , such as p t , tomatoes , and strawberries .He made a spoon shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin .The grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown .He then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese , prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoons .He says that the four inch spoons can also be made from short crust pastry and covered in cream or yoghurt with fruit toppings , or dipped in chocolate and set in the fridge .Mr Webb , from Cheshire , said the snacks will reduce the amount of plastic cutlery that has to be thrown away after a picnic , as well as cutting out the washing up .Mr Webb thought of the idea after eating canap s served on small , disposable spoons at a partyHe set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites , such as p t , tomatoes , and strawberriesHe has now set up his own company selling edible spoon making kits for 25 each from www . ediblespoons . co . ukMr Webb , a retired design engineer from Cheshire , said : ' I have been to various parties and social gatherings where you are served with little assorted starters on ceramic spoons to go with cocktails and drinks .' The food was obviously eaten and the spoons where washed after use .' I thought why couldn ' t you make a spoon that can be eaten along with the canap , it would look just as attractive and would require no extra washing up .He made a spoon shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pinThe grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown' So I designed a cutter that would fit the shape of the spoon and started to experiment with various pastries .' The problem I found using dough was that to be strong enough to hold a filling it was far too thick , and if it was thinner it was too weak and would not work .' After many tests I found that by rolling out bread with a rolling pin the compression of the bread gave it great strength and when baked became the perfect material .' I have been getting orders for the kits from all over the world such as Australia , Spain , Canada , Italy , Greece , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and mostly from America .' The feedback has been very flattering . 'He then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese , prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoonsHe says that the four inch spoons can also be made from short crust pastry and covered in cream or yoghurt with fruit toppings , or dipped in chocolate and set in the fridge 	 0
Pregnant women have been warned that a type of antibiotic could harm their unborn baby .Researchers from Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London have linked erythromycin pills with epilepsy and cerebral palsy .The study tracked the health of babies born to 200 , 000 British women . Overall , the babies born to women who took antibiotics were no more likely to develop epilepsy or cerebral palsy .Woman have been warned the common antibiotic erythromycin could harm their unborn baby ( file photo )But women treated with erythromycin and other pills from the macrolide family of antibiotics were almost twice as likely to have a baby with one of these conditions as those given penicillin .The study , published in the journal PLOS ONE , found that a third of expectant mothers were given antibiotics during pregnancy , most commonly penicillin .Just 7 per cent of the women prescribed antibiotics were given macrolides , which are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin .However out of every 150 women given a macrolide rather than penicillin , there was one more baby born with cerebral palsy or epilepsy .Researcher Professor Ruth Gilbert advised pregnant women to keep taking any antibiotics that they are prescribed as an infection is likely to harm their baby .Erythromycin are from the macrolide family of antibiotics .Macrolides are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin .And she stressed that any increased risk to the unborn child posed by the pills would be extremely small .However , with four previous studies raising concerns about the pills , she said it was time for the pills to be thoroughly reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) .Professor Andrew Whitelaw , of Bristol University , warned that a bad infection could end up killing both the mother and her child .But he added : ' Nevertheless , drug treatment in pregnancy requires a very high level of safety and it will not surprise me if the regulatory authorities advise doctors to avoid or severely restrict macrolides in pregnancy ' .Others said that the study does not prove that macrolides are harmful , as it could be that the bugs they are used treat are more likely to damage the brain than other infections .Erythromycin is used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillinDr Christoph Lees , of Imperial College London , said : ' One thing is for sure : pregnant women should definitely take antibiotics when prescribed them as the risk of untreated infection to the pregnancy can be catastrophic .' To put things in context , the extra risk to their baby of being prescribed macrolides , if indeed there is a risk , is very tiny . 'The medicines ' watchdog , the MHRA , said it has already sought independent advice on the study and it does not consider that the research provides proper proof that macrolides are dangerous .A spokesman said : ' Importantly , this study found no overall evidence of harm when antibiotics are prescribed in pregnancy .' Any pregnant woman who has been prescribed antibiotics should continue to take them as instructed and speak to their healthcare professional if they have any questions . ' 	 0
HIGH BRIDGE , New Jersey " The thought that I can reach out and permanently improve someone ' s life for the better is addictive , " says Dave Schweidenback .Dave Schweidenback saw transformative effects of bikes while in the Peace Corps in Ecuador from 1977 80 .Several times a year , the 55 year old can be found prepping large shipments of used bicycles bound for a developing country . For Schweidenback , gathering and breaking down these bikes is a labor of love one that is helping to keep the bikes out of landfills and give them new life ." Used bicycles can transform the economic and social condition of families , " says Schweidenback . " They give people access to jobs , health care and education that is too distant for walking . "Since 1991 , Schweidenback ' s nonprofit Pedals for Progress has collected and shipped more than 115 , 000 used bicycles to 32 developing countries worldwide , where they are sold at a low cost to local residents like Don Roberto Garcia ." A used woman ' s mountain bicycle changed my life , " says Garcia , 54 , a house cleaning supplies salesman in Nicaragua who works six days a week to support his six children and buy medicine for his wife , who suffers from cancer .For 20 years , Garcia walked six to seven hours a day , hauling his merchandise in a wheelbarrow along a 6 mile route . This earned him 2 3 a day ." More than anything , I would always return home so tired from the walk , " Garcia recalls .Little by little , Garcia saved his money and was able to buy a used bicycle six years ago from a Pedals for Progress partner agency in Jinotepe , Nicaragua ." Because of a bicycle , I now earn about 4 a day , " says Garcia . " I sell more and I do my rounds quicker . I tell everyone to go buy a bicycle . " Watch Garcia explain how a used bicycle has helped him in NicaraguaThe seeds for Schweidenback ' s Pedals for Progress were planted years ago while he was volunteering for the Peace Corps from 1977 80 in Ecuador , near the Amazon Basin ." Besides the bus that comes through town and one guy that owned a pickup truck , everybody walked everywhere all the time , " he recalls ." My landlord was the exception because he owned the only bike in a 500 mile radius . He was the most successful man in the region because he could access a job and get wherever he needed to go . "Years later , Schweidenback noticed used bicycles at garage sales and in garbage cans throughout his New Jersey community ." I remembered how the need in developing countries was so great , that I couldn ' t stop thinking about it , " he says .Knowing the bikes could be put to better use , Schweidenback asked members of his community to donate 12 used bicycles he planned to send them to Ecuador . The community brought him 140 . Within a year , Schweidenback had created Pedals for Progress and shipped roughly 500 bicycles to developing countries .Today , Schweidenback organizes 140 used bike drives each year and , on average , collects 90 bicycles in three hours . Donors are asked to pay a 10 fee per bike to help cover shipping costs and reduce the cost of the bicycle when it ' s sold overseas . Each bike is sold for about 15 . Watch how Pedals for Progress bikes get from donors to people in developing countries" There ' s a bike that ' s unloved in every garage in this country . Rather than put these old bikes in landfills for no reason , we can use them as economic stimulus to aid our neighbors , " Schweidenback says ." This is the transfer of wealth between nations because these have great value overseas . And they give people the ability to hold a job or a child the ability to go to school . " Watch Schweidenback talk about his inspiration for Pedals for ProgressPedals for Progress bicycles have been sent to countries in Central America , Africa , Eastern Europe and the Caribbean . For Schweidenback , knowing he ' s making an impact keeps him going ." You can change someone ' s life with your bike . " 	 0
Authorities reject claim Isis brought down Russian passenger planeI did not know what would happen if I took that flight , Ms Gyunninen added . We could have been on that plane , we could have died .News of the disaster came through before she set off from Sharm el Sheikh and she called her mother to let her know she was safe .Ms Gyunninen s flight to the Russian capital was delayed for 10 hours , as news spread of the disaster .When we were flying back it was dead silent on board , she recalled . Everyone was alert , startled by any noise or jolt .Flight 9268 was just 23 minutes into its scheduled flight from Sharm el Sheikh to St Petersburg on Saturday morning when it disappeared from radar over the Sinai peninsula .Egyptian officials said the pilot radioed to report technical difficulties and planned an emergency landing at the nearest airport before losing contact with air traffic controllers . ?Analysts have speculated about a possible link to a tail strike accident the plane had in 2001 , which caused another air disaster ? that killed more than 500 people in 1985 , but Metrojet said the aircraft had been fully repaired and was in good condition .Russian passenger plane crashes in Egypt in picturesRussian passenger plane crashes in Egypt in picturesFlight 7K9268 crashed in the Sinai peninsula , in all probability killing every one of the 224 people on boardDebris lies strewn across the sand at the crash siteRelatives react after a Russian airliner with 217 passengers and seven crew aboard crashed , as people gather at the Kogalymavia s information desk at Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg on 31 OctoberA relative of a passenger of MetroJet Airbus A321 at Pulkovo II international airport in St Petersburg , Russia , 31 October 2015 .The plane ' s last recorded radar position above the northern Sinai peninsulaA satellite view from Google Maps of the rough area where the plane crashed , in the mountainous Hassana region of the Sinai peninsula .The Metrojet ' s Airbus A 321 with registration number EI ETJ that crashed in Egypt ' s Sinai peninsulaThe crashed Airbus A321 at Domodedovo international airport , outside Moscow , , on 20 OctoberA relative of a passenger on MetroJet Airbus A321 at Pulkovo II international airport in St PetersburgRelatives of passengers of MetroJet Airbus A321 at the Crown Plaza hotel in St PetersburgAn Egyptian soldier prays as emergency workers prepare to unload bodies of victims from a police helicopter to ambulances at Kabrit military airport on 31 October .Ambulances line up as emergency workers unload bodies at Kabrit military airport , 20 miles north of Suez , on SaturdayEgyptian paramedics load the corpses of victims into a military plane at Kabrit military air base by the Suez Canal on October 31 , 2015We rule out a technical fault of the plane or a pilot error , said Alexander Smirnov , deputy general director of the airline . The only possible explanation could be an external impact on the plane .Wilayat Sinai , an Egyptian jihadist group allied to Isis , claimed responsibility for the crash , saying it downed the jet in response to Russian airstrikes that killed hundreds of Muslims on Syrian land .Investigators said initial inspections showed no evidence of a missile strike or explosion and that it was too early to draw conclusions from the plane s break up , but the Kremlin has not ruled out terrorism in its investigation .Bodies of the 224 victims , including 25 children , were being flown home to Russia and Ukraine today as tributes piled up at the airport where they should have arrived home in St Petersburg .Officials said that the Airbus A321 s black boxes were recovered in good condition and will be used to provide key information about the final moments before the crash . 	 0
A man who posted a video online showing deplorable conditions in his son ' s barracks at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , said Tuesday that " good things are happening " regarding repairs .A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan .Frawley ' s son , Sgt . Jeff Frawley , is living in the barracks after returning from a 15 month deployment to Afghanistan .Edward Frawley ' s 10 minute video shows still photos from throughout the barracks , which include shots of mold and rust in several areas . The video is posted on the popular file sharing site YouTube and Frawley ' s business Web site .Paint , which Frawley says is lead based , is chipping off . Ceiling tiles are missing . A broken drain pipe allows sewer gas into the building , while another one has tissues stuffed into it in an apparent effort to stop the gas from coming in .Photos from the communal bathroom show some of the most disturbing images . In one , a soldier stands in a sink to avoid what Frawley says is 3 inches of sewage that covered the floor when toilets overflowed . Watch the run down conditions that soldiers have been living inAt times , " sewage water backs up into the sinks in the lower floors of these barracks , " Frawley says in his narration .Also , " The soldiers have to tell one another who ' s taking a shower when they turn the sinks on , or the person taking the shower gets scalded with hot water , " he saysEdward Frawley said Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen . Dick Cody called him on Monday to say that he shared his anger and that there was no excuse for soldiers living in such conditions ." He talked to me for 30 minutes , and I believe what he said , " Frawley told " American Morning . " " He said he wouldn ' t want his sons coming back and going into these kinds of living conditions , and he just said somebody dropped the ball and they ' re going to fix it . "Frawley said the Army had promised to have new barracks ready when his son ' s unit , part of the 82nd Airborne Division , returned from Afghanistan ." The conditions depicted in Mr Frawley ' s video are appalling and unacceptable , and we are addressing the concerns he expressed , " Maj . Tom Earnhardt , spokesman for the 82nd Airborne , said in a written statement ." Our paratroopers are our most valuable resource , and our commitment is to their well being . Our actions now must represent the best we can do for our soldiers . "He added , " Fundamentally , we acknowledge these conditions are not adequate by today ' s standards . The images in Mr Frawley ' s video are alarming , and our soldiers deserve the best conditions we can provide as an institution . "U . S . Sen . Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina is among government officials who have responded to the video . In a written statement , she called living conditions in the barracks " unacceptable " and said the situation " must be immediately corrected . "A group of congressional staffers toured Fort Bragg on Tuesday ." My son is in a tough situation because he wants to make the military his career , " he said . " Gen . Cody and the colonels . . . guaranteed me this wouldn ' t come back on him . He had nothing to do with it ." Cody agrees that the pictures are accurate . He doesn ' t want his men living in conditions like that . . . . Who wants their sons living in that ? " E mail to a friend 	 0
READING , Pennsylvania Kate Gosselin sat at her kitchen table talking to her best friend Kinsey San Joaquin . KatGo , the name Kate is now going by , said that she cannot believe that the man that she trusted more than even Dancing With The Stars host Tom Bergeron could betray her like he did .Bedroom Pillow Talk , the nationally syndicated news program is reporting that Gosselin ' s bodyguard and BFF Steve " The Gray Fox " Nield was allegedly caught at L . A . ' s LAX Airport in the possession of 37 nude pictures of Kate Gosselin .TSA pat down agent Anthony Alejandro Dockenbong reportedly found the photos stuffed in Mr Nield ' s boxer shorts . Dockenbong said that when he reached down to grab Nield ' s pecker to pat it down he noticed quite a bulge in his shorts that he knows not even noted porn star Ron Jeremy possesses .Upon further investigation Dockenbong found that Nield had indeed stuffed the photos , which were in a folded Manila folder in his underwear .When asked to explain , Nield said that he had no idea how in the world the Manila folder had gotten into his briefs but he realized now why his crotch had been itching so bad on the cab on the way to the airport .Agent Dockenbong confiscated the 47 photos and marked them TSA Pat Down Procedure Exhibits 1 through 47 .Nield was allowed to continue on with his flight to Reading , Pennsylvania , where Kate Gosselin resides .No charges were filed against Mr Nield but he was warned to be careful because KatGo has one hell of a temper and the blonde flaky bitch can make a grizzly bear seem like a child ' s teddy bear . 	 1
Over the past few days we ' ve heard a lot of criticism directed at the National Football League after the arrest of a Dallas Cowboy player on an intoxication manslaughter charge . And justifiably so : A 25 year old father to be who was riding in the player ' s car is dead .But we can ' t fall into the trap of making this conversation all about the NFL or even professional athletes . Doing that is a cop out .Legendary country singer Randy Travis was arrested this year on a driving while intoxicated charge .South Carolina state Rep . Ted Vick was arrested this year on a charge of drunken driving .Florida ' s Jacksonville Sheriff ' s Office said Joshua Postorino , a Georgia Tech assistant basketball coach , was " swerving all over the road " before being arrested last week on a driving under the influence charge .We can try to make this conversation about NFL players but of the nearly 2 , 000 men who suit up per season , 14 DUI arrests are made , according to USA Today . That equates to a . 7 percent rate . The rate for men in the general population ages 20 to 29 , the age bracket of most NFL players , is twice that . Meanwhile , men 21 to 34 are responsible for 42 of all DUI deaths .Read more : Dallas Cowboys players involved in fatal crash were ' like brothers 'This issue isn ' t about football players . The MetLife Stadium doesn ' t stop serving alcohol at the beginning of the third quarter because officials are afraid the players are going to try to drive home drunk .If we want to use this tragedy in Dallas to talk about DUIs , then perhaps we need to be more focused on the men who watch the games , not play them . The stats suggest the average guy probably doesn ' t need to go the full six degrees of separation before finding a connection with another guy who got behind the wheel of a car when he shouldn ' t have .When I look back at my 20s , I know I ' ve been lucky more than once , and I thank God that his grace covered me when my pride put me and others in harm ' s way .Too proud to say I ' ve had too much to drink because men are supposed to be able to handle our liquor .Too proud to say I need a ride home , because that would be asking for help and men don ' t like to do that .Too proud to admit I might ' ve been out of control , even though being out of control is the main side effect of excessive drinking .The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says men are much more likely than women to drink excessively and drive at high speeds . Men average about 12 . 5 binge drinking episodes a year Women average 2 . 7 .And yet we want to make this entire conversation about sports , when this is no more a sports story than a rerun of " Sex and the City . "Last year Alan Hale , a state representative and bar owner from Montana , got on the House floor and advocated for a repeal of all DUI laws because they hurt small businesses and " they ' re destroying a way of life . " FYI : There is no professional sports team in Montana .Our culture promotes a casual attitude about intoxication from " The Hangover " to Jamie Foxx ' s Grammy winning " Blame It " and then gets all pious when something bad happens because of alcohol .If we want to have a grownup conversation about DUIs , that ' s where it should start : Otherwise we ' re just sucking up oxygen .Does this mean the NFL should ignore drunken driving arrests of its players ? Of course not .But the CDC says adults got behind the wheel drunk an estimated 112 million times in 2010 nearly 300 , 000 times a day and that 81 of all drunken drivers are men . So whatever thoughts we may be harboring about athletes who drink and drive , it would be wise to extend those feelings far beyond the realm of sports .Nearly 11 , 000 people are killed each year because of alcohol impaired driving . But since 1998 , there have only been three NFL players who have been suspected of having killed someone because of driving drunk .You can do the rest of the math from there .The opinions in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson . 	 0
With the release of ancient photos depicting her Royal Majesty , Queen Liz , prancing around in Pantomime gear circa 1941 , younger members of the Royal menagerie have been pressing Liz for a repeat performance .Seemingly , having taken one look at the upcoming Christmas TV schedules and decided 90 of it is pure crap both Prince Haribo and Prince Wills have approached their dear old Gran and suggested a right Royal Pantomime this year , over and above the usual one . And have arranged for Channel 4 to record the entire show unedited , thus proving that the Royals are ordinary arseholes under the pomp and circumstance vaneer .Her Maj is said to be thrilled with the idea having never forgotten how ' excited ' she had become , way back in 1941 , when her Panto bloomers began to chafe her extremities and cause her to orgasm , not once but thrice ! Sadly a performance never repeated during her married life with the Greek !Having gathered various members of the Royal clan together over a KFC Family Bucket Liz invited suggestions as to just what Panto they should perform once she has mimed her way through the customary Christmas speech . After a few hours of belching , farting , hiccupping and wiping of greasy fingers on the drapes behind closed doors it has been decided that Snow White and The 7 Dwarfs will be dusted orf and duly presented in the main lounge of Buck House immediately after dinner and before Eastenders comes on .Liz has opted for the role of the evil stepmother due to her life long experience dealing with every Tom , Harry and the occasional Dick when she was younger and is also in charge of casting .First up the 7 dwarves themselves , in no particular order as Mr Schofield would say , they are as follows : Dopey Prince AndrewHappy Prince CharlesSneezy Peter Philips ( grandson )Bashful Edward earl of wessexGrumpy Princess AnneDoc Duchess Of YorkSleepy Phil the GreekOther characters are as follows : The Huntsman Prince WilliamMirror on the Wall Camilla Farting BowelsSnow White KateThe Prince Prince HariboVillage VirginS Eugenie BeatriceIn keeping with today ' s ' yooful ' image the two Princes ' have insisted on a more non PC risqu version of this time honoured fairy tale and have cajoled her Majesty into letting Jim ( she said she was 18 guv ' ! ) Davidson write the script . Thus , there will be an element of semi nudity in the Panto , especially when the Prince gets his leg over the sleeping Princess and attempts to give her one while she is sleeping in her see through negligee . Indeed , the Huntsman will be cavorting about in the ' woods ' with his large chopper in his hand , Grumpy with be depicted as a transsexual , Happy will be seen snorting and talking to the tree ' s and last but not least , Snow White .Far from being the angelic and innocent lass as depicted in countless adaptations of this timeless story today ' s modern Snow White will be depicted as an insatiable vixen intent on having her wicked way with anything in trousers , especially Prince Haribo ( in or out of character ) and taking part in a gangbang with the dwaves . A case of life imitating art as they say in showbiz circles !Strong language is to be expected throughout the entire performance and is not necessarily attributed to Mr Davidson ' s script as the Royal ' s at large are frequently heard to swear like troopers , especially Phil the Greek when he treads in the Corgi dog shit .The entire performance is expected to last somewhere in the region of two hours and will be attended by a star studded galaxy of dignitaries and celebrities including the Beckham ' s , Do nothing Dave and his squeeze , Samcam , Little Eddie Millipeed , Ed Ballup , the cast from TOWIE and , if back in time , the survivors from GMOOHIAC plus that intrepid Australasian explorer , Anton Dec . It is possible that Tom Daly will turn up in order to shout out those immortal lines , " watch out , he ' s up your behind ! " or words to that effect .It is expected that Nigella Lawson will be in attendance to assist with the refreshments and distribution of ' artificial snow ' in order to give the entire proceedings a truly out of this world experience for one and all . 	 1
You ' ve been thinking about it for weeks . Mounds of turkey piled high with buttery mashed potatoes , dripping with gravy .Green bean casserole and pumpkin pie . Or sweet potato casserole and pecan pie . Cranberries . Collard greens . Stuffing .Every year , we spend hours making the traditional Thanksgiving favorites just like our mom used to do , like her mom did before that ." When you do something repeatedly over the years , it builds up a kind of power , " nutritional psychologist Marc David says . " It creates its own momentum . To make the same dish year after year , decade after decade , there ' s something in that that connects us to the past . "Nostalgia comes from the Greek word for homecoming ( nostos ) and pain ( algos ) . But experts say feeling nostalgic is actually good for your mental health .Anything can bring on that special moment music , smells , photos . We play the same songs , cook the same recipes , take the same family photo in the same spot next to the same fireplace because we ' re human , David says . Our biological functions are based on repetitive rhythms . Our brains are hardwired to relax when surrounded by the familiar ." Emotional eating has gotten a bad name , " David says . " We ' re emotional people . We are emotional beings . We ' re built for pleasure . "Nostalgic products fill a need to belong and feel socially connected , according to an Arizona State University study published in the Journal of Consumer Research last year .That ' s why this time of year , TV and radio ads are filled with smiling families sitting around a large table in holiday sweaters , passing the dinner rolls . Even if you ' re far away from home , companies want you to believe that buying those same dinner rolls will fill your heart with holiday joy . Turns out , it works .Dr Clay Routledge works with other researchers from the University of Southampton ' s nostalgia project . He recently published an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology titled " The past makes present meaningful . "Nostalgia , Routledge found , increases a person ' s self esteem . Daily activities like going to class or attending meetings are routine , even boring . When we engage in nostalgia , we tend to think of the things that are really important to us . That makes us feel like our life is meaningful .Taste of Home ' s sweet potato tart recipe" What ' s amazing about autobiographical memory is that bad memories fade faster than positive memories , " Routledge says . " One thing that ' s interesting about nostalgia is that it ' s not 100 detail accurate it ' s more the highlights . "Nostalgia is largely social . Routledge ' s studies found that people who are alone or disconnected feel better after engaging in nostalgia . Yet you ' re probably dreaming right now about your grandfather ' s deep fried turkey , not about him , right ?" Is it really about the food ? " Routledge asks . " Or is the food just sort of a trigger or cue for what the holidays are really all about , which is relationships . We don ' t eat these foods other times of the year because we ' ve segmented them off as special . They go with this occasion . They go with the relationships . "For Taste of Home editor Catherine Cassidy , Thanksgiving means cooking for the ones she loves . She gets satisfaction in putting good food on the table for her family . So many of our best moments from the past , she says , are rooted in our sense of smell ." We call them food memories . When it comes to the holidays we are always trying to recreate the magic and the specialness we experienced when we were children . "So indulge in a little Thanksgiving daydream . Long for the oyster stuffing . Sniff the air in anticipation of mom ' s pumpkin pie . Then on the big day , enjoy your holiday feast , and all the benefits that come from the power of nostalgia . 	 0
DALLAS A western honeybee measuring barely one quarter of an inch in length and weighing approximately . 03 ounces triggered panic among a gathering of six fully grown Homo sapiens during a picnic at Davis Park on Monday , witnesses reported ." Where is it where is it ? " said 44 year old general manager Charles Freid , who has been described by his coworkers and business rivals as " ruthless , " after the bee happened to fly in his general direction . " Get it off me ! Is it on me ? "" Jesus ! " added Freid , screaming and flailing his arms as he raced to his car , got inside , and locked the doors .The college educated humans , all of whom are not allergic to bee sting venom and possess both cerebral and muscular capacities several orders of magnitude beyond that of the insect , proceeded to retreat in abject fright from its half millimeter stinger , which , when used , causes a twinge of discomfort followed by mild irritation and kills the bee .According to entomologists at the University of Texas at Dallas , the Apis mellifera was most likely trying to pollinate a nearby cluster of dandelions and was not , as alleged by 50 year old attorney Georgia Sakko , who has twice endured the pain of childbirth and successfully battled breast cancer , " out to get us . "" Don ' t make it angry don ' t make it angry ! " Sakko said . " Is it in my hair ? I feel something in my hair . Somebody get it out . Get it out ! "Airline pilot Mike Grunwold , 49 , who is approximately 1 , 224 times the size of the bee , said that he was " certain " the bee had landed on Sakko ' s back . Fiber tests on Sakko ' s clothing later found no traces of a bee ' s presence , but did reveal a small piece of lint and matted hair that may have resembled an insect at a distance and in certain lights .Civil engineer , marathon runner , and Gulf War veteran Scott Fogel , 39 , briefly attempted to use force against the bee ' s non aggressive actions , waving it away with a paper plate . After accidently upending a container of potato salad , which caused the bee to suddenly swerve , Fogel leaped back several feet and dashed for cover behind a trash can ." They ' re attracted to sweat , " Fogel said . " It makes them want to kill . Just try to keep as far away from it as you can . "After the bee seemingly disappeared , the humans members of a species that has crossed an Ice Age land bridge from Asia to North America , domesticated the wolf , built the pyramids , and landed a manned vehicle on the surface of the moon walked cautiously back to the picnic area ." I think it ' s gone , " personal trainer Marcus Weller , 32 , said . " Thank God . "A few seconds later , the bee emerged from an overturned Coke can , prompting the humans to scream and retreat once more . They opted not to return to the area , abandoning several hundred dollars ' worth of food and picnicking equipment . The brutalized parkgoers characterized the day as " totally ruined . "The bee , which was reportedly never more than vaguely aware of the presence of other living organisms besides the blooming plants it sought , eventually returned to its hive without incident . 	 1
NEW YORK Following Hurricane Sandy ' s destructive tear through the Northeast this week , the nation ' s 300 million citizens looked upon the trail of devastation and fully realized , for the first time , that this is just going to be something that happens from now on .Gradually comprehending that this sort of thing is now just a fact of life , citizens all across America stared blankly at images of destroyed homes , major cities paralyzed by flooding , and ravaged communities covered in debris , and finally acknowledged that this , apparently , is now a regular part of the human experience ." Oh , I see this is just going to be how it is from here on out , " said New York City resident Brian Marcello , coming to terms with the fact that an immense storm that cripples mass transit systems and knocks out power for millions in the nation ' s largest metropolitan area can no longer be regarded as an isolated , freak incident , and will henceforth be just a normal thing that happens . " Hugely destructive weather events are going to keep happening , and they are going to get worse and worse , and living through them is something that will be a part of all our lives from now on , whether we like it or not . "" I get it now , " Marcello added .Faced with the prospect of long months before any of the widespread damage is truly repaired , the millions who reside along the Eastern Seaboard told reporters today they fully understood , for the first time , that natural disasters killing scores of Americans and costing billions of dollars are going to be routine events , not just in the immediate foreseeable future , but permanently .Sources added that by early Wednesday morning , it abruptly occurred to millions more citizens that the news stories they ' ve been seeing that feature displaced families , photos of debris , shut down businesses , and government relief efforts have already started to feel " extremely familiar , " because these are things that happen now ." I was just watching a CNN news story about how much damage Sandy has caused in comparison to Katrina , Ike , or last year ' s storm that ravaged the Northeast , and it dawned on me : ' Ah , okay , being a human being on Planet Earth , pretty much no matter where you are , now involves the threat of one day having your home , city , or country decimated in a matter of hours by a severe weather event , ' " Detroit resident Stacy Hillman said . " Looking at images of cities actual American cities flooded with water is no longer an incredibly weird , unprecedented thing to see . It has happened before , it happened this week , and it will continue to happen again and again in the future , and to an even greater extent . "" So , then , I guess that what it means to be a member of human civilization has changed forever , pretty much , " Hillman added . " And that this is the new world we live in . "A Reuters poll conducted earlier this week found that 43 percent of Americans reported finally accepting the fact that a potentially endless number of increasingly lethal natural disasters would likely occur throughout the coming decades , while as many as 18 percent of respondents said they were " almost relieved " knowing that the possibility of their entire life being washed away in an instant now existed ." Right now , Americans all across the country are watching the aftermath of this storm and at long last recognizing that this is what life is like now , " said Dr Richard Morales , a climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania . " Admittedly , it could take a little while for some to fully acknowledge it , but at the end of the day , people will be much happier once they accept that they and their loved ones will likely suffer the consequences of an even stronger , more deadly hurricane at some point very soon . It ' s going to happen . "" I went through something very similar a few years ago when I finally came to terms with the fact that no one would ever listen to anything I said about global warming , " Morales added . " And that it is entirely too late to do anything about it . " 	 1
CLEVELAND Sarah Palin stopped off in Cleveland on her Nationwide Bus Tour . She told a gathering of 27 people in a parking lot at a local Mrs Al Capone Pizza Parlor that she has always loved Cleveland .She said that when she heard that the NFL Cleveland Cavaliers had acquired quarterback LeBron James she knew that they would definitely win the World Series .Sarah smiled and said that even though they did not win the Super Bowl there is always next year , so the team can just keep on practicing their dribbling , their tackling , and their ball stuffy stuff and win next year .Some of the crowd started booing and the " Loose Moose " quickly told them to stop it . She said that only Democrats boo her and she will not stand idly by and be booed by fellow Republicans .One woman , who was wearing an " I Want Mike Huckabee " T shirt yelled out for her to stick her Tea Party issues up her GOP wazoo .Palin was then asked what she thought about the main stream media giving her the nickname of " Crosshairs . "She made a finger gesture and said that she did not like it . She said that if this was the 1880s she would have taken her high powered telescopic hunting rifle and shot whoever made up that name right in his Democratic belly button .When " Snowflake " was told that high powered telescopic rifles did not exist in the 1880s she giggled , raised her eyebrows , rolled her eyes , scratched her crotch , and remarked , " Well maybe there weren ' t any in the Lower 48 , but ya know , by golly gee willikers , we sure had the little SOBs up in Alaska . "Palin did stress to the crowd and to the three reporters who were present that she would not be taking any questions on Paul Revere , Betsy Ross , or North Korea .The former ex future mother in law of Levi Johnston was then asked by a local newspaper reporter if she could name the five Great Lakes . " Snow Plow " paused for a few moments and them said , " You betcha I can . And let me say that , that ' s a fairly easy one . . . Lake Tahoe , Salt Lake , Lake Okeechobee , Veronica Lake , and Arthur Lake . "EDITOR ' S NOTE : Wow . Is it any wonder why Sarah Louise Palin is considered to be the Paris Hilton of Politics ? 	 1
Phoenix , Arizona Local residents spotted GOP Presidential candidate Newt Gingrich courting Ron Paul ' s wife , Carol , at an upscale restaurant in Phoenix this past Friday evening . Given Newt ' s past marital problems , this will likely not bode well for his already dwindling Presidential bid .Several locals spotted Gingrich and Paul ' s wife making out and groping each other ' s thighs at the bar at an Applebee ' s on 44th Street .When asked about what else happened after dinner , Gingrich replied , " I find it despicable that you guys in the left wing media will look for anything to help Barack Obama win the election . If Ron Paul wants to talk about free markets , I think he would agree that his wife is a free enterprise . "Congressman Paul had been campaigning for 72 straight hours at local community colleges since Wednesday of that week ." I don ' t think there is anything for me to be angry about . I am a candidate of peace and I don ' t believe in intervening in other people ' s personal lives , including the personal life of my lovely wife , " Paul explained . " Plus , I have been impotent for decades , so I kind of understand why she did it . "Newt Gingrich is arguably the hottest politician ever , with the possible exception of Senator Harry Reid ( D NV ) . He has a beautiful white snowcap piece of hair on his head , a tantalizing beer belly , and a high pitched voice caused by excessive marijuana usage . These traits have been known to cause women to flock to Newt Gingrich for wild sex .According to Carol Paul , Friday ' s ' fling ' was not the first sexual encounter she has had with Gingrich . " We used to bang all the time back when my husband and Newt served in Congress together , " said Carol . " It really turned me on that Newt was Speaker of the House and had so much power , while my pathetic husband was virtually unkown . " This affair had died out for twenty six years after Gingrich resigned as Speaker of the House . " When he won the South Carolina primary , I just had to have him again . I was so turned on , " said Carol Paul .Many of our reporters have attempted to question Newt ' s wife , Callista , but she is a bird , so she could not comment .Neither congressman Paul nor former Speaker Gingrich will be dropping out of the race any time soon ." If I let the leftist media have their way , Barack Hussein Obama will be President again , and I refuse to let that happen , " Gingrich said . " I will also not end the affair unless Ron agrees to challenge me in three Lincoln Douglas style debates with a time keeper and no moderator . "" No . I will not debate Newt . What ' s the point ? " Paul said in response to the challenge . " She ' s kind of beat anyway and it ' s not like I get aroused anymore anyway . I ' m more worried about changing America ' s foreign policy and monetary policy . "Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum was not asked to comment , but he did anyway ." I think this is representative of a serious crisis I intend to address if I am President . Family values are the most important thing that we need to address in America . Forget jobs . Forget the economy . It ' s all about faithful marriages and having as many babies as possible . Everyone except my Christian brothers and sisters and myself are going straight to hell . "Carol tagged Newt Gingrich in forty pictures on her Facebook , but Newt swiftly untagged himself before we could get to them . It will be interesting to see how Gingrich responds to difficult questions regarding this recent affair in this Wednesday ' s debate which will air live on CNN at 8pm Eastern time . 	 1
CHARLOTTE , NC Sources at Cobalt Media confirmed Tuesday that the wow factor an intangible set of viscerally pleasing features that instill onlookers with a feeling of exhilaration and intense interest was successfully added to this Thursday ' s upcoming PowerPoint presentation , entitled " New Ideas For Integrating Social Media Into Product Marketing . "According to those who will deliver the presentation to executives from Sketchers , the 1 : 34 a . m . addition of an animated bar graph depicting the market share percentages increasing as colored bars extend slowly upward provided the final wow factor inducing element ." When we first finished the PowerPoint , the content was all there , but it still lacked that certain something , " head market researcher Jeremy Batson said . " For example , we wanted to drive home the fact that , in the age of Twitter , we as a marketing company have an obligation to harness the power of distinct thoughts within a limited space . So we spiced that section up by including pictures of celebrities who use Twitter . The Ashton Kutcher photo we found is freakin ' hilarious . "" And then from there we go boom , " continued Batson , clapping his hands together , " straight into the section about how we can use Google Reader to track activity streams . I think it ' s really going to floor them . "Members of the group told reporters that , prior to the wow factor ' s insertion , the presentation was lacking in both sizzle and pop . These necessary dynamics , along with punch , were integrated by adding more than 30 " flip left " slide transitions , replacing basic blue backgrounds with a more colorful aurora borealis template , and inserting an audio element featuring the Smash Mouth song " Walkin ' On The Sun . "During an 11th hour meeting about how to push the wow factor even further , the 12 person presentation team also made the breakthrough decision to replace normal bullet points with miniature Cobalt company logos ." Overall , we wanted it to be more visual , more active , more in your face , " said assistant market coordinator Chris McConnell , who contributed most to the wow factor by suggesting that some graphics " fly in " from the right side of the screen . " Basically , we said , ' What can we do to absolutely knock the socks off company CEO Nathan DeGeorge ? ' And that ' s when Matt had the idea that instead of all of us standing behind a podium , we ' d begin the presentation by entering from the back of the conference room . "McConnell said that the wow factor ' s official implementation was the culmination of nearly a dozen conference calls with the Chicago office and three all night meetings to determine how to " successfully and meaningfully " wow those watching the presentation .During those early wow factor brainstorming sessions , presenters ultimately agreed that in order to really make the wow factor jump off the screen , the PowerPoint presentation would need to be bolstered by several complementary outside wows . According to office sources , that is why market analyst Marie Waters will begin the presentation by asking audience members to close their eyes and envision a world where teenagers flock to the unveiling of a new Sketchers billboard .If that fails to wow them , Waters said , she doesn ' t know what will ." This presentation really reaches out and grabs you , " Waters told reporters , adding that she is banking on a big promotion for her work on the wow factor . " Once the audience sees our font choice on slide 15 , they ' re not going to know what hit them . "Past Cobalt presentations indicate that the company has a history of wow factor packed speeches . In February , a presentation on pragmatic marketing included the results of an anonymous office wide survey , which many agreed really gave the presentation wow factor . And last month , the board of trustees was almost over wowed when market researcher James Clement was able to convince local weatherman Mark Mathis to tape a prerecorded message about the company ' s favorable economic forecast .Now that they ' ve added the final touches of wow factor to Thursday ' s presentation , employees seem confident their pitch is a can ' t miss ." To think about what our presentation was before it had that sort of , you know , that wow factor , is kind of embarrassing , " account supervisor Scott Weston said . " It was mostly just slides of straight statistics and comprehensive charts that explained very plainly that in order to more successfully get the word out about our clients , we should utilize all types of media . "Added Weston : " It would have been over in 30 seconds . " 	 1
ET SPECIAL : Love visual aspect of news ? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat !BEIJING : Beijing reacted harshly to a US warship sailing near one of its newly created islands in a disputed area of the South China Sea . The action did not spark a confrontation or roll back any Chinese island building activities , but it sent a high profile message to both Beijing and US allies that Washington wants to test Chinese sovereignty assertions and ensure freedom of navigation .As in previous incidents , Beijing is likely to voice its outrage for a time , before reasserting the wisdom of the government ' s calculated approach to its crucial relationship with the US However , the testy reaction underlines tensions in the strategically vital region through which about one third of global trade passes . Frictions are likely to worsen as Washington ' s renewed focus on Asia rubs up against Beijing ' s increasingly robust assertions of its claim to virtually the entire sea and its islands , reefs and atolls . China says its sovereignty claims do not conflict with the rights of other nations to operate in the South China Sea , although the Defense Ministry accused the US of abusing those rights .The maneuver itself was relatively tame . The US Navy sailed the guided missile destroyer USS Lassen past an artificial island created on Subi Reef in the Spratly archipelago . The route was within a 12 nautical mile ( 22 kilometer ) territorial limit that China might claim around the reef . However , international law permits " innocent passage ' ' of warships through other countries ' territorial seas without any need for prior notification , and there was no indication the ship did anything other than pass through . Still , the US said ahead of the trip that it was aimed at challenging any Chinese claims that the newly created islands are its sovereign territory .The sail by was intended to reinforce Washington ' s insistence on freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea , parts of which are claimed not only by China but by the Philippines , Vietnam , Taiwan , Malaysia and Brunei . While the US says it takes no view on ownership claims , it insists that the man made islands China has created do not constitute sovereign territory and cannot claim territorial seas .Until the legal status of South China Sea is settled once and for all , such incidents " will continue unabated , ' ' said US Naval Academy China expert Yu Maochun .China reacted angrily , saying the sail by was illegal , that it infringed on Chinese sovereignty and that it threatened the security of the island and the region . It said the maneuver would affect China US relations and summoned American Ambassador Max Baucus in Beijing for a high level protest . It is unclear on what basis China claims the sail by was illegal , partly because it has never clarified the basis of its claims to territory in the South China Sea . The Chinese response limited so far only to rhetoric suggests Beijing may tacitly acknowledges the freedom of navigation in the area , but does " not want the US to make a regular practice of it , ' ' said Phillip Saunders , director of the US National Defense University ' s Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs .Chinese Internet forums lit up with calls for a hard line against the US The official China Daily newspaper published an editorial Wednesday accusing Washington of " stirring the waters at the risk of regional peace and stability , ' ' and of using coercion to challenge what it called China ' s legitimate territorial claims . Public sentiment strongly favors China displaying its military superiority in the face of defiant acts by rival claimants , especially the Philippines and Vietnam , although Beijing has so far shied away from military escalation . Passions over the South China Sea pale in comparison to negative sentiment toward old rival Japan , with which China is competing over control of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea .China has said it will continue work on island building projects now underway , including the construction of buildings , harbors and airstrips on top of them . However , Washington ' s regional allies have been buoyed by the show of US resolve that follows warming military ties with the Philippines , former foe Vietnam and others . That may stiffen the determination of China ' s neighbors to stand up to Beijing ' s assertiveness . Other players in the region , including Singapore and Indonesia , are wary of being caught up in a sharpening dispute between Washington and Beijing and all sides are calling for negotiations on a long term solution to head off the possibility of conflict .Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App .

SEATTLE Foster mom Ellen Kovach told reporters Thursday she doesn ' t play least favorites , claiming that each of the minors placed in her home is provided with an equal amount of deep , seething animosity ." They ' re all my least favorite , " said the state certified caregiver of Jeffrey , 14 , Claire , 12 , and Trevor , 8 . " I really don ' t ignore or resent one more than the other . All three are a huge pain in my ass . "" Sure , sometimes it might seem like I spend more time arguing with Claire , but believe me , a good part of my day is devoted to reassuring Jeffrey and Trevor that they mean nothing to me , " Kovach added . " Those kids definitely know I hate them all the same . "Kovach , who receives monthly checks of 400 per child , was adamant in refusing to say which of the three juveniles she despised the most , insisting that Jeffrey , Claire , and Trevor were " all especially irritating in their own unique ways . "" They may think Trevor is my least favorite , because he ' s the whiny baby , but Claire can be a complete bitch , and Jeffrey is a lazy , disgusting slob who bugs the shit out of me , too , " Kovach said . " Deep down , they ' re all terrible . "The 43 year old foster mother , who confirmed she unconditionally loathes the three children , said she reminds them on a daily basis that they ' re the most unimportant part of her life . In addition , Kovach avoids giving preferential mistreatment to any of the youths by withholding affection from each of them equally .Kovach frequently offers words of discouragement to all her foster children , and the court appointed guardian is reportedly careful to heap scorn evenly , making sure to fairly distribute her criticisms and disparaging remarks ." I do try to be impartial by letting all three of them know they are pathetic losers who will never accomplish a goddamn thing , " said Kovach , noting she also takes time with the children to explain that each of them is a " leech " she doesn ' t want in her home . " They understand they are each individually very much unloved . "Though Kovach refuses to pick a least favorite foster child , her husband , Paul Kovach , said that he detests Jeffrey the most . The 44 year old part time electrician admitted he berates Jeffrey far more than the others ." Yeah , I single him out and tell him to ' shut his hole ' way more than the others , " the foster father said . " But it ' s just because he ' s a crybaby wuss who needs a little more belittling than the rest . "At press time , Paul Kovach reportedly went into Jeffrey ' s bedroom and threw out a pile of " pussy ass " books about cartooning . 	 1
A Kent State University professor of philosophy who is an admitted Luddite when it comes to tech and gadgets , told students that he thought the Pokemon craze was a great way to " winnow the herd " and that the more people who play the game while walking and driving the streets " the more we ' re going to rid the gene pool of the really stupid people . "Professor Terence Graybill ' s rant was recorded by a student and it went viral after she posted it to her blog . The professor was reacting to the 1 , 237 deaths and accidents the first weekend the game was released , deaths that police are already attributing to inattention by people playing the game .Professor Graybill had his own near miss with Pokemon players while he was driving home from dinner the first weekend the game was released . The professor was so annoyed with the careless drivers and pedestrians that he encountered , that on Monday he had his students compile any news stories that attributed deaths to people playing Pokemon Go .The shocking tally was 1 , 237 people killed and 4 suicides nation wide the first three days after the game was released . Most deaths were accidents but some of the more bizarre incidents were fodder for the Professor ' s Tuesday rant in his philosophy class .Player ShotOne Pokemon player was shot and killed on a Denver , Colorado homeowner ' s roof when he climbed on the roof to retrieve a virtual Pokemon placed in the man ' s house .Homeowner Ed Kazinske shot Steve Martinez also of Denver when Martinez apparently sat on the skylight . Martinez then fell through the skylight and was likely dead on impact according to the police report .Kazinske claims he thought Martinez was trying to break in and won ' t face charges for the shooting , but police found a trove of stolen items , including 39 car stereos in the man ' s house . Denver Police now expect to charge Kazinske with receiving stolen property .Car Hit By Train , Silo FireIn Amarillo , Texas , a 52 year old man and his two passengers were killed when they drove into the path of on oncoming train . Friends and witnesses said several cars were racing to a spot where they could catch an exotic Pokemon when Bear Fitzsimmons failed to stop for the oncoming train at a crossing .The crash ignited a propane car which quickly spread to a grain silo , two fire fighters were injured putting out the blaze .Tourist Dies Of ExposureNami Tomimoto of Osaka , Japan died of exposure in the Santa Fe National Forest when she tried to hike to an alpine lake where more Poke Stops and Pokemon are supposed to be stashed . Tomimoto was unfamiliar with the area and the night conditions above 10 , 000 feet and was simply unprepared according to Mountain Emergency Rescue volunteers who recovered the woman ' s body .3 Dead At Popular 5 . 11 Climbing Wall In UtahFamed climber Shandra Tyler retrieved a rare Medicine Pokemon in Utah that was accessible by a two hour experts only climb . The same day three inexperienced climbers had lost their lives attempting the same climb .BLM officials declined to name the location for fear of more Pokemon players being lured to their deaths , but noted that the area is temporarily blocked to car traffic leaving a 10 mile hike to deter any but the hardiest of athletes from even approaching the climb .Popular Professor Can ' t Be Fired AnywayMany in the community are calling for the Professor ' s firing after his bombastic remarks , but it seems unlikely to happen as Professor Graybill is wildly popular with students and the KSU Administration alike .A practicing capitalist , Graybill has made millions in real estate investments , but he espouses Buddhist , socialist and communist positions frequently in his lectures and rants that often go viral .That ' s not to say that there hasn ' t been backlash to his applauding the deaths of Pokemon players : Professor Graybill ' s house is now under 24 7 security as Pokemon players have made his house a gym for training Pokemon . Graybill has also been receiving death threats and harassing phone calls at his home . 	 1
Roger Federer ' s reputation as one of the finest tennis players of all time was cemented on Monday , as the Swiss broke Pete Sampras ' record for the most number of weeks at the top of the world rankings .Federer returned to the No . 1 spot for the first time in over two years with a record equaling seventh Wimbledon men ' s singles triumph , a victory which was also gave him an unparalleled 17th grand slam title .The 30 year old has now spent 287 weeks at the summit since turning pro in 1998 , one more than 14 time grand slam winner Sampras managed between 1993 and 2000 .By comparison , Steffi Graf holds the women ' s record total of 377 weeks at No . 1 , with Martina Navratilova second on 332 ." It is really an amazing feeling for me to have regained the No . 1 ranking , " Federer said on the ATP Tour website ." I had set a goal with my team to try to get back to the top of the rankings , but I never thought with the depth in the game this year that I would have been able to get it back so quickly ." I am extremely proud and honored to have beaten Pete ' s record as he was my childhood hero and I have always looked up to him . "Sampras , who retired in 2002 , congratulated Federer on his achievement ." Great effort . The hardest thing to do in sports is the ability to stay on top . Roger has been able to do so by great play and durability , " the American said .Behind Federer and Sampras on the list are eight time grand slam winners Ivan Lendl ( 270 weeks ) and Jimmy Connors ( 268 weeks ) while John McEnroe , a winner of seven major titles , was at the top for 170 weeks .Federer is " the greatest ever tennis player "Despite dropping out of the top three in October 2011 , Federer has still maintained his incredible run of reaching 33 grand slam semifinals in a row stretching back to the 2004 French Open .Federer spent a record 237 consecutive weeks at No . 1 between February 2004 and August 2008 , whereas Sampras only managed 102 weeks in a row .One record Federer is yet to claim is that of the oldest man to win a major . Andre Agassi achieved that feat by winning the 2003 Australian Open at the age of 33 years and 131 days .In the women ' s game , Wimbledon champion Serena Williams equaled older sister Venus ' total of 43 WTA Tour titles by beating fellow American Coco Vandeweghe in Sunday ' s final of the Bank of The West Classic in California .The dominant Williams sisters now share the record for the most tournaments won by players still active .The 30 year old Serena has won 28 of her last 29 matches and is now joint sixth on the all time list of WTA Tour title winners .The legendary Czech Martina Navratilova tops the list with 167 titles , ahead of American Chris Evert with 154 .Germany ' s Graf , the wife of Agassi , has 107 , while Lindsay Davenport of the U . S . collected 55 titles during her career .The Williams sisters are level with Switzerland ' s Martina Hingis and Justine Henin of Belgium .For former world No . 1 Serena , her recent run of form comes off the back of a 2011 season which was blighted by life threatening blood clots on her lung ." I ' ve never felt this fit , this strong , this happy to play and I think I can be even better , " fourth ranked Williams told the WTA Tour ' s website after her 7 5 6 3 win over the 20 year old Vandeweghe , who made it into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying ." I want to sustain this momentum and build on what I did at Wimbledon . I ' m going to get back on the grass now for the Olympics I ' m not sure when I ' m heading back to London , but I ' ll do it as soon as I can . "Williams will be looking to win her third gold medal in the British capital , after clinching the doubles title alongside Venus at the 2000 and 2008 Games . 	 0
Sitting in the first lady ' s box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform , Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported .While the President dedicated only a brief part of his State of the Union address to immigration , his message went beyond his speech , and the evidence was sitting among the guests invited to join the first lady in the viewing box .The 23 year old and his siblings are just one of the many thousands of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) . Avila was illegally brought into the United States with his younger brother and sister when he was 9 years oldDACA is a government program enacted in 2012 that stopped deporting some undocumented young people and instead granted them temporary work authorization and a two year reprieve from deportation .Obama hits the road to push State of the Union messageThe recipients have become one of the most visible groups advocating for immigration reform .Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22 day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November . And , for the last two years , Avila ' s been working as a voter engagement coordinator for Mi Familia Vota , a non profit Latino civic engagement program ." At the time , immigration reform seemed like it was dead . We won the hearts of the American people . We revived the conversation , " Avila said .Obama pleaded for cooperation and pointed out how getting immigration reform done this year was important for the country ' s recovering economy ." If we are serious about economic growth , it is time to heed the call of business leaders , labor leaders , faith leaders , and law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system , " Obama said .Without attacking House Republicans , the President described how both parties in the Senate passed a comprehensive bill last summer and said both parties in the House want to do the same . He said immigration reform would not only help the economy but shrink the deficit by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades ." When people come here to fulfill their dreams to study , invent , contribute to our culture they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody . So let ' s get immigration reform done this year , " he said .Obama spoke of immigration reform in broad strokes but that might have something to do with the plans of House Republican leaders to outline their principles for immigration reform at a party meeting this week .Opinion : Can Obama deliver action on inequality ?" We ' re going to outline our standards , principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with members , " House Speaker John Boehner said during a news conference after a party meeting .Obama steered clear of specific immigration reform policies . There was no mention of stopping the deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records , despite countless pleas from activists all over the country .Avila and his siblings no longer live in fear of being deported but his parents face that threat every time they leave their homes for work ." I grew up with the fear of being deported . My mom would always tell me to put my head down , " Avila said ." I still have the constant fear of my parents being deported . They are fearful and targeted even though they earn their living in an honest way , " said Avila , " One of the reasons that I keep strong is for them . "Still , Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014 ." We are closer than ever before . It shouldn ' t take any longer , " Avila said . 	 0
Tainted pacer Amir ' s return will strengthen Pakistan : AkramLegendary fast bowler Wasim Akram backed the return of tainted left arm pacer Mohammad Amir to the Pakistan cricket team , saying his inclusion will strength the squad .Amir made a return to competitive cricket earlier this year after serving out a ban for his role in spot fixing during Pakistan ' s tour to England in 2010 ." Amir has paid for his crime and must now be allowed back to the team . Amir ' s return will strengthen Pakistan as he is currently the best bowler , " Akram was quoted as saying by The Dawn on Wednesday .The former Pakistan captain was of the opinion that Amir needed to feature in more first class games to get back in the groove but put his weight behind the 23 year old ' s selection in the World Twenty20 squad .Akram echoed the words of Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Shaharyar Khan who earlier this week hinted that Amir may be considered for the series against New Zealand in January next year ." Yes , we are looking at a him for this series and he could return to the national side on the tour , " he said .Former captain Ramiz Raja , known to be critical of PCB ' s sympathy towards tainted fast bowler , said if he had powers to make a call on the matter , he would have never let the young fast bowler play again ." Pakistan cricket has suffered a lot . I don ' t have courage to face any more shocks or jolts again . I have experienced this practically and those who have witnessed such things practically can ' t forgive the characters involved in the act , " Raja said .However , Pakistan coach Waqar Younis , who had a detailed discussion on Amir ' s future with Shaharyar Khan last week , backed Amir and said " we are all on the same page " about the young fast bowler ' s future in international cricket ." Amir has served his punishment and he deserves to come back in the cricketing community and enhance his profession , " Waqar said after his meeting with Khan .Since his return , Amir has taken 22 wickets in a Grade II tournament before capturing an impressive 34 in the four qualifying matches of the Quaid e Azam trophy .He then grabbed 17 wickets in Pakistan ' s premier first class tournament , the Quaid e Azam trophy .In the Bangladesh Premier League , featuring for the Chittagong Vikings , Amir has picked up 14 wickets from 9 matches . 	 0

EAGLE POINT , OR Though local man Bret Kurtsin has had to overcome many personal obstacles since having his legs amputated seven years ago , it has been said that his greatest achievement may lie in what he has given to others : the inspiration not to lose any limbs of their own .Many of those who have met him and heard his story credit Kurtsin , who became a double amputee after he was hit by a drunk driver at the age of 20 , with motivating them to always retain the full use of both their arms and their legs ." Bret ' s story is really uplifting , " said Rebecca King , 17 , who heard Kurtsin speak during an assembly at her high school Wednesday . " After learning how much he struggles every day of his life to do things the rest of us take for granted , I ' ve realized how much I want , in my own life , to go through each day with my legs attached to my body . "" And my arms , too , for that matter , " she continued . " He really helped me put all of that into perspective . I now know the loss of a limb is something I never , ever want to go through . "Several community members told reporters that the grueling hours of rehabilitation and physical therapy Kurtsin has endured shows a determination and resilience they hope never to have to summon from within themselves , saying the 27 year old ' s necessary resolve has further encouraged them to keep each of their four limbs intact .Others noted that Kurtsin has taught them a lot more than the simple value of never having both legs amputated a few inches above the knee . They said watching him has also inspired them not to have any part of a leg amputated , not to suffer an injury causing leg or arm paralysis , and not to be born with a congenital limb deformity that would in any way make it harder to move around and grab things ." Bret has taught me that I enjoy walking quite a bit and that I would like to continue doing so in the future , " said family friend Leo Harris , 43 , remarking upon how hard it would be to perform simple tasks such as getting into a car or putting on pants without the use of both legs . " I look at him and appreciate how much I don ' t ever want to be an amputee or a paraplegic or bedridden or anything like that . It ' s a lesson I really owe to Bret . "" If even one of my limbs were amputated , I ' d probably just give up completely , " he added .According to teachers at Central Meridian High School , where Kurtsin spoke Wednesday , it wasn ' t merely the double amputee ' s story that resonated with the 200 students in attendance , but also his walk across the stage , for which he reportedly required the help of sophisticated prostheses ." The effect he had on the kids was amazing , " said ninth grade social studies teacher Therese Murray , adding that Kurtsin ' s difficult daily existence made her thankful her own legs have never been cut off . " They look at this man who has no legs , then they look at themselves , and something clicks : They ' re so glad they ' re not him . "Kurtsin , meanwhile , said he is just glad he can make a difference in the lives of young people ." There ' s nothing more rewarding than making that connection with kids , " he said .

ephemeral messaging apps such as snapchat, wickr and frankly, all of which advertise that your photo, message or update will only be accessible for a short period, are on the rise. snapchat and frankly, for example, claim they permanently delete messages, photos and videos after 10 seconds. after that, there's no record. this notion is especially popular with young people, and these apps are an antidote to sites such as facebook where everything you post lasts forever unless you take it down and taking it down is no guarantee that it isn't still available. these ephemeral apps are the first concerted push against the permanence of internet conversation. we started losing ephemeral conversation when computers began to mediate our communications. computers naturally produce conversation records, and that data was often saved and archived. the powerful and famous from oliver north back in 1987 to anthony weiner in 2011 have been brought down by e mails, texts, tweets and posts they thought private. lots of us have been embroiled in more personal embarrassments resulting from things we've said either being saved for too long or shared too widely. people have reacted to this permanent nature of internet communications in ad hoc ways. we've deleted our stuff where possible and asked others not to forward our writings without permission. " wall scrubbing " is the term used to describe the deletion of facebook posts. sociologist danah boyd has written about teens who systematically delete every post they make on facebook soon after they make it. apps such as wickr just automate the process. and it turns out there's a huge market in that. social media users migrating to smaller circlesephemeral conversation is easy to promise but hard to get right. in 2013, researchers discovered that snapchat doesn't delete images as advertised it merely changes their names so they're not easy to see. whether this is a problem for users depends on how technically savvy their adversaries are, but it illustrates the difficulty of making instant deletion actually work. the problem is that these new " ephemeral " conversations aren't really ephemeral the way a face to face unrecorded conversation would be. they're not ephemeral like a conversation during a walk in a deserted woods used to be before the invention of cell phones and gps receivers. at best, the data is recorded, used, saved and then deliberately deleted. at worst, the ephemeral nature is faked. while the apps make the posts, texts or messages unavailable to users quickly, they probably don't erase them off their systems immediately. they certainly don't erase them from their backup tapes, if they end up there. the companies offering these apps might very well analyze their content and make that information available to advertisers. we don't know how much metadata is saved. in snapchat, users can see the metadata even though they can't see the content and what it's used for. and if the government demanded copies of those conversations either through a secret nsa demand or a more normal legal process involving an employer or school the companies would have no choice but to hand them over. even worse, if the fbi or nsa demanded that american companies secretly store those conversations and not tell their users, breaking their promise of deletion, the companies would have no choice but to comply. that last bit isn't just paranoia. we know the u. s. government has done this to companies large and small. lavabit was a small secure e mail service, with an encryption system designed so that even the company had no access to users'e mail. last year, the nsa presented it with a secret court order demanding that it turn over its master key, thereby compromising the security of every user. lavabit shut down its service rather than comply, but that option isn't feasible for larger companies. in 2011, microsoft made some still unknown changes to skype to make nsa eavesdropping easier, but the security promises they advertised didn't change. this is one of the reasons president barack obama's announcement that he will end one particular nsa collection program under one particular legal authority barely begins to solve the problem : the surveillance state is so robust that anything other than a major overhaul won't make a difference. of course, the typical snapchat user doesn't care whether the u. s. government is monitoring his conversations. he's more concerned about his high school friends and his parents. but if these platforms are insecure, it's not just the nsa that one should worry about. dissidents in the ukraine and elsewhere need security, and if they rely on ephemeral apps, they need to know that their own governments aren't saving copies of their chats. and even u. s. high 	 0
SMYRNA , GA Gregg Reinisch , a Smyrna area masturbator , stays on top of all the latest trends in swimwear by watching the E ! cable network , it was reported Tuesday ." When I want the inside scoop on which swimsuit styles are heating up the beaches this summer , there ' s only one network I turn to , " Reinisch said of E ! , whose award winning swimwear coverage includes such programs as Fashion File : Sexy Swimsuits , Special Report : Beachwear ' 98 and An E ! History Of The Bikini . " E ! is the only channel that offers the kind of in depth information I crave . "According to the 26 year old masturbator , without E ! he would not know what suits to look out for on the beaches of St . Tropez and Rio de Janeiro , where less is definitely more ." About five or six years ago , before I started watching E ! , I took a trip to the south of France , " Reinisch said . " It was awful there were swimsuits all around me , but I didn ' t have the slightest idea which ones were the hot new styles to keep an eye on . I was an uninformed beachgoer , and that ' s the worst kind . "Barry Booker , E ! vice president of programming , said his network strives to be the leader in the field of swimwear coverage ." Why is our coverage the best ? Because we don ' t just tell the viewer what changes they can expect in swimsuit styles , we show them , " Booker said . " For example , if pink is the hot color for bikinis this year , we make sure to actually show what a pink bikini looks like on a tight bodied 20 year old down on all fours in the surf . Or if , for example , floral prints are in , we make sure to show what a floral printed bikini looks like on a tight bodied 20 year old down on all fours in the surf . Our viewers appreciate that . "" There is an amazing variety of swimsuits we can lovingly pan over while a model arches her back on a rock , " Booker said . " From the French cut one piece to the Brazilian style bikini , to the traditional G string , there are nearly as many swimsuits as there are masturbators . "While swimsuit fashion captivates Reinisch , it is by no means his only area of interest ." Lately , I ' ve been reading a lot of books about Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad calendars and how they ' re put together how the photos are taken , what ' s going through a particular cheerleader ' s mind as the photos are being taken . It ' s really a fascinating process , " Reinisch said . " So you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that E ! will soon air a half hour documentary on this very subject . Apparently , when the Dolphins cheerleaders went to Jamaica to shoot their 1999 swimsuit calendar , an E ! reporter and camera crew tagged along to get the inside scoop on the whole thing . It sounds incredible . I ' m masturbating just thinking about it . " 	 1
DETROIT Hip hop artist 50 Cent , formerly 90 Cent before the recession hit , has lashed out yet again at fellow rapper Kanye West .The " Half Dollar Dude " as Whoopi Goldberg calls him , recently talked with Afro Sheen Magazine ' s Yodelle Denzel St . Bling after he had performed at The Carburetor Coliseum in Motown .The man who was born Curtis Jackson , no relation to Michael , Kate , Phil , Alan , or Stonewall , is no stranger to feuds .He has had some highly documented verbal jousts with the likes of Oprah " Yo Yo " Winfrey , Sean " Fred Flintstone " Hannity , and Joan " The Moan " Rivers .50 Cent is perhaps best remembered for saying that if he had a choice of going to bed with Joan Rivers or an alligator he would pick the gator because the gator ' s teeth are not as sharp as Joan ' s dentures .He has now turned his sights on Kanye West , or as Taylor Swift refers to him , Kanye " The Pest . "After the Detroit concert 50 Cent told ASM ' s St . Bling that he cannot believe that Kim Kardashian even bothered to give West a second look much less invite him into her most intimate abode .He giggled and said that of course Kim is no prize herself . St . Bling asked why he felt that way ." Well brutha , juss takes a look at da woman . I swear da broad got herself two butts . She makes J . Lo ' s caboose look like it ' s damn well not even there . "He then went on to say " Hell I ' spect dat da two highly spirited lovebirds be fixin ' to esplode like dat Washington volcano Mount St . Helen Keller "EDITOR ' S NOTE : I ' m sure ' 50 ' meant to say Mount St . Helens .When Kanye was told about 50 Cent ' s remarks you could hear his teeth grinding like a Black and Decker electric saw . He yelled out , " Ya know what dude ? Dat low life , bottom feeding jive ass punk ain ' t got the brains of Popsicle stick . "He went on to add that 50 Cent looks like Kunta Kinte without the iron shackles . He paused for a moment and added that " Half Dollar Boy " has about as much personality as a dust bunny .SIDENOTE : St . Bling contacted Kim Kardashian to get her comment on the matter but all she would say was that she could not talk because she had just gotten some botox and her butt was hurting like a son of a you know what . 	 1
It is enough that , to me , it seems as if some around town are looking at this game as a layup . There is a good chance I m completely wrong about that , and a group of people as large as Chiefs fans cannot be generalized as all feeling one way or the other about anything .Exceptions include Jamaal Charles , Scott Pioli , That Kicker , and the silly CHIEEEEFS thing at the end of the national anthem .I am not here to tell you the Chiefs are going to lose . I actually think they will win , and that in a game of two terrific defenses , the difference will be the Chiefs have the better quarterback , which is quite a change .The Chiefs are a three point favorite on the road , which means I agree with smarter people about which is the better team . But the NFL is nuts , and Chiefs fans don t need to hear that favorites don t always win , or that a three point favorite generally and theoretically equates to about a 40 percent chance of losing .After the Raiders game , I wrote about how the Chiefs are the steady team in a field full of roller coasters , and that can be an advantage . If nothing else , this has the feel of perhaps the Chiefs best chance of advancing in the playoffs since , what , 1997 ?There is no prohibitive favorite in the AFC , and even in a competition that is usually won by the team with the highest ceiling , having the highest floor is at least something .With that in mind , I give you the completely unscientific , mostly nonsensical , why did you click on this breakdown of the Chiefs postseason possibilities :This week s eating recommendation is the Shoyu at Columbus Park Ramen Shop , and the reading recommendation is non sports but more than outstanding : John Spong on The Greatest Lawyer Who Ever Lived .As always , thanks for your help , and thanks for reading .mellinger Should the Chiefs consider attributing all of their momentum or just a portion of it to the Royals World Series Championship ?Sports make us all crazy , which is one of the best things about sports . It makes us obsess our free time on kids games played by millionaires and run by billionaires . It makes grown men paint their faces .Also , it makes people wonder if a baseball team winning the World Series can inspire a football team to make the playoffs .There are a thousand ways that fans and athletes look at and are affected by sports differently , and this may be the starkest . For a fan who cheers both sides of the Truman Sports Complex parking lot , the connection is obvious and unavoidable and perfectly harmonious .Two franchises that haven t had a lot to cheer about over the years simultaneously and finally finding their way , and doing so with similarly relentless paths that broke down longer odds than are typical even for teams that achieve big things .The relationships between the Royals and Chiefs are real , and genuine . There are friendships , some going back to college ( Luke Hochevar and Dustin Colquitt ) , and some starting here ( Eric Hosmer and Eric Berry ) . Mike Moustakas made an appearance at last weekend s Chiefs game . Many of his teammates have shown up in Chiefs gear . Generally speaking , there is a mutual respect and support between the franchises that didn t exist five or 10 years ago .But the idea that the Royals coming back in that eighth inning in Houston , or Lorenzo Cain scoring from first on a single , or Christian Colon finding his inner Dane Iorg . . . the idea that any of that is the reason the Chiefs have redirected their season from the garbage can to a wide open AFC playoff bracket is , if we re being honest , manufactured nonsense .The Chiefs saved their season because they got the right combination on the offensive line , figured out how to pick up stunts , and have a rare combination of strong leadership and steady coaching that did not let a 1 5 start turn into a splintered locker room of guys making individual business decisions .They saved their season because they have good players , because Derrick Johnson got quicker and surer as the season progressed , because Eric Berry made a remarkable comeback after chemotherapy treatments , because Marcus Peters is turning into a star , because Alex Smith is having the best year of his career , because Jeremy Maclin has brought production and swagger , and for a dozen other reasons including a softened schedule .The connection between the two franchises for fans is real , and it is spectacular . For a generation of sports fans in Kansas City , it is the glorious payoff for so much heartbreak and jokes about bad All Stars and kickers who shall not be named . It is , almost without question , the best time to be a sports fan in the history of this city .That s enough . We don t need to make stuff up about how Ned Yost inspired Dontari Poe . 	 0
Hong Kong Jeremy Lin , the undrafted Cinderella of the last NBA season , got peppered with questions by adoring fans and children in Hong Kong .What ' s it like seeing your name on a jersey ? In short : " Weird . "Did your parents want you to be a lawyer or doctor ? No .Can you speak Mandarin ? Some .What ' s your favorite Lin pun ? " Super Lintendo . "When the new Houston Rockets point guard returns to the basketball court in October , he not only faces the pressure of turning around a struggling franchise , but the expectations of the Asian diaspora who have elevated him to near folk hero status .His improbable run in February from a no name , Ivy graduate benchwarmer to a starting point guard rejuvenated the Knicks , dominated sports magazines and endeared him to fans in Asia .The Asian American NBA star arrived in Hong Kong this week , after stops in Taiwan and China ." The reception has been far beyond what I imaged , " Lin said , about his Asia trip . " I ' m grateful they support me and care . "Fans flocked into a Hong Kong mall with books , posters and his old New York Knicks Jersey . Some even dressed in Harvard Unversity shirts . Lin , who turned 24 on Thursday , looked at times sheepish by the outpouring of attention showered on him .On Thursday , he tweeted :Lin appeared in a kick off ceremony for an initiative , called New World Springboard that is designed to provide underprivileged kids with opportunities to sports and mentorship .The kids asked him questions like how he juggled his studies and basketball when he was a student . They cheered when he spoke haltingly in Mandarin .When asked about how he overcame challenges , Lin repeatedly spoke of his faith ." I think God has blessed me with unbelievable opportunity , the way he put everything together , the situation , I think it was a perfect storm . God is the first person I ' m going to attribute things to , " he said .When asked the question about nationality whether he considered himself Chinese , Taiwanese or American , Lin replied : " My identity is in Christ . "He also fielded questions about being Asian in the NBA and getting through stereotypes ." I ' m naturally stubborn and hard headed , " he told the audience . " Don ' t let people tell you what you can ' t and can do . People try to say you can ' t do this , you can ' t do that . Continue to chase what you love doing , work hard at it . "Lin signed a three year 25 . 1 million contract with the Houston Rockets in July after the New York Knicks decided not to match the offer . He will now play for the former team of Chinese center , Yao Ming .How does he handle the inevitable comparisons ?Lin described Yao , who is retired , as a " Hall of Famer , All Star and global ambassador for the game . "" What I ' ve done can ' t be compared to what he ' s done , " Lin said . " We both want to play the right way , inspire kids and grow the game . "" Linsanity " fans staked out hours before the event . Ryan Cheng , 20 , said he came out because " there are not a lot of Asian persons in the NBA . "" He ' s a true underdog story , " the college student added .His pal , Vincent Choi , standing beside him chimed in : " He ' s like a made for TV movie . " 	 0
POTOMAC , MD Noting a perceptible shift in the young relatives ' general attitude and demeanor , Weinberg family sources confirmed Thursday that cousins Jason Weinberg , 13 , and Jake Weinberg , 15 , seemed a lot meaner this year .Reports indicate the cousins ' noticeably changed personalities included sharper , more sarcastic senses of humor , an unambiguous lack of enthusiasm for spending time with cousins Katie and Ben whom they always seemed to get along great with before , sources emphasized and a marked indifference to the Weinberg family Christmas traditions in general ." They got meaner . And bigger , too . Bigger and meaner , " Katie Weinberg , 11 , said of her cousins , explaining that not only were Jason and Jake uncharacteristically rude , uninterested , and prone to wisecracks this year , but their physical appearances were also notably different , with Jason adding several inches in height and Jake adding substantial bulk to his previously slight frame . " They ' ve said about five words to me the whole time they ' ve been at our house . They just make little jokey comments to each other instead . "" And their voices are all deep , " Katie added .Sources close to the situation say the cousins ' behavior fluctuated between complete silence and snickering amongst each other , with Jake occasionally checking his smartphone and Jason almost imperceptibly rolling his eyes after every sentence uttered by an adult .Jason and Jake also reportedly showed significantly diminished interest in typically popular Weinberg Christmas traditions including playing with the dogs in the backyard , checking out what new items the respective Weinberg children had added to their bedrooms and wardrobes , and alternately jumping , rolling , and lying on Carol Weinberg ' s waterbed ." They won ' t even make eye contact , really , and the only words I ' ve heard them say are ' What ' s up , ' ' No , ' and ' I dunno , ' " Katie ' s brother Ben told reporters . " Jake has been wearing his sweatshirt hood on his head , indoors , for almost the entire time he ' s been here . "On the bright side , Katie noted , cousin Jake was looking a lot hotter . 	 1
in the showdown between the panthers and the broncos, it s whether cam newton and carolina can handle denver s virtually unstoppable pass rush that will determine the gamethe broncos won their eighth afc championship game by pressuring the hell out of tom brady. to win their third lombardi trophy, their defensive front will have to bring that same heat once again in santa clara. the panthers, however, present an entirely different challenge to von miller, demarcus ware, malik jackson and derek wolfe. these men won t see the same protections they saw on sunday. the patriots, being a quick striking spread offense, employ mostly five man protections, which enable them to send all five eligible receivers on routes. the panthers, as a run oriented team, take almost the opposite approach. much of their passing game occurs out of heavier sets with multiple tight ends and backs aligned tight to the formation. from this, they feature seven man protections ( i. e. max protection ), using no. 2 tight end ed dickson and either fullback mike tolbert or whoever is in at tailback ( jonathan stewart on base downs, occasionally fozzy whittaker on passing downs ) to block for cam newton.? thomas davis : i m not missing the super bowl. you better believe thatwith seven men in front of him instead of five, newton has more time in the pocket, which is why carolina s aerial attack is one of the league s most vertical. the panthers are very consistent in how they tactically employ their max protection, too. if newton diagnoses a blitz, the protection almost always involves what s called a full line slide, with all five linemen sliding in one direction, and the two extra blockers? often dickson and the running back? sealing off the backside in the other direction. the panthers, like most teams, typically reserve max protections for blitz looks. having the nfl s fiercest four man front, the broncos don t blitz often. but with carolina s o line being average athletically, max protections might still be necessary against some of denver s four man rushes. it will be interesting to see what happens on the backside of those full line slides. say the o line slides right, toward von miller. that leaves dickson and the running back doubling demarcus ware on the left. dickson and the backs are accustomed to blocking blitzing safeties and linebackers facing an eight time pro bowl defensive end is a much taller order, even if it is a two on one battle. photo : helen h. richardson the denver post via getty imagesbrady was sacked four times by the broncos and hurried into awkward throws on multiple other occasions. using a max protection against a four man rush can be perilous because it leaves seven defenders guarding the remaining three eligible receivers. ( these seven on three advantages are what the giants used to capitalize on with their nascar pass rush. ) in the broncos case, it s extra valuable because they play so much man coverage. ask yourself : when the panthers go max protection, what happens with the man defenders who are assigned to the no. 2 tight end and running back? in denver s scheme, this is generally linebackers danny trevathan and brandon marshall. if the tight end and back stay in as blockers, trevathan and marshall, instead of just standing and watching, could blitz. ( in football parlance, this is known as a green dog blitz? the broncos do it often. ) or when the tight end and back block, trevathan and marshall could spy newton, eliminating the quarterback s scrambles. that would force newton to stay in the pocket that ware and miller are collapsing. newton would surely have to hold the ball here because not only would there be two linebackers eyeing him underneath, but there d also be two safeties playing over the top. that s in addition to three superb corners? chris harris, aqib talib and bradley roby? shadowing the wide receivers. the more you think about that scenario, the more more troubling it becomes for carolina. so what will newton, offensive coordinator mike shula and coach ron rivera do? will they consider calling fewer max protections and hoping their o linemen can survive in a six man protection? or even in the occasional minimum five man protection? the difference is far greater than simply having one fewer guy blocking. in max protection, with the entire o line sliding one way, those linemen are zone blocking. but in a six man protection, some linemen will have to go one on one as man blockers. you can t slide all five linemen against a straight four man rush because the extra blocker? either a tight end or running back? is left one on one against the defensive end ( the ultimate mismatch ). the panthers line kept newton mostly clean against the cardinals. carolina s offensive line has overachieved this season, but its individual members would not fare well 	 0

Dover , DE ( BNSE ) : Justice Department investigators confirmed today they are considering possible fines and other penalties against several of the United States ' largest financial institutions for the murders of hundreds of homeowners delinquent in their mortgage payments .The Justice Department responded to complaints from families of recent murder victims claiming to receive billing statements from the deceased ' s mortgage companies demanding payment for " ammunition services , " " break in and terrorizing administrative charges , " and " blood removal and dry cleaning fees , " among other charges related to " Mortgage Remediation Services . "According to a Justice Department spokesman , " The Department is taking these accusations very seriously . While the laws regulating just how aggressive lending companies can act in their efforts to collect a dept are very broad , the actual legality of physically killing individuals behind on their payments is rather vague . Congress and the Courts have consistently ruled that large financial institutions can do whatever they want whenever they want , but , the authority to just kill people for very little reason is a power normally reserved to the federal government . "Officials for several of the largest banks were quick to defend the policy . " Banks have a right and obligation to protect their assets and manage them in a way to yield the highest profitability , " said one well known CEO . " The simple fact is there are some people out there who are not prepared for home ownership and its responsibilities . Some of these people were two , even three days late on their payments . What are we supposed to do ? Wait around to Thursday , even Friday , so these deadbeats can meet their obligations ?" Government regulation is making it nearly impossible for lending institutions to maximize their investments . It ' s hard to believe , but in almost every state now , you actually have to prove that your bank owns the property your trying to repossess . Until recently that was an easy problem to fix , but thanks to the liberal media , Courts are actually requiring that any legal documents you produce must be real . This is insane ! How are we supposed to make any money when we have to prove that it is actually owed to us ? A simple foreclosure that used to take just a few days will now take months , even years to complete . When you look at the facts you can plainly see that the only legal solution available to us is to just hire some guys to go in and kill everyone who lives in a house . When the home owner is dead , the foreclosure process speeds up drastically which enables us to bring the returns our investors have come to expect . "A local branch manager for a large mortgage company also voiced support for the policy , " Everyone likes to make the people we kill out to be victims . Trust me , they ' re not . Every time we break into a house late at night we offer to let the family live if they can give us the entire amount owed on their mortgage to us in cash . Hell , if they ' d do that we ' d probably let them off easy with a few rapes and castrations of all the males . But , no . . . There has not been a single family who has chosen to work with us . They ' d rather die than pull two hundred G ' s out from under the bed . That really shows you just how serious they are about paying their bills . "Congressional leaders expressed concern over the Justice investigation . " I ' m not saying the banks don ' t deserve a good slap on the wrists for this , " said a high ranking Republican . " But , we have to be cautious that we do not overreact to this situation and actually hurt the already fragile financial system . A reasonable fine , a few promises to reform their policies at an unidentified point in the future should be more than adequate in addressing this issue . Particularly when you consider how even handed the banks have been in the execution of this policy . Statistics show that over 85 if the murdered families have been ethnic minorities . A few hundred dead blacks and Hispanics ? That ' s like a weekend in Detroit . They don ' t vote for us anyway . Seriously , a few hundred people die every day in America chocking on chicken bones . I don ' t see anyone running around trying to sue chickens . " 	 1

Official photographs of the king have also shown him in a wheelchair .The health of the monarch is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of one of the world ' s largest oil producers .Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with no elected parliament . The king has sole power to ratify legislation and appoint ministers .The king reportedly underwent surgery in October 2011 and November 2012 for his back at the same hospital he was admitted to today . He also had two back surgeries in 2010 in New York .Absolute monarchy : The health of King Abdullah , pictured in 2006 , is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of Saudi ArabiaHis 79 year old successor and half brother , Crown Prince Salman , has increasingly represented the kingdom in meetings abroad , including the latest Gulf summit in Qatar this month .As deputy prime minister and defence minister , he has also increasingly presided over cabinet meetings at home .The king ' s latest hospitalisation comes as Saudi Arabia holds a high profile position in the US led fight against the Islamic State group , which has seized swathes of neighbouring Iraq and Syria .Saudi warplanes have joined in coalition air strikes against the jihadists in Syria , although the ultra conservative Muslim kingdom has faced calls to do more to halt the flow of funds and fighters to IS from among its own citizens .The king has outlived two other half brothers who held the crown prince post .Under his guidance , a council comprised of the sons and some grandsons of modern Saudi Arabia ' s founder , King Abdul Aziz Al Saud , was activated and in March selected King Abdullah ' s half brother Prince Muqrin , 69 , as second in line to the throne .The king officially assumed the throne in 2005 , becoming the sixth king of Saudi Arabia , but had been widely viewed as the de facto ruler since the mid 1990s .As king , he holds the post of prime minister and commander of the National Guard . 	 0
" It ' s just the plays that are dialed up by B . A . , " he said . " Carson ( Palmer ) found me on the field and I made plays . "Larry Fitzgerald and Floyd make an imposing tandem . Fitzgerald stands 6 foot 3 , Floyd 6 foot 2 . Combined with diminutive speedster John Brown , it ' s a formidable force for opponents to deal with ." You think about Larry as the first guy you think about in this offense , " Palmer said . " Then with all the attention that Smoke ( Brown ) gets , having a thousand yards and all those things , he ( Floyd ) is kind of the third guy you think about , probably naturally , and I don ' t think that bothers him . I think he enjoys that because he ends up walking away last week with two touchdowns . So much focus goes to Larry , it leaves him one on one a lot . "There seems to be zero jealousy among the receivers ." We all just like each other , on and off the field , " Floyd said . " It doesn ' t matter who gets all the praise and glory . Somehow , you contributed to the win , and that ' s how we look at it . "Floyd , the 13th overall pick out of Notre Dame in 2012 , caught 65 passes for 1 , 041 yards in 2013 , Arians ' first season in Arizona . Last year , his numbers dipped to 47 catches for 841 yards , thanks partly to the Cardinals ' quarterback issues after Palmer and backup Drew Stanton went down with season ending injuries .The Cardinals obviously value what Floyd brings . Last year they picked up the option on his contract for the 2016 season ." He brings a guy that ' s physical ( as a blocker ) in the run game . He ' s physical with the ball in his hands , " Palmer said . " He ' s a guy that can make the play with the ball in his hands after the catch , and break a tackle here and there . He ' s a mismatch , week in and week out . It doesn ' t matter who the corner is . "In last weekend ' s win over the Packers , Floyd ' s first touchdown was an eight yard toss from Palmer that he caught in the back corner of the end zone , keeping his feet inbounds as he ran . The second TD catch gave Arizona a 17 13 lead in the fourth quarter and was most fortuitous .With the ball at the Packers ' 8 yard line , Palmer threw over the middle toward Fitzgerald at about the 3 yard line . But Green Bay ' s Demetrius Randall deflected the ball off his forearm . The ball sailed perilously into the end zone and right into Floyd ' s hands .Floyd said that with such depth at wide receiver , someone should be open or at least in a one on one situation on every pass ." The ball can be distributed any way , " he said . " You never know who ' s going to have a breakout game . It could be Fitz one day . It could be John making plays . It could be anyone . . . . It ' s a great thing to have . " 	 0
new york in a deal that spared him capital punishment for his alleged orchestration of the 9 11 attacks, former al qaeda operative khalid sheikh mohammed reluctantly accepted a judge's alternative sentence requiring him to coach a disorderly youth baseball team, sources confirmed wednesday. a court brief made public this week has revealed that last year, federal judge jonathan ward ordered mohammed to manage the 0 6 rockets of the sayville, long island, little league for 60 days, saying that he hoped the onetime terrorist network leader might be able to learn some valuable lessons by working with the troubled but pugnacious 12 year olds. the team had developed a reputation in the league for poor play and mischievous behavior, local sources said, and were in desperate need of a coach after their previous three quit in frustration. " all right, guys, let's get something straight i don't want to be here, and you don't want to be here, so let's just try to get this season over with, " the organizer of the deadliest terror attack in modern history reportedly said when first meeting the rambunctious youngsters in their overgrown practice field, where trash can lids were used as bases and the entire team was sharing a single worn out ball. " the u. s. district court for southern new york says that for the next two months you guys are my problem, so let's lay down some ground rules. you can call me coach m. there's no more fighting, no more swearing, and no more stealing gear from the other team. got it? " now, which one of you knuckleheads is my shortstop? he continued. mohammed, who arrived with the same beat up glove he had used since high school, is said to have spent the first practice looking on in disgust as his players missed wildly on throws to first base, allowed grounders to roll between their legs, and collided while chasing fly balls in the outfield. he was later seen burying his head in his hands when a player swung at a pitch, missed, and accidentally sent his bat flying into the bleachers. according to league records, the team lost their first five games under the radical islamist, who spent most of his time smoking cigarettes in the dugout. when they played the first place, undefeated knights, a team from across town, the rockets reportedly gave up 15 runs before instigating a bench clearing brawl in the fourth inning. witnesses confirmed that this was one of several occasions in which the dumbfounded coach was overheard saying that he " should have just chosen the execution. " " come on, sabatino, get it together. " the former head of propaganda for osama bin laden shouted at his overweight, loudmouthed catcher when, during one of the team's many blowouts, the boy let a pitch sail by him because he became distracted by a group of girls in the stands. " what'd i tell you about keeping your eye on the game? it's all about focus, focus, focus! that goes for all of you. " " or are you goofballs content being the laughingstock of the whole damn league? he added. sayville residents told reporters that the rockets reached a turning point midseason not long after mohammed, walking home from another disappointing loss, spotted a boy hurling rocks through the windows of an abandoned warehouse. recognizing the young misfit's powerful arm, the veteran mujahid recruited him on the spot, and during the following day's practice, the team reportedly looked on in wide eyed amazement as the boy delivered a fastball with such velocity that it sent the catcher tumbling onto his back. united behind their new ace pitcher, the team reportedly began to climb in the standings, and according to witnesses, a reenergized mohammed started to forge a bond with his young players, even providing the rockets with brand new team uniforms paid for by members of the saudi royal family. around the same time, sources reported, mohammed began to fall for the beautiful single mother of his shy first baseman. " you know, i used to be a lot like you guys when i was younger, " the longtime guant namo and cia black site inmate said to the kids seated in his rusted old dodge caravan as he took them on a long road trip to an away game. " i used to feel frustrated and resentful all the time, and it seemed like no one was listening. i started hanging around with the wrong kind of guys, and we ended up doing some really dumb things. i guess i just don't want to see you guys make the same mistakes i made. " " oh, man, somebody open a window, " he added several moments later. following a magical run through the playoffs which saw home run saving catches, near perfect pitching, and the successful deployment of their " sayville surprise trick pickoff play in the semifinals the rockets were 	 1
The world ' s leading nature magazine , National Geographic , announced it will publish its last edition in December .The announcement has startled the publishing world .Circulation of the National Geographic has increased 6 every year for the last three years and revenues remain strong , however , according to Chief Editor , Antoinette Farger , it is time to halt production" There are no more remaining natural places or wild animals left on Earth . The world is paved with monotonous subdivisions , people eat at chain restaurants , and the planet overrun by pigeons . Hasn ' t anyone noticed , that the lion on the front cover of the March edition was Cecil , and we used him in 1998 , 2002 and 2007 ?" He was the only lion left in the African savannah and that dentist from Minnesota went and shot him right between the eyes . What a jerk ! Now we don ' t even have Cecil to pose for us . It ' s time to call it quits while we still have a smidgen of journalistic integrity . "Approximately 500 people working on the " creative " side of the magazine will be laid off .Ms . Farger explained that for years National Geographic has employed an army of graphic designers , IT animators , and science fiction writers to imagine wild animals in natural habitats ." I feel horrible for our fantastic crew working with Adobe Photoshop and Corel Paint Shop software , the IT team of animators , and of course our great writers they are the best ! They did a great job of using their imagination and made millions believe natural places and wild animals really exists but it ' s over . Hopefully they can be reassigned to our sister journal NASA Today . "Ms . Farger suggested the magazine might re emerge under a new brand and publish stories reflecting today ' s environment .When pressed for specifics , she listed a few possible articles the new magazine could publish , including : Stay Cool , It ' s Only Global Warming How to Keep Cool While Denying Global Warming Cities are Natural Places Too or , perhaps , Who Needs Wildlife Anyway ! 	 1
India has long been cited as one of the fastest growing economies in the world , but it hasn ' t always been the most hospitable place for business travelers .Ranked 132 out of 185 on the World Bank ' s Ease of Doing Business Index , the country is often viewed as a hassle by executives . Part of the problem is that India has grown faster than its infrastructure ." Infrastructure that we created for 2020 are already getting filled up by 2012 , " says Amitabh Kant , the man who is planning to bring India up to speed by 2017 .Kant already revolutionized his country once . The instigator of the " Incredible India " campaign , he polished India ' s flagging tourism image and turned it into a must visit destination for the discerning traveler .Marketing aside , the campaign made sure journeying through the subcontinent was met with relative ease . Roads were repaved , landmarks rebuffed and the sector as a whole was trained to work with foreign guests . Today , the country sees 6 . 8 million overseas tourists annually .Now he is tackling what may be India ' s most ambitious infrastructure project to date . The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor , a 90 billion state run enterprise , will involve connecting the 932 mile stretch between Delhi and Mumbai with new ports , airports , highways and rail links .For Kant , though , the real achievement will be the undertaking ' s economic knock on effect ." The train opens up a completely new route for India , " he explains . " It opens up the heart of six states , and what it does is really drive manufacturing . It creates seven new industrial cities of India , " he explains .The country has already seen several new cities develop on the outskirts of industry centers . Outside of Delhi , for example , sits Gurgaon , a 30 year old suburb with a GDP that has started to match its next door neighbor ' s . Unfortunately , many key urban features like adequate power and sewage are only just starting to be built ." The city is doing some retro fitting , " admits Kant . " You are seeing power lines coming up , you are seeing drainage and sewage coming up . "Kant is hoping to avoid this type of scenario with the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor ." You need to have a very good plan of the backbone of the city you ' ve created , and then allow the private sector to come in at the appropriate time , " says Kant .The project may be ambitious , but Kant notes that its supersonic timeframe is necessary given the speed the country ' s young population is growing ." India has a very young population the median age is 25 , and the aspirations are very high , " he explains . " We have to push for reforms at twice the speed we have been doing . "Despite the wealth of foreign investment in India , Kant also notes that the drive for change is coming from within the country . India ' s middle class is 400 million strong , and Kant reckons that by 2021 it will account for 47 of the country ' s GDP . Many will likely work in cities , and the number is only going to keep growing ." By 2030 , 350 million Indians are going to get into the process of urbanization , 700 million Indians by 2050 , " he explains . " India has to create two and a half Americas . That is the challenge for India . " 	 0
DEARBORN , MI Laid off Monday from his billing manager position at Automatic Data Processing , Howard Pfaff reported that his exit interview with human resources associate Lorraine Bochy " went pretty well . "" After getting the pink slip , I wasn ' t exactly looking forward to doing my exit interview , " said Pfaff , 39 , who had worked in ADP ' s billing services department for 11 years before budget cuts eliminated his position . " But it actually wasn ' t that bad . Lorraine asked me all sorts of questions about my overall job satisfaction during my years with ADP and if there was anything I ' d do different if I were the boss . I was afraid maybe she was going to criticize me , but all in all , it was pretty cordial . "Continued Pfaff : " Lorraine explained that exit interviews are an extremely valuable way for the company to determine what changes need to be made to improve the work environment for future employees . That made pretty good sense to me . "Also encouraging to the newly unemployed Pfaff was Bochy ' s " great regret " that the company had to let him go ." She said it had nothing to do with my job performance , which , according to my file , rated either ' fair ' or ' good ' for every quarter since I was hired , " said Pfaff , who had never met Bochy prior to the interview . " So that made me feel a little better , I guess . "Bochy informed Pfaff that the typed list of questions she held was " merely a launching point " and that the two could talk about whatever he wanted ." I told Lorraine a few things but , to be honest , I didn ' t want to be too critical , " Pfaff said . " Sure , there were a lot of things about working at ADP that I hadn ' t been too thrilled about , like the lack of inter departmental communication and the frequent overtime , but I didn ' t really know if I should go into it . Especially since I ' m still sort of hoping that maybe the budget cuts will be lifted and I ' ll get rehired . "According to Pfaff , the highlight of the exit interview was seeing his permanent employee file for the first time ." That was kind of neat , to be able to see what ' s been in my secret file all these years , " Pfaff said . " They had all this weird stuff in there , like a copy of my medical records . And a picture of me at a 1991 company picnic that must have been clipped out of the monthly newsletter . When I saw that , I was like , ' Huh . ' "Pfaff said he was even more interested in what wasn ' t in the file ." I was afraid there was going to be some kind of mention of that one week last year when I got in late four days in a row because my car was at the mechanic , " he said . " I remember that , at the time , I was really worried I ' d get in trouble for that , but I couldn ' t find a single mention of it . "Pfaff said the file was not necessarily an accurate representation of his job performance , asserting that the best things he had done during his years with Automatic Data Processing were not included ." There was a hand written complaint in there saying that I ' d been disturbing coworkers by playing my radio in my cubicle . That came as a total surprise to me , because no one ever once asked me to turn it down , " Pfaff said . " As for my steady productivity over the years , there really wasn ' t any mention . I ' d always assumed they kept track of how many accounts each one of us billing managers handled each month . I guess they don ' t . "In the final minutes of the interview , Bochy informed Pfaff that he could count on a good reference from the company , a subject Pfaff had been nervously anticipating ." Lorraine said , ' I don ' t see any reason why you would receive a negative reference from anyone here at Automatic Data Processing . Unless , of course , there ' s something I don ' t know , ' " Pfaff said . " I ' m pretty sure that second part was meant to be a joke . "As Pfaff exited the ADP human resources office , a smiling Bochy shook his hand and said , " Good luck , Howard . "" I guess there was nothing to be nervous about , " Pfaff said . " Lorraine was really nice . She even said she hopes that someday in the future , we can work together again . " 	 1
ST . LOUIS Calling Friday night ' s victory on baseball ' s grandest stage " a terrible mistake , " members of the St . Louis Cardinals issued a formal apology for making the playoffs , winning the World Series , and depriving baseball fans everywhere of a season featuring the kind of heartwarming , storybook ending to which they have grown accustomed in recent years ." I ' m still struggling to understand how this could have happened , " said a sober Tony La Russa during a press conference following Game 5 . " It seemed all but certain coming into this series that we were going to be a part of something truly special , that we would easily put the finishing touches on a magical season that inspired millions of fans around the country , but instead we somehow ended up winning . "" It ' s disappointing , to say the least , " La Russa added . " We were rooting for the Detroit Tigers just like everyone else . "According to Cardinals players , they " tried absolutely everything " in their pursuit to earn the Tigers their first world championship since 1984 , including eliminating the far more dangerous New York Mets in the NLCS , entering the series completely unrested after a grueling seven game series , starting a rookie pitcher with five career wins in Game 1 in Detroit , and postponing Game 4 due to rain in the hopes that an off day would swing the momentum back in the Tigers ' favor ." I don ' t know what we could ' ve done differently , " second baseman Ronnie Belliard said . " We gave the Tigers every opportunity to win ballgames , but when their pitchers keep making errors on simple ground balls , what are we supposed to do , pretend we forgot the rules and start running to third base ? "Desperate for a Tigers win in Game 2 , the Cardinals chose to overlook the fact that starter Kenny Rogers was pitching with the aid of a foreign substance on his left hand ." Of course we all knew it was pine tar , but it seemed like they were finally finding their rhythm We certainly didn ' t want to shake their confidence , so we decided to just let it go , " La Russa said . " Frankly , if the umpires didn ' t bring it up , we probably would ' ve let him pitch with it the whole game . "After the final out of the World Series was recorded , the stunned Cardinals retreated to their dugout and watched with disappointed , glazed over expressions as the Detroit Tigers the feel good team of the season whom everyone expected to win it all packed up their equipment in the dugout across the diamond .According to Albert Pujols , some teammates took the World Series victory harder than others ." For a lot of young guys like Anthony Reyes and Yadier Molina , this was their first chance to see an exciting , inspirational , and truly deserving team win a championship , " Pujols said . " Even though the outcome of this series has definitely left a bad taste in my mouth , I can handle it , because I was there in 2004 when we were able to see Red Sox beat us in the World Series . Man , what an incredible feeling that was Just watching those guys celebrate , I really felt like I was seeing history unfold before my eyes . It was definitely my greatest baseball moment . "" I hope we have the chance to see something like that again next year , " Pujols added .Reporters and sportswriters around the nation were critical of many of La Russa ' s successful managerial decisions , second guessing such effective moves as leaving staff ace Chris Carpenter in for more than five innings in Game 3 , and failing to bench third baseman Scott Rolen , who batted a team high . 421 in the series . La Russa , however , said that things would be different next year ." I think I speak for my players , the front office , the coaching staff , and every fan in St . Louis when I say that all season long , we had just one goal : bringing a championship to the great city of Detroit , " La Russa said . " And even though we failed this time around , we will be committed to achieving similar goals next season . "In the somber clubhouse following the victory , Cardinals centerfielder Jim Edmonds admitted that " the wrong team won , " but said that the outcome of the 2006 World Series is " just something we ' re unfortunately going to have to live with . "" Nobody thought we could do this , nobody thought we could stop this powerhouse team that beat the odds to go from worst to first and rolled through the playoffs looking like they were invincible , " Edmonds said . " And we thought we had taken every possible step to prove them right . "" We shocked the world , " Edmonds added . " We ' re sorry . " 	 1

I have never known this in the past , ' said De Gea .' We ' ve had so much bad luck and it ' s made it difficult to maintain the high level of consistency and performance that we need .' As a keeper it ' s important to form a good understanding with your back four and become familiar with each other ' s positions on the pitch .' It ' s difficult when the players aren ' t there but you have to adapt and concentrate on your job .' The experience has definitely helped me improve .

The militant fighters of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) have been engaged in a campaign of violence against the Turkish state for more than two decades with the goal of establishing an autonomous Kurdish homeland .PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan , pictured in 1992 . Ocalan is currently serving a life sentence in a Turkish prison .The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood .More than half of the world ' s Kurds ( 10 to 12 million ) are estimated to live in Turkey , making up a majority in the country ' s south eastern region . Iraq , Iran and Syria also have sizeable Kurdish minorities .But the group is considered a terrorist organization by the U . S . and the European Union and is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30 , 000 Turkish security force members and civilians , according to the U . S . State Department .In 1984 the PKK launched a guerrilla struggle in response to the wave of repression that followed Turkey ' s military coup in 1980 when the Kurdish language and Kurdish place names banned . By then the group ' s founder , Abdullah Ocalan , was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps .Since the 1980s the group has claimed responsibility for regular ambushes on military targets in the southeast but also bomb attacks across the country , notably in Turkish holiday resorts .During the 1990s the Turkish military launched a concerted campaign to eliminate the PKK threat , adopting commando tactics and targeting the group ' s mountain bases .The establishment of a " no fly zone " over northern Iraq following the first Gulf War in 1991 also allowed Turkish troops to conduct frequent raids on PKK strongholds across the border .In 1998 , under intensive Turkish pressure , Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there . Ocalan was snatched by Turkish commandos a few months later while seeking asylum in Kenya .Despite calling for a PKK cease fire and peaceful negotiation following his capture , Ocalan was sentenced to death in 1999 following a trial condemned by the European Court of Human Rights .However his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment when Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002 . In the same year Ocalan ' s brother , Osman Ocalan , who had inherited leadership of the PKK , vowed to form a new group to campaign peacefully for Kurdish rights .But the frequency of PKK terror attacks has steadily risen since 2004 and Turkey claims the U . S . led invasion of Iraq and the country ' s subsequent instability following the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 has enabled the PKK to regroup .It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq .Earlier this year Turkey sent large contingents of soldiers , tanks , guns and armored personnel carriers to reinforce its frontier .But following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks , Turkish military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at PKK bases inside Iraq .

Susan Boyle has never been able to copulate with a man and after visiting the doctor she was told why . She was diagnosed with Asperger ' s syndrome which prevents her from becoming sexually aggressive with men .The diseases is a mild form of autism and affects social interaction and communication skills .Boyle , now 52 , suffers from strong sexual desires she can ' t satisfy because men are not attracted to women her age . Her inability to communicate with men for casual sex is causing her depression and desperation because she is unable to lose her virginity or have children .As a child , Boyle experienced learning disabilities she was told resulted from oxygen deprivation at birth when her large head got stuck in her mum ' s birth canal . Doctors had to grease her head with pig lard to make it easier for her frumpy body and over sized head to squeeze through her mum .A year ago , she sought the advice of a specialist who determined she had an above average IQ ." When I was a wee lass , I was told I had brain damage . It was the wrong diagnosis for someone so young , " she told the Star . " I always knew it was an unfair label . Now I have a clearer understanding of what ' s wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself . "Boyle became an overnight celebrity in 2009 when her audition for " Britain ' s Got Talent " went viral . In the clip , the modest church volunteer wowed a skeptical panel of judges , including Simon Cowell , with her rendition of " I Dreamed a Dream " from " Les Mis rables . "After finishing in second place on the reality competition show , an " emotionally drained and exhausted " Boyle was admitted to the Priory Hospital , a psychiatric clinic in London . Cowell send her a letter saying she would have won first place if she had only wore a paper bag over her head .She has since become a top selling recording artist and also recently appeared in a small role in a religious themed film as an old maid turned she devil . 	 1
STOCKHOLM 2007 was an extraordinary year for former vice president Al Gore , who received the highest honors in both film and humanitarianism for his tireless efforts in creating a visually pleasing , hour long slide show presentation using the popular computer program Keynote .The slide show , which features approximately 80 full color pictures of landforms and people , as well as a vast array of detailed line and bar graphs , proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that a successful visual presentation must utilize both an application ' s audio and graphic capabilities . Furthermore , Gore effectively silenced many of his critics by incorporating short videos ." The Nobel Committee was deeply moved by Mr Gore ' s passion for making a clear , concise , easy to watch slide show , " Professor Geir Lundestad , director of the Nobel Institute , told reporters in late October . " The slide show truly displayed how well placed transitions be they dissolves , wipes , or splits can really tie a presentation together . "Added Lundestad : " Also , the slides with multi image animation were cool . "In February , Gore ' s montage of satellite images and title slides was awarded an Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and was hailed for presenting a " truly global message " with a clear beginning , middle , and end ." I was stunned , " said Phoenix resident Amy Swinton , 23 , who saw the slide show twice in theaters . " It turns out that you don ' t always need flashy fonts or background colors to make a great multimedia presentation . Simple white text on an all black background can be very effective . "Swinton later called the slide show extremely informative , saying that over the course of two hours she was completely convinced of the reality of Keynote ' s " bounce " slide transition option ." I think these awards will help give even more weight to Mr Gore ' s ultimate message , " New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote . " In our changing world , it is absolutely essential that all of us do our part to stay informed about the various eye catching possibilities of today ' s slide show software . " 	 1
new york there's no shortage of diners in new york city, but one of its most beloved will soon be taking up residence in alabama. the cheyenne diner, which opened in 1940 in new york city, shut its doors in april 2008. the cheyenne diner, which first opened in 1940, was split in two monday night to begin its move on a pair of flatbed trucks some 860 miles to its new home near birmingham. the dining experience at the cheyenne was typical of many similar new york eateries, where more often than not, you're guaranteed a hearty meal at a comfortable price. after taking a seat in a roomy booth or even at the counter, you check out the flimsy paper placemat with innocuous historical information or a simplified map of the greek isles. a busboy places a glass of ice water on your table. then it's time to break out the reading glasses and flex those muscles to heft the always lengthy menu. while it may take you several minutes to sift through it, take comfort in knowing that you may actually burn some calories by lifting this bible of comfort food. unlike the sometimes stuffy pretense of a formal restaurant, the diner experience is generally simple, while the food offerings are diverse from apple pie to baked ziti and everything in between. while never known as a bastion for fine dining, the cheyenne saw brighter days before it unceremoniously closed on a chilly sunday in april 2008. originally known as the market diner until its moniker was changed in 1986, the pre assembled restaurant stood as a rare classic definition of free standing diners. its streamlined, railcar inspired design boasts a reverse channel illuminated neon sign. horizontal and vertical stainless steel strips border the colorful enamel panels and wrap around windows on its facade. celebrities from jerry lewis to david letterman entered through its curved entryway lined with glass blocks. but, like a beloved baseball team whose owner has tossed in the towel, the cheyenne is moving to a new town for a new life in a new home. the owner of the diner, george papas, wanted to change the flavor of the block and replace the eatery with a multilevel condo building. enter preservationist michael perlman, a 26 year old patron saint of sorts for unwanted diners. perlman found out that the cheyenne was facing demolition and began to look for a guardian angel to save it. he connected with alabama businessman joel owens, head of the investment group naic, who saw the cheyenne for sale on a web site devoted to the preservation of new york city structures and fell in love with its " gorgeous structure. " " i like it better each time i see it, " owens said. " the barrel roof. the exterior facades are second to none. i think it's the most beautiful diner in the world. " owens and his business associate, patti miller, have a grand vision for the diner and eventually want to incorporate it as part of an entertainment and historic area outside of birmingham. once it's restored, which could take up to a year, the cheyenne will become the first free standing diner in alabama, owens said. a longtime collector of antique cars and coca cola memorabilia, owens is a firm believer in the lessons that can be learned from the past. " if you think about what's wrong with today, in order to fix the problems of today, you've got to look back... to when it was better, " owens said. " i think the diner is symbolic of the glory days. technology and more money doesn't necessarily mean progress. we long for simpler times, " he explained. " these types of buildings can be an instrument for our youth to learn from the past. teenagers need a clean environment for entertainment, a'hang out.'" the departure of the cheyenne diner brings back some bitter memories for aficionados of historic new york. the moondance diner encountered a similar fate in 2007, after it was put up for sale by developers who purchased the land it was sitting on and planned to build a hotel. that summer, a couple from wyoming found the moondance's sale notice on the american diner museum web site. perlman acted as a conduit there also, helping to broker the sale of the 1920s diner located in the soho section of manhattan, which the couple planned to move to their home state. when news of the sale and move came out, the pierces began to have some doubts. " we're quiet people, " said cheryl pierce, of la barge, wyoming. " but the media response has been a blessing as people have shown a keen interest. " pierce and her husband paid 7, 500 for the moondance and ultimately invested 40, 000 to move it more than 2, 100 miles to la barge, where it became a popular site in the town of 600 residents with few other restaurants. the barrel roofed diner reopened on january 12 	 0
It has been announced that the traditional King James Bible is to be revised into a modern day language " Bible App , " available for i Pads , I Phones and Android for 89p .Its aim is to get young people interested in mainstream traditional religious belief , and this drastic action is being taken due to plummeting church attendances by people under the age of 60 . This joint venture between the Church of England and The Vatican , they hope , will result in getting millions more " bums on seats " at Sunday services .In the same way that the current bible is made up of stories that were hundreds of years old before been written , then the revised new version will add modern day scenario ' s to replace the stuffy , dull stories from the off putting original .Its a gamble for the " big two " but a spokesman for the Vatican ' s accountants handling the switchover said , " If this comes off , it could make the churches some serious wonga . Imagine all those new customers flocking to church every week , it could pull in millions . It could be that big , we might even have to get Goldman Sachs to sort out our tax affairs "In a bid to make the change happen , both sides have hired top rappers in a 4 . 5m contract to turn church attendances around , by translating the old bible into modern day speak ." The rap stars have a three year contract , yeh , to rewrite all of da current bible gubbins to a bang tidy 21st century standard , and I mean ALL of that stuff , even that weird shit with the dead guy that runs around after been dead for a bit . . . Larry Zeus , or some shit like that , well him " the Vatican ' s hip hop spokesman announced .At the time of going to press we were only able to obtain a leaked memo outlining a revised version of how a story from the good book , would translate into modern day language for the app .The famous bible quote that had been modernised was " Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . " Matthew 7 : 12 , has been amended to read " So I was like Bro , do you want someone to do that to you huh ? , then dont yo be doing that to them yer hear , or some bitch gonna slap yo sorry bad ass one day " .More when we get it . 	 1
Wall Street is more than 10 , 000 miles away from Melbourne , but 24 year old Australian Alex Gard felt a kinship to the outrage expressed on the streets of Manhattan ." It ' s great that people are finally standing up against the privileged few people who want to rule together , " Gard said . " I wanted to stand together and say , Enough is enough ' . "Gard is one of the organizers of " Occupy Melbourne , " a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2 , 000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square . Similar calls have sprung up around Australia : " Occupy Brisbane , " " Occupy Perth , " and " Occupy Sydney . "" We are inspired by what ' s happening on Wall Street and loosely liaising with each other , but it ' s not organized in any central way , " said Gard , who works as a mechanic on cargo ships .Gard and the planned Australian spin offs of " Occupy Wall Street " are not alone . There are Facebook calls for a global demonstration on October 15 in cities in more than 25 countries stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires , Dublin to Madrid .Some protest pages show only a few dozen will attend others have thousands . Protest pages in Spain and Italy two countries hard hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes have the largest Facebook attendees so far , with 42 , 410 and 20 , 568 , respectively ." Occupy Wall Street " began on September 17 and is now spreading to cities across the U . S . The demonstrations , inspired by the Arab Spring protest movement , are against economic inequality and power vested in the top 1 income earners . Its rallying cry , " We are the 99 percent , " is now being picked up by groups around the globe ." Occupy the London Stock Exchange " referring to Europe ' s largest bourse and the world ' s fourth largest exchange outside of New York and Tokyo has more than 6 , 000 followers ." It ' s time that we too say , enough is enough . Bankers have got off scot free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create , " said the group ' s Facebook invite page . The event , which so far has 2 , 300 signed up as attending , plans to occupy Paternoster Square from 4 p . m . October 15 to December 12 ." What we have in common is that we are the other 99 , that we want people over profit , that we are making our voices heard against greed and corruption and for a democratic and just society , " London organizer James Alexander Fancourt told the Telegraph newspaper . " And we are doing that in a non violent and peaceful way . "In Melbourne , " some demonstrators are planning to camp for days , maybe weeks , " Gard said .While the Australian economy driven by strong commodity sales of iron ore and coal escaped the brunt of the 2008 financial crisis , Gard said many Australians don ' t feel they ' re sharing in the wealth ." Look , Australia ' s not the worst place in the world , but we ' re seeing banks recording record profits , rental has been crazy , housing prices are going up and up , " Gar said . " Indigenous people are being moved off their own land for the sake of mining companies . . . everything is building up to a boiling point . " 	 0
( washington, dc ) in a surprise move, the republican national committee announced today that they have been purchased by bain capital investments. rnc chairman, reince priebus, says that bain had been purchasing shares in the rnc for the last year, but finally purchased the majority shares needed to have controlling interest in the association. " mitt romney has stated repeatedly that when he's elected president, that he'd use his business experience to run this country. the first step for that, of course, was gaining control of the rnc. we expect business to continue as usual, with very few changes. " an unidentified spokesman for bain, however, did say that there would be several changes to make the rnc more productive and cost effective. " one of the first things that we've done is to fire the long time mascot of the republican party, ollie the elephant. he's been with us a long time, but face it, with the crop failure this past year, we can't justify the cost of paying him peanuts. we have found an alternative mascot that, we believe, will better represent not only the party as a whole, including our supporters, but will be cost effective as well. " when asked who the new mascot will be, the spokesman replied that, " after looking over the credentials of several applicants, it was determined that the best animal to serve as our mascot will be a pig named reginald von hogg. " " reggie " it was explained, best exemplifies the true direction of the party in offering up pork projects to major corporations in no bid contracts that became the foundation of the last gop administration in washington. " we don't expect much in the way of problems with the tea party caucus in congress, as their backers are the ones that will profit most from this acquisition. " on the general side, it's been reported that " reggie " will represent the average republican voter in that he thrives on the swill and slop fed him. " face it : slop costs a lot less than peanuts ever did. " other changes in store for the republican party are : name of the party being changed from republican national convention to a more youth oriented name of government gone hog wild! there are a lot of young people today that don't bother to vote. we want them to get involved by voting for our candidates, regardless if they show up or not. as the new gghw, they expect many young men to become active in politics, and this new name will work wonders as many of them will mistake it for the girls gone wild videos. this is one time putting lipstick on a pig will work! downsizing staff in the old rnc. currently, we have too many highly paid people on staff that are redundant with the staff of bain capital. with mr romney joy at firing people, he's already passing out termination notices. we may hire some of them back at lower wages, on a part time basis so we don't have to pay them any benefits, thus stream lining the campaign process. of course, we are also looking into outsourcing a lot of the work. since china is already suffering from a labor shortage and mexico would be a poor choice due to immigration issues within this country, we have decided that all outsourcing will go to vietnam. while romney was able to shirk that duty during the war, there are enough people there that learned and speak english from the american occupation, as well as many that still speak french from the days when it was known as french indochina, will be beneficial for romney to communicate his needs. future expansion. as a job creator, bain capital looks to make the gghw with plans for future acquisitions. " we are pretty sure that we'll be able to acquire the us senate. once there, we do suspect that there will need to be some major cut backs. after all, where is the need to have two senators for every state? one should be sufficient. " after the senate, the gghw will then purchase the house of representatives. " we'll have some major trimming there, of course. once we've got that down to a manageable number, we'll purchase the supreme court and the executive office. " while the changes made in the house of representatives are still in process, the idea of cutting the supreme court down to three justices has already been decided. meanwhile, changed in the executive branch will include the elimination of the vice presidential post as well as outsourcing the cabinet. " really, all the vice president does is act as a tie breaker in the senate. if one is needed, we can always call someone like labor ready or manpower and have them send a temp over for the day. just think about the savings to the american taxpayer! " " also, we intend to move the cabinet offices from appointments to outsourced te 	 1

The real estate tycoon formerly known as Donald Trump has gone completely to the dark side and is now known as Darth Hirsutias .At a press conference from Traitors Towers , formerly Trump Towers , the dark lord Hirsutias explained the name change and his branding strategy ." The Trump brand is continuing to grow in value and I am only changing my personal name to reflect my dedication to the dark side . "Then addressing rumors about the disappearance of Chelsea Clinton , Hirsutias said ," Trump Empire Entertainment is holding Chelsea Clinton , and until the Clintons relinquish power , Chelsea will be held in a tremendously opulent suite at Traitors Towers .

harlem, ny globetrotters coaches announced monday that, due to his shockingly inappropriate on court behavior including taking trick shots designed to injure opponents, performing his signature globetrotter move of spinning two basketballs on his middle fingers, and throwing elbows after getting rebounds rudy " rude dude " williams has been suspended for the team's next three games. " we in the globetrotter organization pride ourselves on playing basketball in a spirit of good natured hijinks, if not complete fairness, and we regret that one of our players has fallen short of this standard, " a press release for the club read in part. " because mr williams hasn't learned to limit his shenanigans to traveling, goofing, and bouncing the ball off defenders'foreheads without doing serious cranial damage, he will not dress for our upcoming games against the washington generals, the washington generals, and the washington generals. " rude dude came to the harlem squad when coaches noticed that their opponents had a tendency to score more easily late in the second half of games, usually closing to within a mere two points and forcing the globetrotters to resort to unlikely heroics to win. it was decided a stronger defense was needed, and a contract was offered to rude dude, a former defensive standout at unlv. " in retrospect, it was a bad move, " said coach tex harrison, who recruited rude dude. " he was a low post player primarily, and not only was he unaccustomed to dribbling two balls at one time, he told us he found the entire practice to be'pretty damn stupid.'" according to harrison, rude dude took forever to grasp the intricacies of the figure eight offense. instead of letting the generals just follow him through the globetrotter weave, williams would set a pick, send opposing players crashing to the ground, and stand over them while flexing and taunting. in addition, whenever the globetrotter's theme song, " sweet georgia brown, " was played over the pa system, rude dude would reportedly just sit on the bench, loudly and deliberately whistling out of key. " we wanted toughness, yes, but a sort of funky, clowning toughness, " harrison said. " rude dude did not understand this. " in the past several months, complaints against williams have continued to mount. during a game in indianapolis, the globetrotters went into their famous football formation, an offensive scheme designed to confuse and disorient opponents due to the preposterous nature of football being played on the basketball court. when the basketball was " intercepted " by generals center james vilsaint, williams tackled him and drove him headfirst into the hardwood court, giving his opponent a severe concussion and a fractured collarbone. in the same game, williams, instructed to " get " a referee with a bucketful of confetti, grasped the official by the back of the neck and roughly shoved his head inside the bucket, holding him there until he passed out from oxygen deprivation. in what some say is his biggest failing as a globetrotter, williams has refused to place pre spun basketballs on children's fingers, often telling young fans to " spin it your own goddamn self. " in the rare instances in which he has put pre spun balls on their fingers, the results have been disastrous. " see that? that's me that did that, not you, " rude dude can be heard saying in a particularly infamous youtube clip in which he places a ball on the finger of a pigtailed and freckled 9 year old girl. " what, you gonna cry? you are, you're crying. jesus, i can't believe this shit, " the globetrotter says just before striking the girl's hand from below, sending the ball caroming out of the frame as the girl bursts into tears. the clip has been viewed more than 250, 000 times. " not everyone is cut out to be a globetrotter, " harlem gm nickolas cardinale told reporters. " but i've talked to rude dude, and he says he wants to make it work. i think he understands now that globetrotters can't get in fights with the bouncer at dave buster's, can't be in'stop snitching'videos, and i think he also understands that when we take female fans to center court to dance with them, they shouldn't be touched inappropriately. " " he wants to play here, " cardinale added. " but he also knows that we're open to trade offers. " thus far, only one team has shown interest in acquiring rude dude. " we'd love to have rude dude, " said red klotz, owner of the washington generals, a team that hasn't beaten the globetrotters since 1971. " frankly 	 1
The owner of a small Chinese restaurant business , MrWang Haichiko , had been fighting a takeover of his business by the restaurant giant Little Caesars Pizza , for more than 4 Months now . He had been making losses in his business and was slowly running out of money .The 63 year old man finally called Mike Ilitch , the private owner of Little Caesars Pizza , to settle the matter once and for all . After a long series of negotiations put forward by both sides , a decision was made . A thumb fight was to be held between the two .The following conditions were laid down . During the thumb fight , each opponent ' s unused arm was to be tied behind his back , to avoid any form of cheating . An official referee , pre approved by either sides was to be appointed to make sure that the competition was not botched .If Mike won the competition , MrWang would have to sign over his restaurant property to Mike . But , if MrWang won , Mike would have to write him a cheque ( check ) for an amount equal to the net worth of the Chinese restaurant .Two days later , on the eve of 29th March , a stage was set for a huge face off between the two . Posters were hung on walls , friends and families had gathered to witness the event . The participants were given motivational speeches by their respective coaches .The coach of Mike was heard saying , " It all comes down to this . All your hard work and exercises for building finger muscles by operating on your office keyboard , is finally going to pay off . Future generations will remember this day as THE DAY when Mike Ilitch defeated his nemesis in the greatest thumb fight of them all . History will be written tonight . Fight hard , Fight smart , and remember to pay me for my services . "In another corner , a nervous MrWang was being given a speech by his coach . For lack of a translator at the time , his speech cannot be mentioned .Finally the moment of truth arrived . A bell was heard and the two participants were asked to sit in chairs on either sides of a coffee table . Hands were shaken , mouthguards were put in and the left arms of both participants were safely tied behind their backs . Finally the thumb fight got underway .Both participants tried hard to lock each others ' thumbs under their own and hold it till the referee completed a 10 count . But for a long time , neither could hold it long enough . Sweat formed gradually on the brows of both men and trickled down their noses and cheeks and finally dropped to the floor from their chins . Friends and families standing around cheered them in slow motion . Dogs in the neighborhood stopped barking , the wind ceased to blow and the clock on the wall stopped ticking as the participants kept their eyes locked at each other , and tried to end the fight with a win .Suddenly , MrWang ' s eyes turned wide , looking totally horrified . His face grew paler and paler . He tried hard to free either of his hands . But both were secured tightly , one with a rope tied to his back , and the other engaged in the fight . After struggling a bit , the old man finally collapsed to the ground . The audience began to shout and the referee began blowing his whistle . Chaos followed . A paramedic standing nearby , just in case , ran in to help . After feeling his pulse for a second , he pronounced MrWang dead .A further investigation into the matter was conducted . Apparently , MrWang had died due to Asphyxia . He had accidentally swallowed and choked on his mouthguard .MrWang ' s only son , Chang , sat by his dead father and stared at Mike with vengeful eyes . 	 1
In a special address to the nation today , President George W . Bush has announced his plan for addressing the economic emergency caused by hyper inflation of the fiat US dollar and Congress ' runaway spending on war and entitlement programs .Mr Bush stated that the economic situation in the United States is dire enough to warrant declaring a national emergency . According to recently written Presidential Directives , this declaration has enabled Mr Bush to take on the role of absolute dictator ." I ' ve dreamed of this day for years , but I never realized I would be doing it for this reason . My fellow Americans , I had another dream just last night . It was a frightening dream , in which I saw what would happen to our country within a year unless drastic action is taken right now ." Our economic hemorrhage must be stemmed immediately , or else within a year , the United States will be in the depths of a depression that makes the Great Depression of the 1930s look like a cakewalk ." I am , therefore , declaring a state of national emergency , and taking on the role of dictator as of this moment . However , as I haven ' t got the foggiest notion what to do to correct our problems , my sole act as dictator is the appointment of Congressman Ron Paul as my successor . "Mr Bush went on to say that of all the members of the legislative branch , only Dr Paul has the depth of understanding of economics to right the ship of state ." Ron Paul now has full authority to single handedly enact emergency legislation as he sees fit , and I believe he will be able to bring us back to prosperity within a year . I also believe that before the end of that year , every citizen of the United States will be completely in favor of having Ron Paul remain in the White House for the rest of his life , " said Mr Bush .In a special briefing to the press following his televised address , Mr Bush told reporters that he expects Ron Paul to immediately send every member of the Federal Reserve board to the gallows , and to order every member of the US military now stationed out of country redeployed to the homeland and stationed wall to wall along the US Mexican border .Most astonishing to this reporter was seeing Bush break into anguished sobs as he lamented having allowed himself to stray so far from acting in the best interests of the country . He added , " But now , in the end , I know this all happened for the best , because I have complete faith in the ability of Ron Paul to set us on a positive course to peace , prosperity and freedom , as well as giving every American enough insight into the greatness of our wonderful Constitution , that our descendants will never face an emergency like the one we are in today . "Wonders never cease ! 	 1
LOS ANGELES COUNTY , CA " Maybe now everyone will remember the man for his achievements and legacy he ' s left behind , rather than his faults and his allegations , " said Macaulay Carson Culkin , of his close friend and " undercover lover " Michael Jackson ' s passing .A child molestation accusation came out in 1993 by Jordan Chandler against Michael Jackson . Long time child actor Macaulay Carson Culkin ( born August 26 , 1980 ) had taken the stand to testify on Jackson ' s behalf . Culkin acknowledged sleeping in Jackson ' s bed a dozen or more times between the ages of 9 and 14 , but insisted nothing of a sexual nature happened between the two . " I ' ve fallen asleep in the same bed with him , " Culkin said . " I ' d just flop down . " Culkin was asked whether the entertainer could have fondled him while he was sleeping . " As far as I know , he ' s never molested me , " Culkin testified . " I find that unlikely . " In a follow up , Culkin was asked if he had ever slept with any other 35 year old men . " Not that I remember , " the actor testified , " but I wasn ' t really friends with a lot of 35 year olds who actually understood me . "On January 1 , 1994 , Jackson settled with the Chandler family and their legal team out of court , in a civil lawsuit for 22 million . After the settlement Jordan Chandler refused to continue with Police criminal proceedings . Jackson was never charged , and the state closed its criminal investigation , citing lack of evidence .' YOU ARE NOT ALONE 'A smile comes over Culkin ' s face as he reflects back upon Michael and his time together ." Once , on top the Ferris wheel , Michael had told me about a time when he felt so alone , so out of touch with the world that he would sit in his HBC Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber for hours a day and just cry ." People that aren ' t rich and famous don ' t understand what a struggle it is to be successful , happy , and survive all at the same time , without allegations that would put you in an unfavorable light . " Culkin drops his head and mutters " You are not alone Michael , you know everyone mocks and pokes their fingers at Michael , but the reason he had began taking painkillers , Valium , Xanax and Ativan was to deal with the stress , of the prior sexual allegations , rehashing of childhood memories , not to mention the STRESS of the media , sheesh , could you really blame him ? "' YOUR MEMORY SHALL NEVER PASS , MAY YOUR DREAMS LIVE FOREVER 'Last year Jackson faced foreclosure on Neverland , the 2 , 500 acre ( 1 , 012 hectare ) property nestled in the hills of Santa Barbara County ' s wine country , 120 miles ( 193 kilometers ) northwest of Los Angeles . He was bailed out by Colony Capital , and months later transferred the deed to Neverland to Culkin , per Jackson ' s request ." We had so many plans for this majestic ranch . " Culkin pauses for a moment with a gulp then lowers his head and continues . " so many plans plans which will encourage more children to be open and aware of what life could bring them if they really believed in themselves . "Within the next two years , Culkin plans on converting the Neverland Ranch into a " haven " for " Children with Broken Dreams , " a non profit organization , which helps teach and protect endangered and exploited children ." Many of these children have been bounced from foster care system to foster care system and have no real conception of what " home " really is . "" Children with Broken Dreams " spokesperson Faith Wallace explains , " Since Michael was a boy he worked hard to get what he ' s gotten in life . He believed that there was something he could do to " change the world , " since our children are our future , why not start with them ? "Michael had begun the conversion of the Ranch in 1984 , but the renovations were put on hold when Jackson was told that he was suffering from alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency , a genetic condition that affects the lungs and liver . Jackson needed a lung transplant and was bleeding in the intestines . Jackson claimed that he couldn ' t see out of his left eye and was so winded that he could barely speak most of the time .Culkin vows to turn Michael ' s dreams into reality and to keep the conversion going on and make the changes that were spoken about back in 1984 ." It ' s the least I can do for a legend , mentor , and the love of my life Michael Jackson , " Culkin ' s eyes fills with tears as he continues , " Mike , your memory shall never pass , and your dreams shall live forever , I promise you this .

ABUJA , NIGERIA At a celebratory press conference Monday , President Olusegun Obasanjo announced that Nigeria ' s troubled but oil rich city of Warri has been chosen to host the 2008 Genocides ." Nigeria is excited for this chance to follow in the footsteps of Somalia , Rwanda , and Sudan , " Obasanjo said . " Much work remains to be done , but all of the building blocks are in place . Nigeria has many contentious ethnic groups , a volatile economy , and a dependence on food imports . We are well on our way to making 2008 a genocidal year to remember in Nigeria ! "Obasanjo acknowledged that many people considered Nigeria , a relatively stable West African nation , an unlikely candidate to host the Genocides ." With a multi party government transitioning from military to civilian rule , Nigeria is not a shoo in to host the Genocides , " Obasanjo said . " But last week ' s municipal election with ballot shortages and multiple accusations of vote tampering showed the world that Nigeria is , indeed , geared up for the unimaginable . "Oni Radhiya , a spokesman from the 2004 Genocide Board , said September ' s crippling polio outbreak may have helped Nigeria beat out the competition ." Sudan was a fantastic host this year the 2004 Genocides have really raised the bar , " Radhiya said . " For 2008 , many of us on the committee had our eyes on Tajikistan . The country ' s ongoing ethnic and religious strife made it a strong contender . But there was some concern that the conflict was as likely to simmer down as it was to boil over . "Radhiya added that Iraq was ruled out because the country is unlikely to exist three and a half years from now .UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said that , after a close examination of all bids , a Nigerian genocide " began to seem almost inevitable . "" Nigeria ' s stability has been repeatedly threatened by fighting between fundamentalist Muslims and Christians , " Annan said . " Five of Nigeria ' s seven political parties are extremist groups . The nation ' s ethnic Yoruba , Hausa , and Ibo populations of the oil rich Niger Delta area also show genocidal promise . "Annan said he first noticed the full genocidal potential of soon to be embattled Nigeria in September , when the Niger Delta People ' s Volunteer Force threatened to shut down oil production ." With so many poor and powerless people involved in messy , years old conflicts , the situation is likely to be ignored long enough for things to get really ugly , " Annan said . " And , of course , the slow to move , ineffectual UN will do everything it can to help shepherd Nigeria into a combined religious , political , and economic disaster of horrific proportions . "According to Nigerian officials , now that their country has secured the bid , the government has much work to do ." Don ' t think we ' ll just sit on our hands and wait for a crippling drought to pit neighbor against neighbor , " Nigerian Minister of State Bello Usman said . " No , the next two years will be crucial . We need to default on our 2 billion IMF loan , invest the entire treasury in the overhead heavy petroleum business , and turn a blind eye to regional guerrilla groups . That ' d be a good start . After that , food shipments must fall into rebel hands , armed forces must go unpaid , and the emerging national infrastructure must be allowed to deteriorate . "Added Usman : " There ' s a lot to accomplish , but I promise you this : By early 2008 , ashes will blacken the sky and blood will run in the streets . "According to Red Cross programming director Ellen Schumacher , genocide , once a spectacle that drew the attention of the entire world , has received less attention in recent years , drawing an ever diminishing Western audience ." The most glaring problem has been a time zone issue , since most of the proceedings take place during inconvenient , off peak viewing times , " Schumacher said . " But , as an oil rich nation , Nigeria is much more likely to build a viewer base in the West . Perhaps the country will even be able to get one of the networks to pony up for exclusive rights .

The Care Quality Commission has warned that carers and nursing staff may be ignoring laws which state they must seek approval before restraining care home residents ( picture posed by model )Thousands of elderly and vulnerable patients are being illegally restrained by staff in hospitals and care homes , according to the care watchdog .The Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) warns that carers and nursing staff are ignoring laws which state they must seek approval before depriving patients of their liberty .Figures from the watchdog show that there is a backlog of nearly 20 , 000 cases waiting to be approved and in the meantime staff may well be restraining patients anyway .Under a law introduced in 2009 , staff who want to lock patients in rooms , use sedatives or be otherwise physically forceful must apply for a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard .They commonly are used for dementia patients to prevent them wandering off or hurting themselves .Care home staff go to local councils and hospital employees to the NHS trust but almost half of applications are turned down as they are deemed unnecessary .But the CQC says there has been a such a rise in applications that there is now a worrying backlog awaiting approval .There were nearly 53 , 000 applications in the first six months of 2014 15 , a seven fold rise compared to the numbers submitted for the entire year of 2013 14 .Figures from the watchdog also show that there 19 , 429 applications awaiting approval with local councils and NHS bodies , up from 359 for the same period last year .The CQC is concerned that staff are just using restraining measures anyway illegally while they wait for the paperwork to be completed .David Behan , its chief executive said : ' While we recognise the pressure local authorities are under , this represents a worryingly high number of people being deprived of their liberty without external scrutiny and authorisation . '' It is essential that all professionals looking after people who are unable to give consent deliver best practice in order to protect their rights . 'The huge rise in applications to councils followed two court rulings this year which stated individuals could be deprived of their liberty in foster care and sheltered housing .Initially , staff had assumed the law only applied to hospitals and care homes and particularly dementia patients .George McNamara , Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Alzheimer ' s Society said : ' However the backlog of unresolved requests is unacceptable , with nearly 20 , 000 outstanding applications at the end of September 2014 .Under a law introduced in 2009 , care home staff or hospital workers who want to lock patients in rooms , use sedatives or be otherwise physically forceful must apply for a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard ( file picture )' This raises serious questions and leaves the worrying potential of a person being unlawfully deprived of their liberty simply because the paperwork is yet to be completed .' Depriving anyone of their liberty has to be a last resort , but when necessary it is essential it is closely monitored , legal and always with the best interests of the person in mind . 'In an annual report investigating the use of these orders , the CQC also uncovered harrowing cases of residents being illegally locked up in care homes .One woman with Huntingdon ' s disease a progressive brain condition was kept in a home for more than a year even though her husband had only wanted her to stay for two weeks .Carers had decided it was in her ' best interests ' to remain but delayed applying for a DOLS order for several months .The family appealed via the Court of Protection where a judge ruled her human rights had been breached and awarded her 27 , 000 in compensation .In another example , the CQC said staff at a care home were ' routinely ' being too physically forceful with three patients when washing and dressing them including one who was given a sedative .Staff had not bothered to apply for a safeguard order or even consider whether it was in patients ' best interests . 	 0
Debates seem to be Carly Fiorina s best moments . After the last one , her poll numbers shot up , and the Internet was buzzing with analyses of her strong performance .Among the questions that came up in the wake of the debate was this one : Is Carly Fiorina a feminist ? In a world where to be a feminist seems to signify that you are also a liberal , what does it mean when a conservative professes to be a feminist ? Is it even possible ?Well , here s your answer : Of course it is !Fiorina might not be a feminist if the term is restricted to what LA Times columnist Meghan Daum has called the liberal , abortion rights supporting reusable eco bag toting , dangling earring wearing set . But , then , neither are most Americans . A recent Vox poll is typical : Only 18 percent of Americans identify as feminist .Instead , Fiorina has offered us something better : a model of female power that is free of the whining and pandering that has for so long plagued modern feminism . It s also a model a large number of Americans could embrace , regardless of party or gender ? and one that could give the face of Republican Party politics a much needed makeover . While the media struggles to decide whether Fiorina is or isn t a feminist , it s possible they re missing that her candidacy represents the beginning of a postfeminist era in politics , where what matters is a woman s opportunity , not adherence to specific policies or a platform built on women s issues .This postfeminist approach is by no means anti feminist . Rather , it draws on a model of women s liberation that thrived in the past , lives in the hearts of most Americans and is ripe for resurgence : equity feminism . Equity feminism stands for the moral , social and legal equality of the sexes ? and the freedom of women ( and men ) to employ their equal status to pursue happiness as they define it . It s the feminism of anyone who has said , I m not a feminist , but . Equity feminism does not view men and women as opposing tribes . Theories of patriarchal oppression are not among its founding tablets . Put simply , equity feminism affirms for women what it affirms for everyone : dignity , opportunity and personal liberty .What a refreshing change this would be for the feminist movement . Decades of squabbling over who is and isn t a feminist , ideological policing by activist groups and demands for litmus tests on issues like abortion have created a collective cultural exhaustion around this particular f word . Fiorina captured that divisiveness in one deft sentence : Over the years feminism has devolved into a left leaning political ideology where women are pitted against men and used as a political weapon to win elections . 	 0

tamesha means'water broke early on december 1, 2010. just 18 weeks pregnant, she called a friend for a ride to mercy health partners, the only hospital in muskegon county, michigan. during that visit, and two others the following day, means was in excruciating pain. she was sent home twice given pain medication, told to return if her contractions became unbearable and was waiting to be discharged for a third time when she started to give birth. the baby died less than three hours after it was delivered. that's all according to a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the american civil liberties union last week, which also said that means'fetus had almost no chance of surviving and continuing the pregnancy posed serious risks to her health. health care providers at the hospital knew those facts to be true, the suit alleges, but failed to tell means about the risks and the option of ending her pregnancy because they follow directives from the united states conference of catholic bishops, which don't permit abortion. " as a direct result of these religious directives, ms. means suffered severe, unnecessary, and foreseeable physical and emotional pain and suffering, " reads the lawsuit, which was filed in the u. s. district court for the eastern district of michigan. it accuses the usccb and others of negligence " for promulgating and implementing directives that cause pregnant women who are suffering from a miscarriage to be denied appropriate medical care, including information about their condition and treatment options. " it seeks damages and a declaration that the defendants'actions were negligent.'abortion... is never permitted'at the center of the case is what is known as the ethical and religious directives for catholic health care services a set of guidelines that advises catholic health care providers and patients what to do. specifically, the lawsuit mentions directives no. 27 and no. 45. directive 27 states : " free and informed consent requires that the person or the person's surrogate receive all reasonable information about the essential nature of the proposed treatment and its benefits its risks, side effects, consequences, and cost and any reasonable and morally legitimate alternatives, including no treatment at all. " the termination of a pregnancy would not be considered " morally legitimate, " as outlined in directive 45. " abortion ( that is, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus ) is never permitted, " that directive reads. still, the usccb is not standing by doctors, whispering in their ears, telling them what to do, said robin wilson, a law professor at the university of illinois who focuses on bioethics, health law and religious liberty. " you would have to show some sort of control, or agency, or direct duty in order to reach up to them.... what i read didn't seem to make the linkages that i would have wanted to see, " she said, adding that she thinks the case will be difficult for the aclu to argue. " creative claims win sometimes. it's just conceptually hard to get my mind around it, " wilson said. don clemmer, a spokesman for the united states conference of catholic bishops, declined to comment on the michigan case. a call to mercy health partners was not immediately returned monday.'it's about medical care'means'lawsuit raises issues similar to a recent case in ireland. there, a woman died after being denied an abortion last year. seventeen weeks pregnant, savita halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital complaining of back pain. the doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but refused to do an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband said. days later, halappanavar died from a blood infection, leading lawmakers to call for an investigation into what role abortion laws may have played in her death. " they knew they couldn't help the baby. why did they not look at the bigger life? " her husband, praveen halappanavar, told the irish times. according to the michigan lawsuit, means was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes. at the time she gave birth, she had acute chorioamnionitis and acute funisitis, infections she developed after her membranes ruptured. when left untreated, both can result in infertility and cause other problems, the lawsuit states. it says that means should have been told about her treatment options, including the termination of her pregnancy. she also should have been told about the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy and that even if she decided to go ahead with it, there was virtually no chance the fetus would survive, the lawsuit says. had means known the full extent of her condition, she would have opted to end the pregnancy, according to the lawsuit. the aclu filed the suit to 	 0
NEW YORK In an unprecedented move that has sent shockwaves through the magazine industry , Jane announced plans Monday to publish a special " Sex Issue . "" When the editorial staff got together to plan our next issue , somebody jokingly suggested devoting an entire issue to sex a ' sex issue , ' if you will , " said Jane Pratt , editor in chief of Jane , a monthly magazine geared toward hip 18 to 32 year old women . " After the laughter died down , the room fell silent for almost a minute . It was clear we ' d stumbled onto something . "Founded in 1997 , Jane has featured articles about sex in previous issues . But never before has it or any other magazine published a single issue featuring so many articles on the subject that it could only be called " The Sex Issue . "" The issue will contain all sorts of articles about sex , written by women who ' ve had sex , for women who ' ve had sex , " Pratt said . " No doubt , some people out there will think we ' ve gone too far , but we here at Jane have never been afraid to be provocative and really shake things up . "" This is real , " Pratt continued . " This is what happens between the sheets . Everyone talks about sex behind closed doors . We thought it was time to break down those doors and bring it out into the open . "While the full content of the issue has not been revealed , Pratt mentioned several of the articles that made the final cut . Among them are " What He ' s Really Thinking About Your Body , " " Seven Ways To Make Him Scream , " and " The ' Big O ' : A How To Guide . "" I promise you this is going to be a wild ride , " Pratt said . " One of our reporters is doing a story about the ' ins and outs ' of vibrators , and another is actually reviewing porn . That should really ruffle some feathers within the more conservative quarters of the magazine world . "Added Pratt : " Some of our readers might be a little put off by the idea of an entire ' sex issue ' at first . But if they just give it a chance , I ' m confident they won ' t be able to put it down until their boyfriends get home . "In spite of the enthusiasm among Jane staffers , the decision to publish a sex issue was not an easy one ." Initially , we were afraid our advertisers were going to shy away from this , " advertising director Corinne McHugh said . " It turns out , they were all crazy for the idea . We had to double our page count just to keep up with the ads that came flooding in . "In the wake of the announcement , a number of other publications have announced plans for " sex issues , " including Cosmopolitan , Vogue , FHM , Stuff , Men ' s Health , Esquire , Spin , Entertainment Weekly , Sports Illustrated , Vanity Fair , Harper ' s , Better Homes Gardens , Money , Mother Jones , Comics Buyer ' s Guide , National Geographic , Reason , The Watchtower , Model Railroader , Biblical Archaeology Review , and Cat Fancy ." I don ' t know why we didn ' t think of this sooner , " Pratt said . " It ' s like a license to print money . Sexy money . " 	 1
Intense black smoke billowing from the flames of an oil fire blocks out the sun . A teenage mom with a one day old baby seeks shelter in a dimly lit basement from a barrage of missiles and shells .Incoming fire smashes through the wall of a house being used as an unofficial media center in Homs , the city that is the focus of anti regime protests and Syrian efforts to silence them .For more than a year President Bashar al Assad ' s military had used brutal force to put down the uprising .Across Syria , protesters demanded change chanting " down with the regime " but it was Homs and especially the neighborhood of Baba Amr that became the epicenter .She was joined by Neil Hallsworth , a veteran cameraman who has worked in Iraq , Afghanistan and Israel , and Tim Crockett , a former special forces officer to handle security and who would also become an unofficial stills photographer .Just getting into Homs was an ordeal that took five days for what would normally be a two hour drive .Damon said : " It involves a fairly elaborate process of being moved through farmlands , back roads , trying to avoid the government , ending up in various safe houses . And at every single leg , every single stop , you have a different person who ' s responsible to move you on to the next one , someone who knows the details of the lay of the land around you to ensure that they can actually get you through from one point to another . "In Homs , there was no frontline meaning there was also nowhere that could be called safe .Damon said : " It seems mostly deserted , most of the buildings have sustained some sort of damage . And then you ' ll see a kid peek their head out from a doorway , or you ' ll see a man walking in the street carrying an A . K . "Some of the most constant fire has been on Baba Amr where people are killed or wounded daily , and where two doctors and one of those was a dentist are fighting against the odds to help the casualties .In a makeshift clinic there was a man with head injuries from shrapnel , another whose leg injury was most likely going to lead to an amputation .The medics say the Syrian military regards the clinic as a target so they have set up in numerous temporary houses around Baba Amr , each with patients and with the doctors moving between them .But snipers posted on rooftops above the rubble littered streets made even the shortest of trips treacherous .Mosques put out messages before the bombardment started , telling people to not live on the upper floors , to try to stay away from windows , and to try to find protective rooms , inside their homes .Her daughter Fatimah was the face of innocence amid of Homs . Her father does not know she ' s been born . He left the shelter to get supplies a month ago and has not made it back . And her gran trembled as she explained how two other relatives died .Virtually everyone in the shelter about 300 people had similar horrific stories of violent death .And it was easy to learn how death could come arbitrarily and suddenly in Homs and how survival was as much luck as anything else .Working in a home that had become an unofficial media center for the few Western journalists that have made it into Homs , a rocket slammed into the building just two floors up .Also in Baba Amr was Sunday Times correspondent Marie Colvin who would be killed alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik just a few days later .Throughout Baba Amr , word was spreading that a ground offensive by the Syrian military was imminent .Damon said : " It is fundamentally unfair that we live in a world where we can go film this , report on it , and leave , knowing that the people we ' ve left behind ' s suffering is going to continue . Feeling as if we should ' ve done more , we could ' ve done more . "Hundreds of civilians are believed to have died in the siege of Baba Amr . At least three activists involved in getting video out of Baba Amr have been killed .At the end of February , the Syrian military broke the resistance of Baba Amr . Opposition activists claim the military carried out summary executions .Regime forces continue to bombard other areas that oppose Assad ' s rule . 	 0
riyadh saudi arabia's more or less intelligence chief cook bottle washer, prince roscoe vasco duhgama iii, has said that his totally clueless archaically ineffective kingdom along with, of course, any uncharted territory of nearby unclaimed sand, and or, reasonably unaccounted for stretch of poorly maintained asphalt will make an otherwise " abrupt shift " in already well established contentious relations with the united states as a form of semi meek, yet not entirely unfocused, protest to its commonly perceived display of outright yawn inspiring concern over the syrian war, its unilaterally unfocused overtures ( and undertures, where available ) to not only iran, but suddenly overripe once upon a time teen tart sensation, miley cyrus, as well ( but that's another story ), and, even more importantly, its clearly misguided lingering inability to properly cease and desist will ferrell from making yet another entirely worthless ( with a chance of high concept idiocy ) film that only officially u. n. sanctioned village idiots with an ongoing observable iq of 2. 0 will thoroughly enjoy while either being carefully protected by a properly installed highly absorbent drop cloth, and or, ( in new jersey only ) treated to a well placed direct hit kick in the nuts, a source close to saudi policy ( and, surprisingly enough or maybe not so, once you think about it at least 2 of the 3 most well traveled primary orifices featured on at least one, or more, of the currently available kardashians again, another story ) said on tuesday. prince duhgama iii told 4 out of 5 not yet entirely awake european diplomats no doubt still showing the telltale after effects of their recently completed all night royal palace sponsored jamboree extravagonzo schmooze a thon of hotly contested crazy eights marathons that, for whatever reason, somehow descended dramatically into a seemingly endless series of entirely reckless generic brand cola enema orgies aggressively administered to them by qualified members of the palace kitchen staff, assorted members of the royal family not already well into the better late than never process of finally catching up with season 2 of " the fresh prince of bel air " on netflix, and, oh yeah, some guy from yeman named rudy who was called in during an after hours emergency to unplug the lobby washroom facilities, but wound up sticking around for the balance of the late evening early morning once it was determined that both he and the camel he rode in on were having way too much fun participating in round after round of hedonistic karaoking with an otherwise plentiful supply of underage harlots shipped in from turkey that the u. s. had failed to act effectively, and, on several key occasions, left the toilet seat up, with regards to the syrian crisis and also any ongoing israeli palestinian inability to make nice nice while comparison shopping on e bay for out of town nations to do their bidding, was growing a noticeable governmental erection as far as tehran and vera farmiga were concerned, and, more importantly, had systematically declined to publicly applaud, and or, whistle and hoot accordingly in response to most if not all lackluster saudi support for bahrainonourparade during the certainly less than fun time ( had by none ) when it waylaid a typically hot to trot anti government revolting development in 2011, the source said through an interpreter reportedly not wearing socks or underwear. needless to say, it was not immediately certain if prince duhgama iii's monosyllabic statements to the merry, merry, most contrary had the full support of king abdullah moolaaboolaa, or, better yet, the expressed written consent of major league baseball. " the growing pissed off tested crash burn approved shift away from the u. s. is a really, really, i mean, really, big one, " a source up close and personal but not that way ( at least not all the time ) to saudi policy said. " saudi don't play that way, ya dig? as in, never has, never will. and, for sure, doesn't want to find itself or, for that matter, anyone else in this neck of the no woods no way no how, also otherwise equipped with an unsightly beard, while not wearing pants under the free flowing ceremonial robe of their choice any longer in a situation where it might be perceived to be ( or not to be hold the question ) otherwise dependent on something this intentionally vague, decidedly moronic, or just plain down right silly, if not more so, once it becomes altogether obvious that those assuming a position of regional based power are once again in just enough of a got's to go there odd ball mood to either awkwardly re tell any number of " you know you're a dog romancing infide 	 1
police close streets near the grand place in brussels on sunday, november 22, 2015 ( associated press photo ) brussels :? the search for a key suspect in the paris terror attacks kept the belgian capital in an unprecedented lockdown that brought business to a standstill as european leaders vowed to tackle the crisis at its roots in syria. the clampdown in brussels continued for a third day on monday after a series of raids overnight by counter terrorism special forces failed to find belgium born salah abdeslam, one of two brothers believed to have been involved in attacks that killed 130 in paris on nov. 13. belgium's government warned of a continuing, serious threat to the public. " what we expect is an attack similar to the one that unfolded in paris with multiple people who launch offensives in many places at the same time, " belgian prime minister charles michel said late sunday. the threat is " very serious and imminent. " the belgian capital of around 1. 2 million people was quiet with schools, shops, banks and the metro system closed as european governments prepare to carry out airstrikes against islamic state at its bases in syria. france, where the government extended a state of emergency for three months, put naval forces in position to bomb syria, while the u. k. offered britain's airbase in cyprus for the military operations. " the u. k. will do all in our power to support our friend and ally france to defeat this evil death cult, " prime minister cameron told reporters in paris after meeting with french president francois hollande. " it's absolutely right to take decisive action to stop terrorists. " the decision to keep brussels on a heightened state of alert extended the disruption to the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union, both of which have their headquarters in the city. nato told non essential staff to stay at home, while the eu opened with reinforced security. kbc groep, belgium's biggest bank, closed its headquarters in the capital on monday. " we are working from home and from our disaster recovery dealing room to avoid public places in brussels, " said piet lammens, global head of market research at kbc. " i hope we'll be back in the office tomorrow. we'll evaluate the situation later today. i'm not afraid. " brussels has been on its guard since it emerged that at least three jihadists behind the paris assaults lived in the city. abdeslam, who's now the focus of an international manhunt, comes from the molenbeek district of the capital. counter terrorism officers carried out 22 simultaneous raids in brussels and the belgian city of charleroi, federal prosecutor eric van der sypt told reporters early monday. they detained 16 people, none of whom was abdeslam, and didn't find any explosives or other armaments, he said. the center of brussels was filled with gun toting soldiers, while green army vehicles made their way through snarled traffic outside buildings housing european institutions. security guards stood outside supermarkets, which reopened after closing over the weekend. " bombs, shooting, brussels being the center of the world, it's strange everyone is scared, " said raphael van antwerpen, who runs a cafe in the heart of brussels. " i'm most worried about my daughter, " whose school just outside the capital is open, he said. at the building housing the european commission, the eu's executive arm, police used a mirror on a stick to check under vehicles, while armed soldiers guarded the entrance. finance ministers from the 19 nations using the euro are going ahead with a scheduled meeting in brussels on monday afternoon. " a terror alert or any similar situation makes it all the more pressing on the affected state leaders to be seen to be taking charge, " maltese finance minister edward scicluna said in an email. " the eurogroup finance ministers'meeting is no exception. " after seeing cameron on monday, hollande will meet president barack obama in washington on tuesday and german chancellor angela merkel in paris on wednesday. he'll travel to see russian president vladimir putin in moscow on thursday. cameron said in paris that he'll present a " comprehensive strategy " to the british parliament this week for tackling is in syria. he's seeking approval from lawmakers to join in airstrikes. french defense minister jean yves le drian told europe 1 radio that planes from the aircraft carrier charles de gaulle would be ready to carry out strikes beginning monday. in brussels, store owners are wondering how long these extraordinary measures will continue. michael raynaekers has run a flower shop near the european commission for the last 18 years. his clients are mostly the big offices nearby, and he's worried : these are normally his three busiest weeks. " business will be less than 50 percent today, " he said in his store filled with baubles and other christmas decorations. " people are scared. just look at the 	 0
Niki Taylor knew getting divorced could be a painful experience but nothing prepared her for the heartbreak she endured when her ex husband secretly gave away her beloved pet dog .Niki , 39 , was so distraught at losing Dolly the doberman that she has launched a remarkable nationwide hunt to find her pet .She has already discovered that Dolly was rehomed by a local kennels and is now trying to trace the family who took her in .Bond : Niki Taylor , 39 , and Dolly as a puppy , who was secretly given away by Niki ' s husband after their divorce earlier this year . It was arranged that Simon Taylor would look after the dog until she found a homeThe sad saga began when Niki and Simon Taylor , 43 , went through an acrimonious divorce early this year after seven years of marriage .As part of the settlement , it was agreed Mr Taylor , a corporate headhunter , would look after Dolly for a few months while Niki found somewhere to live . Niki had owned Dolly since she was a puppy .When Niki suffered a knee injury in April , her mother wrote to Mr Taylor asking for the arrangement to be extended .In September , Mr Taylor told his former mother in law that Dolly had ' never been happier ' , but refused permission for Niki to see the dog .Now , Niki has learned that by then her former husband had already given Dolly up to a kennels near his home in Leigh on Sea , Essex , and told them to find the dog a new owner .Niki , who has been staying with friends in West London , was contacted anonymously earlier this month and told her ex had rehomed Dolly without her knowledge .She says that when a mutual friend contacted him , his reply made her fearful for Dolly ' s welfare .She says : ' He told my friend he was not going to tell her what had become of Dolly . He was so vehement , I feared something worse than rehoming . 'The police told Niki they could not help and in desperation she launched a Facebook campaign .' Dolly licked away my tears during a very difficult time in my life and I will never forget her , ' Niki wrote .' It ' s now my turn to make sure she is OK . Please help me find her . 'The appeal struck a chord and within days had been shared more than 40 , 000 times .Niki has launched a nationwide campaign to find Dolly after she discovered she had been given to kennels in Leigh On Sea and rehomed . She is now trying to trace the family that took in her beloved petOne well wisher got in touch last week to help business development manager Niki track down the kennels where Dolly was last seen . However , the kennels refuse to tell her where Dolly has been rehomed .Niki learned her ex husband had signed the dog over to Acres Way Kennels in Benfleet , Essex .She said : ' They told me that Dolly had been given to a family in the area , but because of confidentiality rules , they couldn ' t give me any details .' They assured me that Dolly is in a nice home , but at the very least , I need to know that for myself . 'Simon Taylor ' s solicitor , Rash Mahal , said : ' We had a court order and she was supposed to collect the dog by May 1 .' She didn ' t do it and she didn ' t contact our client , so he had the right to rehouse the dog . Nothing more to say . 'Tom Millson , manager of Acres Way , said the dog was signed over to them in June .' We have behaved responsibly and conducted a visit at the home of the new owner , ' he said .' They are a kind couple who have looked after Dolly , but they don ' t feel comfortable coming forward .

Crossroads , South Carolina Despite their endless bickering , the Republican presidential candidates all agree that they would like to take the nation back to a more gentler and prosperous era . But they have very different views on what point in American ' s history they should aim for .Front runner Mitt Romney , whose key political action committee is called Restore Our Future , seems to be targeting the early 80s , judging from both his policy statements and his haircut ." We were out of Vietnam , " he said . " The Berlin wall was tumbling down . There was no Internet making fun of the candidates and holding them accountable for every word they said . Plus , you could fire whoever you wanted , without explaining why the bastards deserved to be let go . "Newt Gingrich seems to focus on the post World War II era of the 1950s . " As America ' s foremost historian , I can tell you without reservation that the United States ruled the world in those days ." To get back to them , we need to reestablish the nation ' s social hierarchy . Our leaders come first , then the American working man . And women and children last .

One constant about the Golden Globes ( tonight at 8 on WHDH , Ch . 7 , with returning host Ricky Gervais ) , besides the sometimes alcohol induced gaiety as the live telecast continues into its third and final hour , is the presence of a new Miss Golden Globe .In a tradition that began 53 years ago when there were two 1963 Miss Golden Globes ? one for TV ( Beverly Hillbillies starlet Donna Douglas ) and the other for movies ( the now forgotten Eva Six ) ? the Miss Golden Globe ( rarely is there a Mr Golden Globe ) will smile as she gracefully escorts the winners offstage and serves as handy backup in case anyone falls or faints .The role , while hardly demanding , is open only to those with a distinct showbiz pedigree .This year s Miss Golden Globe is Corinne Foxx , daughter of Jamie Foxx . Corinne is a USC senior and model .No one from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , which sponsors the Globes , would talk about how the honorees are chosen , but it s clear that an unknown from Utah wouldn t have a ghost of a chance .? Linda Evans , who was in her Big Valley cowgirl era when she took part in the 1964 Globes .? Melanie Griffith , daughter of The Birds star Tippi Hedren , actually co starred in three significant films in 1975 ( the beauty pageant satire Smile , the quirky thriller Night Moves , with Gene Hackman , and opposite Paul Newman in The Drowning Pool ) when she was paged for awards duty .? Dakota Johnson , Griffith s daughter with Don Johnson , continued the family tradition in 2006 , well before her breakthrough in Fifty Shades of Grey .Other famous offspring who can lay claim to the title : Laura Dern ( 1982 ) , whose parents are Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd Rumer Willis ( 2009 ) , the Dancing With the Stars daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis and Joely Fisher ( 1992 ) , daughter of Eddie Fisher ( and thus half sister to Star Wars vet Carrie Fisher ) and Connie Stevens .Among the few men are Sam Fox ( 2013 ) , son of Michael J . Fox and Tracy Pollan , and John Clark Gable ( 1995 ) , the only son of the Hollywood legend and Gone With the Wind star . He was born in 1961 , months after his father s death .

Novelty shit always seems to sell well , " said Elaine Maier , head apparel buyer for an area Marshall Field ' s department store . " Then again , around this time of year , people will buy just about any shit they can get their hands on . "Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg , IL , is getting into the spirit of the holidays and of selling loads of shit by decorating its courtyard in a " Wonderland of Shit " motif featuring Christmas themed shit from all 172 of its stores .

Toys ' R ' Us , the nation ' s largest toy retailer , is aggressively promoting its seasonal slogan , " The shit you want at the best prices . "" Not only is there more shit this year than ever before , " said noted economist Milton Friedenzohn , " but what there is is far shittier .

Buenos Aires The scandal enmeshing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner already had a plot as twisted as a Machiavelli novel .But this week , it contorted again , when the country ' s former spy chief disappeared .Horacio Antonio Stiuso was supposed to testify Thursday about the mysterious death of a special prosecutor , who had leveled scathing accusations at Fernandez .Authorities have not been able to find the ex director of the Secretary of Intelligence , let alone notify him that he has been called to testify .The intrigue surrounding him , the dead prosecutor and the President dates back to 1994 when a car bomb demolished a Jewish center in Buenos Aires , killing 85 people .Special prosecutor Alberto Nisman implicated Iran in the attack , in his nearly 300 page investigation report . Then he accused Fernandez of covering up Tehran ' s involvement to sweeten a trade deal .Cash strapped Argentina would allegedly get Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain .Shortly after filing his report and one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations in January , Nisman was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head .In his trash can , investigators found a draft warrant for Fernandez ' s arrest .The President was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later . A test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman ' s hands , as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger .Fernandez ' s government blamed the intelligence agency for his death , and the President filed a bill for the agency to be dissolved and replaced by the new Federal Intelligence Agency .The Senate took up debate on the bill on Wednesday . Supporters hope to have it on Fernadez ' s desk to sign by February 25 .And she pointed the finger at Stiuso , accusing him of feeding Nisman false information and having a hand in his death . Stiuso was using Nisman to discredit her for firing Stiuso last year , she claimed .But Stiuso ' s replacement , Oscar Parrilli , reeled him back in not as an agent , but as a witness . On Thursday , the director said Fernandez would relieve Stiuso of his pledge of secrecy ." The President of the nation has given us the directive and now we are going to work on preparing the authorization to relieve Mr Stiuso of the obligation to keep secrets , " Parrilli said .Though now allowed to testify , Stiuso can ' t been found .Watch Anderson Cooper 360 weeknights 8pm ET .

Police authorities believe that a crime lord from Sinaloa , Mexico is behind the dumping of four bodies alongside a deserted parkway at a beach on New York ' s Long Island ." We have evidence that points to the fact that a serial killer is being used by the drug cartel to prevent authorities from interfering with drug trafficking in the New York area . If we interfere in their drug trafficking they will kill innocent women once more and it ' s no different from a hostage situation because all the women in New York City are the hostages , " Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dammer told reporters .The identity of the bodies are not known , but authorities are warning women in New York to be careful because drug dealers associated with a cartel in Mexico plan on killing more innocent women if their business dealings are hindered by police investigations .Police officials said on Monday that they plan on halting all drug investigations in New York City to allow drug dealers from Mexico an opportunity to run their drug trafficking without being bothered by the police , in an attempt by the police to save the lives of more innocent women .The bodies were found in the same manner as bodies found in Mexico and police believe a Mexican hit man , using the same method of operation that he used in Mexico , may be working in the area . These type of hit men are under contract and they are highly paid professionals .The bodies appear to have been there for at least two months , according to the Suffolk County Police Department official .At Oak Beach there were three bodies found and a fourth was discovered near the same area . This is the typical scatter pattern that Mexican hit men use in Mexico to increase fear in the public by creating the believe that the killer is in different areas hunting for victims . 	 1
minneapolis area stoner mike cudahy, his eyes a deep red from five years of near continuous recreational marijuana use, regaled friends and neighbors tuesday with half remembered tales of this one amazing bong he saw in iowa city once. the bong, described in reverent, half whispered tones by cudahy as " awesome, " " incredible " and " seriously mind blowing, " was allegedly seen during a weekend stay at his friend's cousin's place in iowa city this one time, probably sometime between 1993 and 1995. according to cudahy, the " super bong, " composed of an intricate network of plastic tubing, a motor from a lawn mower, several five gallon buckets of ice water and a fully functional antique pool table, was " so unbelievable, i couldn't hardly believe what i was lookin'at. " " i was like, shit, " cudahy said. according to cudahy, whose account has not been verified as of press time, the iowa city bong is " the most amazingly killer bong in the whole world " and may, in fact, be " the greatest bong of all time. " cudahy's tale was recounted before an estimated living room audience of six during a late night discussion of the topic, " what was the most amazing bong you ever saw? " the mythic retelling, which interrupted the viewing of a videotaped mystery science theater 3000 episode that " nobody was really paying all that much attention to " because " they'd already seen it, like, 50 times, " was described by those present as " awe inspiring. " " you call that a bong? " cudahy said to his roommate, pizza delivery driver greg reuthven, moments after reuthven had finished his " most amazing bong i've ever seen " story. " that's a perfectly good bong, don't get me wrong, but if you want to hear about a bong, i'll tell you about a bong. " added cudahy, " i'll tell you about a bong, man. " witnesses said cudahy then launched into his tale of the super bong sighting. the emotionally charged account lasted approximately 45 minutes, interrupted only once by a 20 minute break during which the assembled stoners unsuccessfully attempted to get enough cash together for some chinese take out before realizing that hunan palace had been closed for several hours. embellishing his tale with dramatic hand gestures, wide eyed expressions of childlike wonderment, and occasional stretches of silence when he lost track of what he was talking about, cudahy recounted how he and this one guy had traveled to iowa city to help this other guy move. he and the first guy, cudahy explained, had encountered " major hassles " when their van broke down halfway through hauling the second guy's shit. hoping to borrow another van from these dudes the one guy knew from work or something, they went over to this one apartment " above a liquor store. " it was there, cudahy said, that he encountered the incomprehensible bong. " i've seen some amazing shit in my day, but that one took the freakin'cake, that's for sure, " cudahy said. " i guess, supposedly, it originally belonged to this one engineering student or something, but whoever invented that shit, man, he's probably working for, like, nasa right now, because that guy is some kind of mother scientific genius. " continued cudahy, " they cranked up this motor that sort of sucked in air through a bunch of what do you call pneumatic chambers or something, and filtered the smoke into, like, all these ice buckets. it totally had built in heating coils pumping steam into the chamber for the smoothest, most concentrated, high thc hits possible. and there were like eight or nine hookah tubes coming out the top, so a whole roomful of dudes could get high off that shit at the same time. " " plus, as if that weren't enough, " cudahy added, " you could shoot pool on it. " " whoa, " several present in the room reportedly responded. cudahy said he wound up staying at the apartment for, like, eight or nine hours or something, and after that, he can't even freakin'remember. cudahy's epic account is considered the most spectacular bong story in recent memory, eclipsing such legendary stoner anecdotes as the " 10 gallon gravity bong " tale of miami's juan hermosa, and the story of the time austin, tx, stoner greg klesko saw this one bamboo 15 footer some dude supposedly brought back from vietnam like 30 years ago 	 1
WASHINGTON More than a week after President Barack Obama ' s cold blooded killing of a local couple , members of the American news media admitted Tuesday that they were still trying to find the best angle for covering the gruesome crime ." I know there ' s a story in there somewhere , " said Newsweek editor Jon Meacham , referring to Obama ' s home invasion and execution style slaying of Jeff and Sue Finowicz on Apr . 8 . " Right now though , it ' s probably best to just sit back and wait for more information to come in . After all , the only thing we know for sure is that our president senselessly murdered two unsuspecting Americans without emotion or hesitation . "Added Meacham , " It ' s not so cut and dried . "Since the killings took place , reporters across the country have struggled to come up with an appropriate take on the ruthless crime , with some wondering whether it warrants front page coverage , and others questioning its relevance in a fast changing media landscape ." What exactly is the news hook here ? " asked Rick Kaplan , executive producer of the CBS Evening News . " Is this an upbeat human interest story about a ' day in the life ' of a bloodthirsty president who likes to kill people ? Or is it more of an examination of how Obama ' s unusual upbringing in Hawaii helped to shape the way he would one day viciously butcher two helpless citizens in their own home ? "" Or maybe the story is just that murder is cool now , " Kaplan continued . " I don ' t know . There are a million different angles on this one . "So far , the president ' s double homicide has not been covered by any major news outlets . The only two mentions of the heinous tragedy have been a 100 word blurb on the Associated Press wire and an obituary on page E7 of this week ' s edition of the Lake County Examiner .While Obama has expressed no remorse for the grisly murders point blank shootings with an unregistered . 38 caliber revolver many journalists said it would be irresponsible for the press to sensationalize the story ." There ' s been some debate around the office about whether we should report on this at all , " Washington Post senior reporter Bill Tracy said while on assignment at a local dog show . " It ' s enough of a tragedy without the press jumping in and pointing fingers or , worse , exploiting the violence . Plus , we need to be sensitive to the victims ' families at this time . Their loved ones were brutally , brutally murdered , after all . "Nevertheless , a small contingent of independent journalists has begun to express its disapproval and growing shock over the president ' s actions ." I hate to rain on everyone ' s parade , but we are in the midst of an economic crisis here , " political pundit Marcus Reid said . " Why was our president ritualistically dismembering the corpses of his prey when he should have been working on a new tax proposal for small businesses ? I , for one , am outraged . "The New York Times newsroom is reportedly still undecided on whether or not to print a recent letter received from Obama , in which the president threatens to kill another helpless citizen every Tuesday and " fill his heavenly palace with slaves for the afterlife " unless the police " stop the darkness from screaming . "" President Obama ' s letter presents us with a classic journalistic quandary , " executive editor Bill Keller said . " If we print it , then we ' re giving him control over the kinds of stories we choose to run . It would be an acknowledgment that we somehow give the nation ' s commander in chief special treatment . "Added Keller , " And that ' s just not how the press in this country works . " 	 1
With Iran ' s president in New York for the UN General Assembly , an Iranian American family in Michigan is appealing to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly to have their son imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges released before his father dies of brain cancer ." Please , please , please release an innocent man , " pleaded the father , Ali Hekmati , who had a cancerous tumor removed from his brain . " Reunite him with his father , his mother . "Ali Hekmati ' s doctor says the cancer is incurable and that he has just months to live . He will undergo radiation treatment and chemotherapy in hopes of extending his life long enough embrace his son one last time .Family pleads for son ' s release" That ' s my biggest fear , that he may not see me and that ' s my last wish , to hug him and kiss him before I pass to the other side , " Ali Hekmati said .Amir Hekmati , a former marine and decorated Iraq war veteran , was born in Arizona and raised in Nebraska and Michigan . Within weeks of setting foot in Iran for the first time in August 2011 to visit his grandmother , he was arrested , interrogated , imprisoned .Months later he appeared on Iranian TV , showcased as a confessed CIA operative ." They forced him to do that . That ' s not true , " said Hekmati ' s mother , Behnaz , referring to the alleged confession ." They knew he was a military ( soldier ) because he told the Embassy of Iran he was in the military , " she adds , explaining that her son checked with Iranian authorities in the United States before making the trip .The U . S . State Department also denies Hekmati was spying for the U . S . government and calls the case a gross miscarriage of justice ." We never thought he should have been arrested . We ' ve been trying , because he ' s a dual U . S . Iranian national , we ' ve been trying to get access to him since he was originally locked up , " said State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland . " The Iranians have never allowed us to go to see him . "Mother of accused U . S . spy says Iranian charges are falseA court convicted Hekmati of espionage , sentencing him to death , but he has since been granted a retrial .He remains in prison in Iran and has no idea that his father is dying , his family said . He has a government approved lawyer in Iran , but contact with him has been sporadic .His father ' s neurosurgeon , Dr Ryan Barrett , believes the emotional stress of his son ' s imprisonment will make cancer treatment more challenging .Although the Iranian president has thus far declined to meet with the Hekmatis or discuss Amir ' s case , the former marine ' s mother is convinced Ahmadinejad will hear their pleas ." I ' m sure that he ' s going to hear my voice . He ' s in the United States he ' s going to listen to me , " said Amir ' s mother . " I just want him to hear my voice as a mother . "She has traveled to Iran three times and been granted limited visits . She described her son as disheartened and completely confused as to why he was arrested ." He is skinny , pale , like a chalk , his face was like chalk . Hair was shaved , had a beard , he walked like this and the feet was together he walked like a robot , " she said .

charlotte, nc the first family has turned more than a few heads at this week's democratic national convention, where the president, as he greets delegates and waves to crowds of supporters, is often accompanied not only by his wife and two daughters, but also his rarely seen 19 year old son, luther. the shy, slightly overweight teenager, who has lived his entire life with his mother in central illinois, seldom appears in public with the president, with whom he has reportedly shared a somewhat distant and occasionally strained relationship. " when i saw that kid with president obama, i had no clue who he was, " said georgia delegate kathy tyson, stating that the teen appeared to have difficulty sustaining eye contact with others and stood uncomfortably alongside his father when he shook hands with voters thursday. " i guess he does kind of look like the president, though a bit shorter and stockier. " luther was born in 1993 to andrea pletcher, then a 24 year old diner cashier whom obama, a young law professor at the time, met during a brief trip to the state capital of springfield. while the president's son is said to have faced numerous obstacles during his childhood, including academic troubles, repeated emotional outbursts, and his mother's bouts with alcoholism, family friends have stated that overall he was a " good kid " who " genuinely meant well. " white house aides said the president sends money to pletcher each month for luther's care. after he became a u. s. senator and moved to washington, obama reportedly visited his 11 year old son every other saturday afternoon, playing wiffle ball with him or taking him out to a movie matinee and then dinner at the local applebee's. when he became president, however, obama's contact with the boy reduced markedly, though sources confirmed he would still send luther a birthday card and speak with him on the phone every month or so, often talking him through his schoolwork or asking about his son's interests in music and online gaming. according to reports, the two have often struggled to find common ground, owing largely to their sharply differing levels of motivation and expectations for academic and personal success. " there was a rough patch during luther's early and mid teens when he and his dad didn't get along at all, " said pletcher, speaking from the 600 a month ground level condominium she shares with her son and live in boyfriend. " but barry came to luther's high school graduation last year, and that was a big step forward for them. and now that luther's rebellious phase seems to be winding down, there's definitely a greater respect between them. " " i'll tell you, though, luther was a real handful for a while there, with his add and all, " pletcher continued. " but he's doing okay now. and i've been with boyfriend ian williams for the past three years, so luther's had a male figure he can look up to a little bit. " in a sign of their improving relationship, obama is said to have congratulated his son heartily upon learning luther was giving school another shot this fall, enrolling part time at lincoln land community college. additionally, obama expressed optimism that his son could have a " real bright future " in the field of sales or, if he applied himself, computers. with luther now slated to join the first family on the campaign trail, staffers confirmed the president has encouraged them to entrust the frequently expressionless teen, who often dresses in all black clothing, with some minor tasks to help him learn about responsibility. " we've got luther stuffing envelopes and handing out pins to the delegates, and he's doing a great job, " senior campaign aide stephanie cutter said. " it takes a while for him to come out of his shell, but once he opens up he's a real nice kid. plus he's just so great with sasha and malia. they really love their half brother. " " luther may not have his father's smarts or gift for rhetoric, " cutter added, " but he tries. and he's got a good heart a real good heart. " despite comments that interactions between the president and his son have remained noticeably stiff and awkward, obama said he was excited that he and luther were spending quality time together and " finally starting to get to know each other. " " i can't say i was the perfect father by any means, " said obama, admitting candidly that he " wasn't always there for luther. " " while my son has battled his share of problems, his mother really did the best she could raising him, and i think she did a fine job. now luther and i are ready to move forward and make up for lost time. " " i'm real proud of my boy, " he added, putting his 	 1
human brains might have a 3d gps system which allows us to navigate around unfamiliar surroundings, scientists have claimed. they say we may possess cells that enable us to keep track of our direction, which can become disorientated when we come out of a subway station, for example. and further understanding of the system could help us deal with effects such as vertigo. a study by researchers from the weizmann institute of science in israel found that mammals have head direction cells that work like a 3d compass system. researchers believe that humans might posses similar type of orientation cells. the findings could help pilots cope with the effects of vertigo ( stock image shown ) the study, led by graduate student arseny finkelstein at the weizmann institute of science in rehovot, israel and published in nature, looked at cells in the brains of bats. earlier work by dr nachum ulanovsky of the same institution had showed that bats possessed'place'and'grid'cells that work like a gps system to keep track of their position. that is similar to what is found in rodents, suggesting humans, too, also had the ability to map their position in 3d space.'we think that this work can be relevant to other mammals, including humans,'mr finkelstein told mailonline.'there is some evidence the human mind might have a similar system, but the exact mechanism of is still unknown. earlier this year a study suggested that bees rely on a built in'sat nav'system to find their way around. honeybees were found to make'mental maps'of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives. while humans, sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique, it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun's position to find their way back to their hive. dr james cheeseman of auckland university in new zealand, said :'only 50 years ago the claim any non human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind. the question of whether insects do is a frontier question.'' our research is the first in mammalian species that identifies this 3d system in the brain.'the study of a bat brain shed light on how mammals orient themselves in complex environments by relying on neurons that work in three dimensions. this system acts as an internal compass that gives animals including humans a continuous sense of direction and location as they move around. they found certain cells respond to the bats'horizontal and vertical orientation and these so called head direction cells track direction in three dimensions as the bats manoeuvre. these cells create a doughnut shaped, 3d neural compass that gives a precise orientation and even enables the bat to know if it is upside down or upright. similarly, in humans, pilots are trained to guard against a sudden loss of vertical direction vertigo that renders them unable to tell'up'from'down'and sometimes even leads to crashes. coming up out of an underground station can produce similar confusion for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction. in both cases the disorientation is believed to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3d compass.'in order to start understanding brain mechanisms for 3d orientation, we need to start by identifying the basic building blocks,'mr finkelstein added. in humans coming up out of an underground station can produce navigational confusion for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction ( stock image shown ). it is thought to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3d compass. the researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed to support navigation in 3d space. much research has been conducted on place and grid cells whose discoverers were awarded the 2014 nobel prize in physiology or medicine. but until recently head direction cells have been studied only in 2d settings in rats. the researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed. shown is an egyptian fruit batso the researchers developed a tracking apparatus that allowed them to video monitor all the three angles of head rotation in flight terminology, yaw, pitch and roll and to observe the movements of freely behaving egyptian fruit bats. at the same time the bats'neuronal activity was monitored via implanted micro electrodes which revealed, in a specific sub region of the hippocampal formation, cells are tuned to a particular 3d angle of the head. certain neurons became activated only when the animal's head was pointed at that 3d angle. the study also revealed for the first time how the brain computes a sense of the vertical direction integrating it with the horizontal. in the brain compass these directions are computed separately at different levels of complexity some operating in 2d and others in 3d. the researchers believe the 2d head direction cells could 	 0
OAHU , HI Sources deep within Hawaiian Punch ' s secret military compound near Oahu revealed Monday that the fruit juice superpower has developed a devastating new weapon in the fight against thirst : the Very Berry Bomb , a 500 megaton , Fruitonium powered device capable of refreshing a city the size of Houston ." If the device actually works , " said Frederick Buttle , Harvard University professor of political science , " it could decisively shift the Thirst War balance of power in favor of the Hawaiians . "Test detonations in the Nevada desert have demonstrated the bomb ' s awesome power . Bright red mushroom clouds reaching heights of up to 1 , 500 feet have erupted on military testing grounds throughout the state , showering tropical berry excitement throughout the hot , arid region .Troops exposed to the bomb ' s fallout reportedly emerged from clouds of dust in a festive mood , wearing flowered shirts and leis , and in some cases having formed conga lines ." Clearly , any area struck by this bomb would not return to normal for decades , " Buttle said . " We are likely talking about a non stop luau , day and night , for generations to come . "Added Buttle : " To be shielded from the super fruity effects of the bomb , you would need a shelter with five foot thick , steel walls , ideally buried some 20 feet underground , and even then residual tropicality would seep into the surrounding soil and contaminate you upon exiting . "" The secret to the bomb ' s intense fruity taste is the countless varieties of berries used , " explained Heinrich Wolfe , a well known expert on fruit flavored beverages . " Strawberries , raspberries , and blueberries . Boysenberries , loganberries , blackberries and even huckleberries . "In addition to the awesomely fruit a rooty taste concentrated into each bomb , the use of 10 percent fruit juice guarantees an overwhelming taste sensation for the population upon which the bomb is dropped ." Kool Aid , with its zero percent real fruit juice , can not even dream of competing with Hawaiian Punch now , " Wolfe said . " Hawaiian Punch ' s enemies must kneel before Punchy or be quenched with one mighty blow . ' Come on and go Hawaiian ' is no longer a mere suggestion it is a genuine threat . "The announcement of the new Hawaiian Punch bomb has sent Kool Aid military leaders , with their badly outdated arsenal of Rock a dile Red Missiles , scrambling to develop new weapons technologies . Among the plans for the once dominant beverage power : a 100 million Tropical Tango Missile , described by one top Pentagon official as " MX Mango riffic . "Despite its awesome power , one technical disadvantage to the bomb revolves around the difficulty in getting a hostile nation to say it would like a nice Hawaiian Punch , a necessity before the bomb can be dropped ." Punchy , " Hawaiian Punch ' s Thirst Quencher in Chief , has reportedly been trying to get Kool Aid leaders to say it for weeks . Kool Aid leaders , however , have steadfastly refused to do so , threatening to summon their dreaded anthropomorphic pitcher if pressure does not relent .Manufactured in 48 ounce cans , the bomb is also expected to be produced in a handy eight ounce lunch box size for use in precision refreshing of smaller areas . 	 1
Al Qaeda warns Saudi Arabia it will pay for executing militantsAl Qaeda linked Nusra Front fighters carry their weapons on the back of a pick up truck during the release of Lebanese soldiers and policemen in Arsal , eastern Bekaa Valley , Lebanon , December 1 , 2015 .DUBAI Al Qaeda has warned Saudi Arabia it will pay for the executions of dozens of its members , saying they were intended to be a new year ' s gift to Riyadh ' s Western allies aimed at consolidating the rule of the Saud dynasty .Though it was the killing of a Shi ite cleric in the January 2 mass execution which sparked a crisis between Saudi Arabia and its regional rival Iran , most of the 47 executed were al Qaeda militants convicted of bombings and gun attacks in the kingdom .In a statement dated January 10 , al Qaeda ' s Yemeni branch and its North African wing said Riyadh had gone ahead with the executions despite a warning not to do so ." But they ( Riyadh ) insisted on offering the blood of the good Mujahideen as a sacrifice for the Crusaders on their holiday , in the New Year , " the two groups said in the statement posted on social media ." Let them wait for the day when God will heal the chests of the families of the martyrs , their brothers and those who love them from the arrogant infidel , " it added .Al Qaeda ' s Yemen branch threatened in December to " shed the blood of the soldiers of Al Saud " if its members were executed .Last week , Islamic State , a Sunni rival of al Qaeda , threatened to destroy Saudi Arabian prisons holding jihadists after the executions .Both organisations are fighting against Saudi Arabia , which has declared them terrorist groups and locked up thousands of their supporters .Though it was the executions of Nimr al Nimr , a prominent Shi ite cleric and three other Shi ' ite Muslims , which drove up sectarian tension with Shi ite power Iran , analysts say they were meant mostly to send a signal to militant Sunnis .These analysts suggest Saudi Arabia was aiming to crush support for Sunni jihadists active in the kingdom without alienating more moderate Sunnis .Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings and shootings in Saudi Arabia since November 2014 that have killed more than 50 people , most of them Shi ' ites but also more than 15 members of the security forces .( Reporting by Mostafa Hashem , writing by Sami Aboudi , Editing by Richard Balmforth ) 	 0
omaha one hour before attending a party, sarah gibson, 34, asked her husband mark, 33, a scientist of astronomy, if he thought the pants she was wearing made her look fat. " now be honest, " she said. " i really need to know if these pants make me look fat. " " i'd been caught in this trap before, " husband, mark gibson told reporters. " if i said'no, they don't, honey,'then she would call me a liar. if i said,'i'm sorry dear, but they do,'then i would be instantly killed. so, like any sane husband, i tried to find neutral ground. " reportedly, mark turned to his wife and said, " you have nothing to worry about, sweetie. your fat makes those pants look real skinny. so skinny, they look like they're ten years younger. " " i don't remember much after that, " mark stated. " i think i saw her move. then everything just went black. when i came back to consciousness, the jeans were tied around my neck in a noose. sarah was nowhere in sight. " sarah gibson could not be reached for comment. her mother, however, had lots to say. " that jerk! " said sarah's mother, clair wilson, 65. " he's just like every other guy. you ask a simple question and they either clam up, or make some smart mouthed remark they think won't get them in trouble. when will these idiots learn? if a woman asks if she looks fat in something, don't tell her she doesn't because she knows she does and just wants you to say she doesn't so she can accuse you of really thinking she does when she knows that you think she does and you're a stinkin'liar when you say she doesn't! " mrs wilson then turned to her husband, " am i right, harold? " harold twitched in his body cast, and stuck his tongue out twice, meaning " yes, dear. " omaha psychologist david mathers phd, has accumulated a list of 543 other questions that seem to entrap stupid men. " aside from the'do i look fat in these?'question, " stated mathers, " there are other no win questions, or statements that entrap the male. " mathers calls his collection the " she wins every time list ". a few are as follows : 1 ) " should i bleach my hair? " if you say yes, then your partner will accuse you of fantasizing about blonde women. if you say no, she will accuse you of trying to hold her down and keep her in " your special mold ". if you say, " do whatever you want, dear. " then she will say you don't care and therefore, don't love her. once you reach this point, you may as well slit your own throat. 2 ) if she says : " if you want to see the movie with the rock, that's fine by me. " don't fall for this one! what she is actually saying is, " fine, you selfish jerk! let's go see your stupid tough guy blood and guts flick! if you really loved me you would take me to see the movie sexy man cuddles with average woman because he see's the inner beauty no one else seems to notice. 3 ) if she asks : " do you love me? " this is the mother beast of all questions. a simple " yes " or " no " will not do since both words are short and women attribute the depth of your answer to the depth of your love. don't say, " i have married you, didn't i? " or, " of course i love you, you dumb broad! " these will only cause you pain. as for mark gibson, his comment went unappreciated. " i thought my comment was more of a compliment, " mark says. " i didn't call her fat, and i didn't lie. i thought for sure i had the right answer. " sitting up in his bed in the icu at university hospital, he continued, " i'm supposed to win the nobel peace prize for finding the formula that makes up the conundrum soft surface of black hole altered dimensions in universal alternate reality basis of the sixth cubical light factor. but i can't even find the right answer to the most common question in the known universe : " do those pants make my wife look fat? " shaking his head, and breathing deeply from the oxygen hose in his nostrils, mark added, " i think the only answer to that is,'no yes, honey. those pants certainly don't yes make you look no fat in those jeans no they don't yes.

Authorities in the Thai capital of Bangkok have today said that an ancient soap dispenser has been discovered in the toilets at a school in the city , prompting fears that , at one time , soap may have been used to wash children ' s hands after they had visited the toilet .The school , which cannot be named because I would get the sack , has denied all rumours that the item found is a soap dispenser , and claims that soap has never been , isn ' t , and never will be used at the school to avoid cross infection of virulent diseases .Our reporter got inside the school this morning , and visited the toilets in question . He managed to get this report out before communications were severed :" The bog floors are awash with water most of it steaming piss . Children run splashing through this stinking lake without shoes , meaning that their socks if they wear any are sodden with urine , and will reek all day . The cubicles are no better . Turds , days old , bob about in the small amount of water that there is in the bowls , have decomposed , and have dissipated a messy brown cloud from which the porcelain will never recover . On emerging from the stalls , children are faced with taps that either don ' t work , or wildly spurt out water . Soap is nowhere to be found . "A caretaker at the school , who looks about 150 , but is probably only about 45 , told our hack :" I remember soap . It was white , with bits in it like tiny , tiny stones . It came in bars , but none of the kids used it . They were in too much of a hurry to get back to their game of football to wash the piss and shit from under their fingernails ! Bless ' em ! "Asked if he thought the school ' s lackadaisical approach to handwashing might pose a threat from cholera or typhoid , he shrugged his shoulders and laughed :" What ' s cholera or typhoid ? " 	 1
With modern cars , such as the iKia , coming with iPhone docks integrating the iPhone into the car ' s music and navigation systems , drivers with kids are faced with a stark reality : either select all of the songs that are ' safe ' for kids to listen to and put them in their own play list , not play music in the car , or accept that occasionally , their kids will hear profanity in the music ." A lot of modern music has swear words in , " said App World ! editor , Mac Buck . " I don ' t have any kids , but I ' d imagine that having them singing along to Lily Allen , P ! nk or My Chemical Romance is going to cause friction in the car . "With play lists taking an age to construct , and not having music in the car a complete non starter , AppIT , a British App company from Milton Keynes has finally come up with the solution : Censor Sensor ." At it ' s heart , " said Buck , " is a pretty good music player , with all the standard facilities aficionados have come to expect . Shuffle , album art , easy downloads , remote control , all easily accessible . The buttons are bright and clear and intuitive . "Where Censor Sensor differs from other music players is that it listens to the next bit of the song before you do ." If you turn on the censor function , " said Buck , " it will insert ' bleep ' into the song when it detects a profanity . "According to Buck , the applelet works pretty well , and no profanity gets through ." I think they ' ve erred on the side of caution , " he said . " Whilst no profanity gets through , when I played a James Blunt song through the app , it bleeped the entire album . Either it doesn ' t understand his accent , or the app has taste . " 	 1
topics : marco rubio, 2016 elections, 2016 debates, jeb bush, john harwood, tax cuts, aol on, elections news, news, politics newsheading into the third republican debate last night, the conventional wisdom among the press and political professionals seemed to have coalesced around the idea that donald trump, ben carson, ted cruz and marco rubio are the strongest four contenders in the race at the moment. though that may be only because general jack d. ripper has yet to declare his candidacy. trump and carson have shown themselves to be nuttier than a planters factory and cruz is still hated by pretty much everyone in the gop outside of his hardcore supporters. which left marco rubio in need of a good performance to settle some nervous stomachs, despite the fact he comes off as someone who went out to ask his neighbors to vote for him to head the neighborhood watch and accidentally wandered into a presidential campaign instead. rubio is a very smooth liar as long as he s reciting his memorized lines, so he came off well when jeb! bush went after him over his senate absenteeism, an attack he had clearly prepared for. but there was another moment, first flagged by jonathan chait, which has conservatives up in arms. it came when john harwood, the cnbc debate moderator, questioned rubio about his tax plan and is worth examining to see an example of rubio s mendacity, and how he turned it into a triumphant moment that had the right wing s flying monkeys howling in support. harwood : the tax foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale. since you re the champion of americans living paycheck to paycheck, don t you have that backward? rubio : no, that s? you re wrong. in fact, the largest after tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. and there s a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them. harwood : senator, the tax foundation said after tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27. 9 percent. harwood : and people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent. rubio : yeah, but that? because the math is, if you? 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. so yeah, someone who makes more money, numerically, it s gonna be higher. but the greatest gains, percentage wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan. right wing partisans were quick to dig up this harwood tweet from a couple of weeks ago that supports rubio s point about the lower end of the income spectrum, which is supposed to be proof that harwood knowingly misrepresented the plan even though he had just been corrected on this same issue two weeks ago. except harwood s question was not about the lower end of the tax spectrum. he asked about the 15 tax increase the middle class? which is the vast majority of taxpayers? would see. the plan s effect on the lower end of the scale is not in dispute. here is the video. it seems clear rubio is not prepared to talk about the enormous tax cut his plan gives the wealthiest one percent while dumping a significant increase on the middle class, so he defaults to telling the poor how much he will help them instead. if he had been wearing a fez and had a wind up key sticking out of his back, i would not have been surprised. it s too bad harwood didn t follow up by asking about reports that rubio s plan, which also cuts the tax rate for businesses to 25 percent, would also blow an enormous hole in the deficit that conservatives are so concerned about when it s politically convenient. that could have been fun. there has long been a certain desire among journalists and politicians to make marco rubio happen. he s young and telegenic and has the sort of humble roots that narrative writers and image consultants slobber over. if he wins the nomination, his opponent in the general will be either bernie sanders or ( much more likely, sorry, bernie fans ) hillary clinton. either one gives the media the youth vs. decrepit old story it loves so much, as it can easily be inflated into a larger question of the country s direction, i. e. can rubio s youthful energy shake up the official, stodgy old washington represented by hillary clinton and the democrats, etc. etc. it also requires that voters and the media ignore how retrograde and outmoded many of rubio s policies are, but people have fallen for old wine in new bottles before. a slicker debater or moderator 	 0
Co trainer and ex Manchester United legend , Ryan Giggs , has denied there are problems between Louis van Gaal and himself because his wife is too old !A good friend of Ryan , who we found wandering around the bus station , talking to Jaggedone ' s CIA ' s ( Cockroach Infiltration Army ) star footy reporter Guzza Bowlegs Bigcock ( Or is that Dion Dublin ? ) gave the following statement :" No Guzza we aint got no problems because he only likes young bits of crumpet and LVG ' s missus ain ' t no spring chicken if you get what I mean ! The tabloids and mucky press love inventing stories about him and old King Louis and we just laugh about it all the time because he likes a young bit of crumpet too , it ' s obvious , he ' s double Dutch !" Now , if it was one of those sexy SWAGS who hook up with out multi millionaire super kids , he might just have a problem , but even they ain ' t interested in a grey haired balding 40 year old ex legend even if he has still got a pair of sexy snake hips and can dribble in the right places , nod , nod , wink , wink ! "So there you have it , he is as clean as a Welsh whistle and the only problem that he has with King Louis is understanding his incredible Double Dutch , for which he has employed a rather tasty 20 year old , multi lingual , Dutch red district queen to do the translating !Meanwhile , back at the training complex , star CIA reporter Guzza Bowlegs Bigcock was seen scampering through the showers trying to find out if anybody has ever beaten Dion ' s ' huge one ' !"

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 12 11" Notably , the 7 percentage point increase in the share at the top is nearly double the 4 percentage point increase at the bottom , " according to Pew .The Pew data illustrates the impact of the Great Recession on lower income groups especially , however . The lower class has grown from 25 percent in 1971 to 29 percent . This means high income families are much wealthier than middle class families than they were several decades ago . And there are also nearly twice as many of them .Certain demographic groups moved up at a higher rate than others , and " winners " included women , members of all races except Hispanics , and married households . Demographic groups whose shift has been negative include Hispanics , twenty somethings , and anyone with less than a bachelor ' s degree .The drop for Hispanics reflects an increase in the number of immigrants starting out at a lower income , according to Pew , because when considered separately , Hispanic immigrants and and US citizens alike advanced . The biggest gain goes to senior citizens , and the Pew authors suggest this is a policy success story ." Not coincidentally , the poverty rate among people 65 and older fell from 24 . 6 in 1970 to 10 in 2014 , " according to Pew . " Evidence shows that rising Social Security benefits have played a key role in improving the economic status of older adults . "Younger Americans looking at the job market feel less confident about their middle class prospects . The approaching doom of the middle class may be a myth , but the market is shifting as jobs become either unskilled or highly skilled , without much in between , reported Mark Trumbull for The Christian Science Monitor :Optimism about the future persists among moderate income Americans to a degree that may seem surprising . It has just been tempered . The new watchword is realism ? the awareness that the economically ascendant America of the baby boomers has now been superseded by an era of sluggish wage growth and financial setbacks .Half the American population is still solidly in the middle class , according to the study , so it ' s early yet for funeral arrangements . The concern is that the middle class has held a solid majority for four decades but is now declining because of growth in the lower and upper income tiers .In an election year , the health of the middle class will likely come up , as both Democrats and Republicans support a strong middle class . If the Pew data is true , then much of what would revitalize the middle class could be well within the grasp of policymakers . Anything that promotes stable families and quality education is likely to energize the middle class . 	 0
Tropical Cyclone Evan is battering the South Pacific with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and gusts up to 144 mph , according to the Navy ' s Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii .And things might get worse . Forecasters predict Evan could get stronger over the next 36 hours , evolving into a more powerful Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 126 mph , as it creeps southwest , away from the Samoan islands and toward Fiji .Fiji ' s meteorological service said Evan was expected to arrive in that country ' s waters by Sunday .The National Weather Service in Pago Pago , American Samoa , canceled its gale warning Thursday , but reiterated high surf and small craft advisories for the islands , expecting gusts up to 35 mph , heavy rain and towering waves .There were reports of two deaths in Samoa , an independent country with a population of 183 , 000 . American Samoa is a U . S . territory with a population of about 55 , 000 .Journalist Cherelle Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corp . that there was heavy damage in the Samoan capital of Apia , with houses flattened by the storm .Storm surge and high surf , which the U . S . National Weather Service said could reach 20 feet in the islands , was making a mess of Apia , Jackson said , adding water and power service had been knocked out .Many of the open style Samoan homes , or fales , which don ' t have windows or doors , sustained heavy damage , she said ." I don ' t think we were well prepared because the warning didn ' t get serious until late last night , " Jackson said in a phone interview with the Australian network .Jackson said food could be a problem once the storm passes because the trees that supply Samoan staples , such as breadfruit , taro and bananas , had taken a heavy hit from the storm ' s winds . " The breadfruits are just all over the road , " she said .The New Zealand high commissioner in Apia , Nick Hurley , told Radio New Zealand of heavy damage ." From what I have seen and heard it has made a huge impact on , for a start , all the vegetation , the trees , the infrastructure , all around Apia the power is out . A lot of people don ' t have any water . The trees have snapped , in a lot of cases have actually come down across roads , crashed into the fale , onto the houses , " Hurley is quoted as saying . 	 0
ANGOLA , LA Saying he ' s seen " a lot of people come through here in his day " and met prisoners of every type , longtime Louisiana State Penitentiary death row guard Dwayne McFadden confided Wednesday that he ' s always had a bit of a soft spot for the innocent ones .While the 57 year old corrections officer said he strives to remain detached and professional when dealing with inmates awaiting execution , he told reporters that , invariably , the men convicted of capital crimes they didn ' t commit somehow always manage to find a way into his heart , remaining there even after they are put to death ." When you ' ve been here as long as I have , you start to develop a special relationship with the guys who aren ' t actually guilty , " said McFadden , noting that there have been so many such inmates during his 30 years on the job he has lost exact count . " You get to know them , know their stories . And as they keep exhausting appeal after appeal , you can ' t help but take a liking to them . "" Even though it ' s against prison rules , I ' ll sometimes let the innocent guys have an extra 10 minutes in the yard , or maybe a couple extra library books , " he added . " Little gestures here and there . It ' s the least I can do for them . "McFadden acknowledged he has felt a personal and enduring emotional connection to virtually every one of the not guilty death row inmates he has known , from those assigned shoddy public defenders who failed to secure a plea deal , to those sentenced on the basis of clearly fabricated police evidence and later recanted testimony , to those who were mentally unfit to stand trial in the first place .Often , he said , the prisoners who have stirred something inside him have been the ones who had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time , or were forced to sign confessions after being kept awake for dozens of hours of harsh , coercive questioning . Additionally , McFadden added that many of his favorite inmates over the years were simply victims of a bygone era before the use of DNA tests became standard ." Most of them are just these real nice guys from poor , tough neighborhoods , though I ' ve seen falsely convicted men from all walks of life behind these walls , " McFadden said of the maximum security facility ' s death row population . " Interesting thing is , no matter where they come from , or what their background , the innocent ones all have this same look in their eyes that really melts your heart . "" It gets me every time , " he continued . " They really are some of the sweetest people you ' ll ever meet . "The guard explained that while all of the individuals under his watch are damaged on some level , and the worst are merciless killers for whom there is no place in society , the ones who are not actually murderers tend to be much more likable . According to McFadden , when these inmates loudly protest their imprisonment or lash out physically in defiance of the system that has wronged them , he always feels a twinge of sadness whenever he has to pepper spray them into submission and then forcibly pin them against the floor until they are shackled ." You can ' t help but feel for these guys as people when you ' re keeping them under 24 hour suicide watch in the days leading up to their execution , " he said , adding that a nod and a little wave goes a long way when an innocent man is being led to his death . " I have to say , I get kind of attached to them , and I miss them when they ' re gone . "" But most of the time , that feeling doesn ' t last too long , " he added . " There are always more coming in . " 	 1

I ' m glad Paige has a lot of hype around her because I feel when I beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more . 'At only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name , VanZant has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012 .After three wins and a decision defeat , she was signed by the UFC for the newly formed 115lb division and initially selected to appear on the Ultimate Fighter .But due to her being under 21 at the time , she was unable to take part and instead made her debut against Kailin Curran last November , stopping the 24 year old in the third and final round .'

SANDUSKY , OH Area resident Pamela Meyers was delighted to receive yet another thoughtful CD recommendation from Amazon . com Friday , confirming that the online retail giant has a more thorough , individualized , and nuanced understanding of Meyers ' taste than the man who occasionally claims to love her , husband Dean Meyers ." To come home from a long day at work and see the message about the new Norah Jones album waiting for me , it just made my week , " said Meyers , 36 , who claimed she was touched that the company paid such attention to her . " It feels nice to be noticed once in a while , you know ? "Amazon , which has been tracking Meyers ' purchases since she first used the site to order Football For Dummies in preparation for attending the 2004 Citrus Bowl as part of her husband ' s 10th wedding anniversary plans , has shown impressive accuracy at recommending books , movies , music , and even clothing that perfectly match Meyers ' tastes . While the powerful algorithms that power Amazon ' s recommendations generator do not have the advantage of being able to observe Meyers ' body language , verbal intonation , or current personal possessions , they have nonetheless proven more effective than Dean , who bases his gift giving choices primarily on what is needed around the house , what he would like to own , and , most notably , what objects are nearby ." I don ' t know how Amazon picked up on my growing interest in world music so quickly , but I absolutely love this traditional Celtic CD , " Meyers said . " I like it so much more than that Keith Urban thing Dean got me . I ' m really not sure what made him think I like country music . "Meyers said she was especially moved that the online merchant remembered that she had once purchased an Ian McEwan book , and immediately reminded when the author released a new novel . Moreover , despite only having had 37 hours of direct interaction with Meyers , Amazon was still able to detect her strong interest in actor Paul Giamatti , unlike husband Dean who often teases Meyers about her nonexistent crush on Tom Cruise .Meyers said that her husband , whose gift choices have never reflected any outward recognition of her desire to learn Spanish , nor of the fact that she looks terrible in orange , rarely , if ever , communicates with Meyers while away on any of his frequent business trips ." I was having some tea from that Nebraska Cornhuskers mug Dean got me for Valentine ' s Day , when a little e mail from Amazon popped up out of the blue , " Meyers said . " Just completely out of the blue . "" It was nice to know that on my birthday , someone or something was out there thinking about me , and what boxed sets I wanted , " she added .Though " it could only be a coincidence , " Meyers admitted that she became emotional during a recent " bad day " when the site recommended the DVD The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg . " Dean and I saw it on one of our first dates , and I remember it being such a great night not just for the movie , but how everything felt so natural , how we seemed to be on the same wavelength , " Meyers said . " It was the first time I thought , ' Yes . This is the one . ' "While Amazon is almost always accurate , the company does occasionally make a gift recommendation that does not suit her tastes , such as a recent suggestion of camping gear and an all weather backpack . Still , Meyers lauded Amazon ' s attempts at spontaneity ." At least it ' s trying , " said Meyers , whose husband will once again surprise her with their fourth romantic getaway to his hometown of Kenton , DE sometime in March . " And maybe I would like camping if I ever tried it . Amazon ' s usually right about these things . "Meyers , who has spent the past 15 years with a man who still believes she enjoys attending car shows , said she has kept her Amazon recommendation e mails a secret from her husband so as not to corrupt the " deep and unstated understanding " between her and the popular website ." Sure , I could send him the link to my Wish List , but that really defeats the purpose of gifts , as far as I ' m concerned , " Meyers said .For his part , Dean has promised to make a concerted effort to pay closer attention to his wife ' s habits in order to choose more appropriate and tasteful gifts . He said that she will be " pleasantly surprised " with his new strategy , enrolling her for the next three years in the Oprah Book Club ." I know she ' s really into The View , so I just figured this would be perfect , " Meyers said . " And I know she ' ll love taking moonlight drives on our new riding mower together , too . " 	 1
Moscow Russian President Putin has become bored with not having a worthy adversary on the foreign policy landscape due to President Obama ' s lack of interest in world affairs . The Russian leader always welcomes a challenge and believes having a United States that at least pretends to care is in the world ' s interest .To this end , Mr Putin has come up with a plan to pull President Obama out of the shadows and hit him the one place that will surely get the president ' s attention : carpet bombing America ' s upscale golf courses .17 year old White House spokesman , Josh Earnest , has already reacted to the rumors by stating , " That ' s not funny . You don ' t even joke about doing that . "The mood around the White House has indeed taken on a serious tone since word of the aggression leaked out . President Obama has ordered all available military personnel and equipment to finer golf courses , putting greens and Putt Putts across the country .Mr Obama has also cancelled all fundraising activities and vacation plans to return immediately to the White House Situation Room . Mrs Obama is reportedly livid about the change in the president ' s schedule but said , " Neither hell nor high water is going to keep me from another vacation ! "" Russia can do what they want in other parts of the world , " President Obama angrily remarked , " but our pristine golf courses are off limits ! I ' ll see Mr Putin in Hell before I preside over any damage at Augusta ! "President Putin , sensing he had gotten under President Obama ' s skin with this tactic , has jokingly agreed to have his bomber pilots and missile launching personnel yell , " Fore ! " just before firing their weapons .This latest move by President Putin has ratcheted up the tension between the two powerful countries to its highest level since the final battle scene in the movie Red October . 	 1
washington the justice department on tuesday weighed in on one of the most explosive issues in american politics, filing a lawsuit to overturn a tough new arizona immigration law that has sharply divided people along partisan, ideological and ethnic lines. it also asked the federal courts to grant an injunction to stop enforcement of the measure before it takes effect late this month. arizona's law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question the residency status of people in the course of enforcing another law. it also targets businesses that hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them. justice department lawyers argued that the state statute should be declared invalid because it has improperly preempted federal law. " in our constitutional system, the power to regulate immigration is exclusively vested in the federal government, " the brief said. " the immigration framework set forth by congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state. " how do you feel about the arizona immigration law? however, arizona gov. jan brewer said it was " wrong that our own federal government is suing the people of arizona for helping to enforce federal immigration law. " " today's filing is nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds, " brewer said in a statement. " these funds could be better used against the violent mexican cartels than the people of arizona. " the government's brief said the u. s. constitution and federal law " don't permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country. " " although a state may adopt regulations that have an indirect or incidental effect on aliens, a state may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law, " the brief said. " the state of arizona has crossed this constitutional line. " the brief contends that the arizona law " disrupts federal enforcement priorities and resources that focus on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety.... if allowed to go into effect, its mandatory enforcement scheme will conflict with and undermine the federal government's careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities and objectives. " the justice department highlighted statements in support of the lawsuit from the sheriff of arizona's santa cruz county and several department of homeland security officials, among others. president barack obama said in a speech july 1 that the arizona measure has " fanned the flames of an already contentious debate. " among other things, it puts pressure on police officers to enforce rules that are " unenforceable " while making communities less safe in part, by making people more reluctant to report crimes, he said. the law also has " the potential of violating the rights of innocent american citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound. " arizona's two republican senators, however, immediately blasted the decision to file the lawsuit. " the american people must wonder whether the obama administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law, " sens. jon kyl and john mccain said in a statement. the top republican on the house judiciary committee also ripped the decision. " not only does this lawsuit reveal the obama administration's contempt for immigration laws and the people of arizona, it reveals contempt for the majority of the american people who support arizona's efforts to reduce human smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, " said rep. lamar smith, r texas. " arizona's law simply applies state penalties to acts already illegal under federal law. " rep. ann kirkpatrick, d arizona, released a statement calling the lawsuit a " sideshow. " " a court battle between the federal government and arizona will not move us closer to securing the border or fixing america's broken immigration system, " she said. brewer, a republican, said the arizona law was designed " to complement, not supplant, enforcement of federal immigration laws, " and that she would fight the government lawsuit with the help of a legal defense fund set up to pay the legal fees. " our laws will be found to be constitutional because that is exactly what they are, " brewer's statement said. obama renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform last week, calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue reflecting deep social and political divisions. seeking an elusive middle ground on the subject, the president highlighted the importance of immigrants to american history and progress while acknowledging the fear and frustration many feel with a system that he said seems " fundamentally broken. " he asserted that the majority of americans are ready to embrace reform legislation that would help resolve the status of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. in his july 1 speech, obama warned that rounding up everyone in the country who has entered illegally would be both " logistical 	 0
Mr Tusk hopes to present EU leaders as early as Tuesday with a draft text of his proposed solutions to the UK ' s concerns over migration , sovereignty , competitiveness and protection for non eurozone countries , for discussion at the upcoming Council summit on February 18 19 .Agreement in February is regarded as crucial if the referendum is to be staged before the summer holidays .Downing Street said the PM had secured a significant assurance that a proposed " emergency brake " on welfare payments to EU workers could be triggered immediately after a vote to remain in the EU , on the basis of existing levels of immigration .Mr Cameron ' s official spokeswoman insisted that Britain had made " substantial progress " , but added : " There is more work to do in all four areas more work in some areas than in others . "She told a regular Westminster media briefing : " There is more hard work to be done both in terms of the proposals that are tabled and how far they go in addressing the reforms we are seeking , but then let ' s be clear in the run up to either the February European Council or whenever we get a deal , there will be a lot of hard work to get 27 other member states signed up to what we need .It remained unclear how the proposed emergency brake would operate and who would have the final say on when the measure could be activated and how long it would remain in effect .The mechanism has been put forward by Brussels as an alternative to Mr Cameron ' s plan to impose a unilateral four year curb which other member states ruled out as discriminatory and in breach of the freedom of movement principle .The PM agreed to accept it as a " stop gap " measure on the condition he received assurances the existing pressure on the UK would meet the threshold to trigger it and it could remain in place .One critical stumbling block is the UK ' s demand for it to be allowed to remain in place " long enough to resolve the underlying problem " perhaps as long as seven years .Supporters of British withdrawal from the EU dismissed the frantic round of negotiations which saw the PM cancel a planned trip to Scandinavia last week for hastily arranged talks with European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker as a choreographed display designed to convince voters that Mr Cameron has been forced to fight hard for significant concessions .Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said : " The theatrics and drama of David Cameron ' s sham renegotiation continues and he is playing us for fools ." In 24 hours when to no doubt great fanfare Cameron returns with a ' deal ' with Brussels , it looks like it ' ll be nothing more than tinkering round the edges of our relationship with the European Union and will not go any way to dealing with the wholesale loss of sovereignty to the EU , the eye watering cost of it , or indeed go any way to bring back genuine control of our borders from the EU . "Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the pro Brexit Vote Leave campaign , said : " The final outcome of these negotiations will be a set of deeply trivial reforms that won ' t bring powers back from Brussels ." Even with the avalanche of spin that will accompany the final deal , the renegotiation won ' t take back control for the British public . The only way to do that is to Vote Leave . "But Mr Cameron ' s spokeswoman denied the wrangling was confected : " I wouldn ' t accept that at all . Look at the amount of hard work , time and effort the Prime Minister , other senior ministers and senior Government officials have had to put into this . Look at the work we have had to do with a number of other European countries who have raised concerns ." These are significant , far reaching reforms and that is why it is taking time . "She insisted Mr Cameron was still willing to wait until the end of next year to hold the referendum , in order to secure the best possible reforms for Britain : " The PM is most focused on getting the right deal . That is what matters . We are not in a hurry . "Among the proposals currently on the table were reforms to prevent non EU nationals using sham marriages with Europeans in order to maintain their right to remain in the UK , she confirmed . 	 0
Scott Brown has closed the door on a possible move to England by pledging the next four years of his career to Celtic .With his present contract expiring in 2016 , speculation was mounting that the 29 year old may be tempted to explore avenues down south sooner rather than later .Crystal Palace were the latest side to be linked with the Fifer last week but Brown has now headed off any such moves at the pass by committing his future to Celtic until he turns 33 .Celtic captain Scott Brown has signed a new deal keeping him at the club until the summer of 2018The 29 year old has been at the club since 2007 , when he joined the Scottish giants from HibernianBrown , who now looks set to end his playing days as a Celtic player , said : ' It ' s an absolute privilege to extend my contract with Celtic , a brilliant football club and with such incredible supporters . This is a place that I call home .' Being Celtic captain is a tremendous honour and it is a role which I cherish dearly . The team is in a great place just now and we ' re all right behind the manager and the backroom team as they build for the future .' I will do all I can with the manager and all the players at the club to deliver the success which our supporters deserve . 'Celtic have previously been reluctant to offer bumper long term deals to players approaching the age of 30 but they have made an exception in the case of the man who is also now skipper of Scotland .Brown is keen to pursue a coaching career and it ' s understood the prospect of gaining such experience while still playing formed part of the contract negotiations .Brown talks to assistant manager and Scotland legend John Collins during a Celtic training sessionNational captains Brown and Wayne Rooney shake hands before the recent friendly at Celtic ParkThe midfielder came through the ranks at Hibs and made his debut in 2002 before winning the League Cup with the Easter Road side in 2007 .He moved to Celtic for 4 . 4million that summer and has gone on to make nearly 300 appearances for the club .After a sluggish start to life in green and white under Gordon Strachan , he has developed into an invaluable part of Ronny Deila ' s side .The Norwegian feared Brown might miss much of his first season at Celtic when he was stretchered off in a pre season friendly against Rapid Vienna , but the midfielder recovered from what proved to be a serious hamstring injury in just two months .In signing the new deal , he has given the clearest indication yet that he ' s content with every aspect of life at Celtic .A winner of four Scottish Championships , two Scottish Cups and a League Cup in his time at Parkhead , Brown is now in line to complete 11 years ' service with the club a rarity in the modern age .However , he will be watching from the stands when his team mates host Dundee after being sent off against Aberdeen before the international break . 	 0
MIDDLESEX , CT Staring at the rec room clock Monday , Herman Oster and 23 of his fellow Eldercare Nursing Home residents waited for the day ' s agonizing " Funtime " to finally end ." Not too much longer now , " said Oster , 83 , midway through the two hour descent into tedium . " After we throw the big ball back and forth , there ' s usually one more song , and then it ' s over at last . "Listed on the Eldercare Events Calendar as " Funtime with Judy , " the weekly event is hosted by Judy Lyon , one of Eldercare ' s two recreational therapists ." On other days , we have scheduled events like bingo or bridge or movie time , " the 34 year old Lyon said . " But on Tuesdays , I like to mix it up a little and surprise the residents . During Funtime , anything goes ! "Previous Funtime activities have included leatherworking , macrame , and waving brightly colored flags ." I always plan something that involves everyone , " said Lyon , who in 1995 received her master ' s degree in recreational therapy from Central Connecticut State University . " I try to provide the residents with socialization opportunities that will also improve motor function , increase relaxation , and build awareness skills . "According to Oster , the most painful Funtime activity is " Remember When ? , " in which Lyon asks residents questions about their lives before entering the nursing home ." Sometimes , Judy asks us to talk about our kids , and that always hurts , because I hardly ever see them , " Oster said . " I really don ' t like talking about it in front of the group . "John Edwards , 91 , is similarly uncomfortable with " Remember When ? "" One time , Judy asked me what my first car was , " Edwards said . " I had no idea . I just couldn ' t remember . I was so embarrassed . "Despite the depressing , non fun nature of Funtime , many residents still feel compelled to attend ." Whenever I see Judy in the hall , she asks if I ' m going to Funtime this week , " said Doris Heckel , 80 . " She ' s so smiley , I feel bad saying no . "" If I don ' t go , Judy always asks me where I was , " Heckel continued . " I can get away with skipping every third time or so , but if I miss two in a row , she really lets me have it . "Some residents said they attend because of the availability of food and beverages ." The meals here are worse than the K rations I had to choke down during the Big One , but they make up for it during Funtime by rolling out cake and coffee , " said Sam Cropper , 84 . " A nice piece of chocolate bundt helps ease the pain of Judy ' s interminable sing alongs . "Cropper , who spends most days in his room reading the newspaper and writing letters to long deceased friends , said he appreciates the attention paid to residents by Lyon , despite the unbearable nature of the activities she plans ." Most of us are still adjusting to not being able to get around like we used to , so it can get pretty lonely here at Eldercare , " Cropper said . " It ' s nice to have someone to talk to , even if it ' s about something dumb like what kind of flower we ' d like to be . "Added Cropper : " There are many things I ' d like to see and do , but since my stroke , I just haven ' t had the energy . Max Franklin has been the same way ever since he broke his hip . I guess fear of loneliness is what drives most of us to endure the distraction of Funtime . " 	 1
The Family Research Council is know to be the most important anti gay advocacy group in the country . Lesser know is its attitude toward women . It ' s head , Tony Perkins and many others belong to denominations which bar women from serving as pastors because the Bible only prohibits a woman from being a " spiritual leader and says they should ' stand by their man . ' " Some members go so far as to say that being a " spiritual leader " cannot be separated from being a political leader , so a woman shouldn ' t hold public office .Richard Pig , the head of the Southern Baptist Convention ' s political arm , said that it was perfectly fine for a woman to serve in the role of being a public servant as long as she begs for her husband ' s consent . Many Christians would agree with that assessment , that ' s because wifely submission also known as complementarian theology is central to the faith of many evangelicals .The well know evangelical Sara Jane Preposterous explains , the " husband is the spiritual head of the household , the wife his obedient ' helpmeet , ' carries the holy vessel for their children in her sacred womb , and must be a devoted mother , wear amor and be and warrior for the faith . She looks askance at women who want to be in politics and calls them whores .Sam Meathead , a former Pennsylvania state legislator who heads the American Pastor ' s Network , which works to organize politically engaged conservative pastors , cited the book of Isaiah this month to argue that having women in political leadership is a mark of judgment upon a nation and will lead to eternal damnation for all its " perverted , deranged citizens . " " God does raise up women , " he explained , " but that ' s to obey their masters , otherwise know as ' husbands . ' "And Jesse Lee Peterson , a frequent guest on conservative talk shows , has also argued that women should never have been given the right to vote . While the well known conservative evangelical , Phyllis Shitfly , thinks women should vote , she asks " Why should a woman be President when we have had great men in that office with subservient wives playing supporting roles . "With this background in mind it is no surprise that the Donald Trump campaign has outreach to misogynist evangelicals called the Medieval Opinion Maker ' s Advisory Council . The group has published a pamphlet entitled , " Know Your Place Lady . " In it John Porcine of the First Baptist Church in Babble , TX , points out that in ancient Israel , where God made the Jews his chosen people , women did not hold public office ." If Holy King God had felt that women should be political leaders , He would have chosen a culture where women were in that role . That God did not , binds us today to his choice against women leaders because we must all abide by the teachings of the Holy Ghost , who wrote the infallible , hallowed text with the aid of Her Blessedness , the Ghostess , he argues .Professor Peter Condum of The College of Sacred Limb Wisdom Seminary in Broken Glass , GA , takes a rather dim view of what he calls " the lesser sex . " He points out in the creation myth in the Book of Genesis , the evil snake goes to Eve to tempt her into giving Adam the apple from the tree of the fruit of knowledge . " The wise snake knew that the silly , over sexed , vile weakling Eve would succumb to the snake , not to the stronger , manly Adam ." So sex came into the world ' cause they were naked and ashamed of their evil genitals and nipples . We don ' t need women to tempt men and take them away from the nation ' s business , " he writes .Pastor Peter P . Peter of Full Gospel JumboChurch in Piedmont Ville SC , takes a practical view where he explains in the Trump pamphlet , " After women got the vote we had the disaster of prohibition , world wide depression , and World War II , the most horrendous , genocidal war in history . One would be a fool not to see the causal correlation . "Weather candidate Trump can increase his vote by appealing to the vote of the followers of complementarian theology , mostly in Southern rural areas , will be ascertained on Election Day . 	 1
Dozens of figures from the Irish Republic ' s National Wax Museum have been damaged or stolen after a " rave " party at a warehouse , officials say .Models of famous children ' s characters , including Teletubbies and Bob the Builder , were among those taken from the museum ' s collection in Dublin .Police were " at a loss " as to why the figures and their clothes were stolen , and the thieves left no clues .Local sex shop owner Jack " Buzzing " D ' Ildo , told us , " Well , the police don ' t have any idea at all . Why they didn ' t ask me I don ' t know . I ' ve had loads of people in here with the things trying to flog ' em . All they do is drill a couple or three holes , and there you are . Saves all that blowing , see . Obvious , really , when you think about it . Most of the girls round here have faces like bags of spanners , so a little entertainment with a wax Britney is better than nothing , you know . But the Teletubbies are a bit of a speciality market , really . "Also stolen from the museum were several lots of clothes and uniforms . Jack had his ideas about them , too ." There ' s been a sudden interest in fancy dress parties , so I guess that ' s what they ' re for . There again , some of the guys round here are a bit weird . A wax Britney in a Nazi Uniform might well be a turn on for some , but I ' m not too sure about Bob the Builder , though . "The police investigation is continuing , and undercover officers have been spotted trying high heels on . 	 1
The 152 year old Melbourne Cup is back on home soil , after a surprise win by Green Moon in Australia ' s most famous horse race .Bred in Ireland but owned and trained in Australia , Green Moon ' s victory will be sweet for local horse trainers and racing fans , who have seen the cup go to international entries in recent years .The six year old stallion took the winner ' s share of the AUD6 million ( USD6 . 2 million ) prize money , beating Fiorente second and Jakkalberry third .Green Moon was ridden by Hong Kong based Australian jockey Brett Prebble .The win also marks the fourth time a horse owned by Lloyd Williams , an Australian businessman and property developer , has won the high stakes contest that is watched by millions across the country .Green Moon was an early contender but questions emerged over his form after a disappointing seventh place at his last race just over a week ago .Six of the eight favorites in this year ' s race were from overseas and were dubbed by Australian media as " international invaders . " Last year ' s winner was Dunaden , a French stallion and another French horse Americain won the race in 2010 ." There is nothing like winning the Melbourne Cup . The Melbourne cup is Australia , " says trainer Mark Kavanagh , whose horse Shocking won in 2009 .Home grown entries have been overshadowed by foreign contenders as a lucrative prize pot lures horses bred and trained mainly in Europe .The prize money has become all the more tantalizing in the past few years as the Australian dollar has strengthened against other major currencies , making it worth the 150 , 000 it costs to transport and stable the horses during their stay down under ." Well they ' ve got to travel half way across the globe , they ' ve got to settle in and they ' ve got to get used to our dry Australian tracks but at the end of the day there is six million Australian dollars waiting for them so there are plenty of them that are going to have a crack , " Kavanagh said before this year ' s race .It ' s hard to overstate the significance of the race in the Australian sporting and social calendar . Imagine the party atmosphere of the Kentucky Derby with the tradition and pageantry of the Grand National and Royal Ascot .A novice ' s guide to the Melbourne CupHeld at Flemington Racecourse , the race meet attracts some 100 , 000 punters dressed in their finest hats and formal attire , along with more comical takes on the occasion . It is also watched by millions at bars , homes and outdoor screens across the country ." I mean who else has a public holiday for a horse race ? We do and we think it ' s perfectly natural . "The race , part of a week long meeting , also has a huge economic impact for the city , with millions bet and more spent . Race goers alone are estimated to spend nearly 30 million during the week , while the carnival and other events that accompany it bring in 350 million , Doyle said .Cup memories : The legs that stopped a nationBritish horse trainer Luca Cumani , who has twice narrowly missed out on winning the cup , says another reason why there are more international entries is because European horses tend to be bred for covering longer distances compared to their Australian counterparts .However , he says the international horses have their own obstacles to overcome . The animals have to travel for 50 to 60 hours and then face two weeks of quarantine . Quarantine regulations also make it difficult for international trainers to bring in their own food so the horses have to get used to the local cuisine .Kavanagh , like most Australian trainers , is not particularly sympathetic to the foreign horses ' plight , but as long as the prize money remains high , it ' s likely that entrants will come from far and wide . 	 0
ATLANTIC CITY , NJ A beaming Donald Brant , general manager of Bally ' s Atlantic City , reported that the casino had " an unbelievable night " Monday , cleaning up at the blackjack table , on the slot machines , and elsewhere ." Man , we were on fire all night , " Brant said . " It seemed like every time a casino patron pulled that slots lever , it came up a loser . Whenever somebody told the blackjack dealer to hit on 12 , they drew a 10 . We could do no wrong . "By the end of the night , the casino walked away a major winner , up 515 , 274 ." I had a sense that we were doing pretty well , " Brant said . " So I checked around with the pit bosses , and it turned out that nearly all the dealers and croupiers were way , way ahead . It was amazing . A night like that only comes along five , six times a week , tops . "While most players are content to focus on one or two games , the casino participated in every available coin operated machine and table game , including roulette , blackjack , craps , Spanish 21 , pai gow , baccarat , and Let It Ride ." We ' ve got a system , " Brant said . " Our strategy is to bet against all the customers who come in here . Then we spread our bets around to each and every table and machine in the casino and keep at it for the long haul . We were down about 200 at one of the roulette tables , but were up on everything else , so we came out pretty much ahead . Actually , more than half a million ahead . "Bally ' s even fared well at the slot machines , an area that traditionally yields the lowest rate of success ." You know how they say your worst odds are on the slots ? " Brant said . " Well , we made over 33 , 000 in slots last night . Can you believe it ? We were unstoppable . "Brant attributed his casino ' s impressive showing to a combination of luck and old fashioned horse sense ." We try not to play stupid , " Brant said . " We never gamble more than we can afford to lose . And we try to never lose our heads . We leave that to the customers . We set aside a certain amount to gamble that ' s our kitty and if we double our money , we only play with our winnings after that . Right now , the kitty stands at around 176 , 500 , 000 . "Bally ' s is in the midst of an impressive winning streak , coming out ahead an astonishing 6 , 753 nights in a row ." This is quite a tear we ' re on , " Brant said . " It ' s best if you go in with the attitude that you ' re just there to have fun and not to win big . That said , it ' s always a lot more fun when you ' re winning . And , baby , did we win that night ! "According to John Patrick , author of So You Want To Be A Gambler ? , streaks like Bally ' s are uncommon ." In my years as a professional gambler , I ' ve had my share of great nights , " Patrick said . " However , I ' ve never been on a roll like the one Bally ' s is on . But then , with a guaranteed 52 percent success rate , it ' s unlikely that a casino would ever come out behind in an evening . If that were the case , casinos wouldn ' t exist as profitable entities . "In spite of its huge winnings , Bally ' s did not indulge in the traditional amenities offered to big winners , such as a free night ' s stay in the hotel or meal vouchers . Instead , the crew of the all night casino changed over to the next shift without fanfare ." Yeah , I suppose we could have partied all night with champagne , a penthouse suite , and all the rest , but we had a casino to run , " Brant said . " The thing a lot of people don ' t realize about successful gamblers is that it ' s hard work making outrageous sums of money . " 	 1
HALLOWED BOWELS OF CITY HALL , TORONTO , CANADA Mayor Rob Ford said he is taking a break from his re election campaign to get help for his substance abuse issues after a video filmed over the weekend showed him smoking a 20 pound brisket ." I ' ve done some dumb ass things with alcohol , crack , crack pipes , crack whores , crack stains , but my latest indiscretion has finally left me thinking , ' How the f am I not dead ! ' " Ford said in a statement released by his attorney .In the video secretly filmed by Ford ' s butcher Ford is seen using a barbecue rub on the brisket , trying to stuff it into a long cooper colored crack pipe , then taking a drag and exhaling an aromatic mesquite scented smoke , as he completely ignored the recommended smoking time of 15 hours .Ford ' s sister Kathy , a self professed addict , and a man who looks like Ford ' s shady former driver Alessandro " Sandro " Lisi , both appear in the video , trimming the brisket before Ford applied the rub and trying to light charcoals and wood chips which they stuffed into the crack pipe .The video shows Ford sweating profusely as he smokes the meat , then starting to dance and taking his clothes off , revealing a fat man ' s Chippendale outfit .The footage is part of a package of three videos Ford ' s butcher secretly filmed , and which he says is now selling as " a 3 for 1 special . "The second clip shows Ford sticking a meat injecting needle into his arm that was said to contain a lemon pepper marinade . The third video shows Ford eating the apple out of the mouth of delicately smoked whole hog ." I have a little problem with my weight too , " he said . 	 1
the chance to test their mettle against the best is what attracts players and managers to the champions league. but for one young coach who has already reached the promised land, it was the second tier of english football that provided his steepest learning curve.'the championship is really, really difficult!'basle manager paulo sousa tells sportsmail.'coaches who don't have that experience cannot realise how difficult it is.'the standard of the players is more or less the same. it makes it very competitive right through the season. you can see in the way teams'positions change throughout the season, from the bottom and the top of the league. and the dreamland the premier league is so, so close! paulo sousa gestures during a press conference at the dragao stadium ahead of facing portobasle's fabian frei, naser aliji, arlind ajeti, breel embolo, head coach sousa, adama traore, taulant xhaka, fabian schaer and behrang safari train ahead of their champions league clash at porto'i learnt a lot in that league. there were some points where i was not prepared enough, but you gain experience by doing, not just watching or listening.'it's like jumping into a swimming pool at the deep end. you can see how to do it from the side, but you will never learn unless you jump in.'and jump in is precisely what sousa did seven years ago when he left the safety of the portugal junior set up to become the face of flavio briatore and bernie ecclestone's project at queens park rangers. taking the reins under a couple of formula one moguls with a four year plan to reach the top flight might seem like a daunting prospect for a debutant manager, but not for sousa.'nothing is too soon. i will always be thankful to briatore. all the difficulties i got through at that club and all the demands he made of me gave me the opportunity to grow. it was so demanding on a daily basis 24 hours every day from the first day i arrived there.'but what of briatore's notorious habit of involving himself in managerial decisions?'he tried. but i always fight for my convictions.'basle manager paulo sousa says the championship is a highly competitive leaguesousa's first job in club management was with queens park rangers between 2008 and 2009it is widely believed that these convictions a refusal to act merely as briatore's touchline proxy are what saw sousa ejected from the loftus road hotseat after just 26 games in charge. the two time champions league winner would get a second chance at championship success just two months later though, taking over from roberto martinez at swansea in june 2009. under chairman huw jenkins, sousa was given time to get his ideas across, and a subsequent seventh placed finish the club's highest for 27 years showed it was time well spent. but the manager's progress hadn't gone unnoticed, and when moneybags leicester came calling, sousa couldn't resist. it quickly transpired that swapping the mumbles for the midlands was a mistake sousa was sacked after less than three months in charge and the former portugal international readily admits to a lapse of judgment in that summer of 2010. the portuguese coach also had a spell in charge of welsh side swansea city between 2009 and 2010as a player, sousa won the champions league with juventus and borussia dortmund ( pictured ) during his playing career, sousa also spent time with greek giants panathinaikos between 2000 and 2001'when i left swansea, my ambition pushed me to take decisions in the direction of better infrastructures, better club history and higher prospects to reach the premier league.'instead of seeing the whole forest, i saw only the beautiful tree in front of me. swansea has lots of beautiful trees, but at that moment i didn't recognise that. that i regret.'that season, with sousa clubless, swansea were promoted to the premier league under the guidance of brendan rodgers. sousa insists it was not difficult to see his former club achieve what he narrowly missed out on the previous year. instead he looked back fondly on his time there, though not everyone at the club regards the sousa era with such nostalgia. then captain and now manager garry monk has since released an outspoken autobiography in which he claimed sousa's spell at the club had been a'wasted season'and he was'glad we didn't get into the play offs as he did not deserve to be the one to take us to the premiership '. these comments resonated with sousa :'look, he's a person i want to succeed, like everyone. but unfortunately he said things about me and i don't appreciate people talking about somebody when they don't have the courage to say it up front.'he is well 	 0

Madoff , who bilked over 50 billion from his clients , said that he was and that he had just heard on CNN News that Governor Walker of Wisconsin had just turned his back on his fellow Wisconsinites .The guard remarked that he had heard all about it and wondered how one man could have the stupidity of half a dozen stupid people .USA DAYBREAK is reporting that Colorado Springs , Colorado , where Walker was born in 1967 , is so upset with Walker that they have made arrangements to take down the downtown sign which proudly proclaimed that Gov .

In a surprise move , President Obama publicly announced that he is a liberal . Apparently , he had known for a long time about his true political orientation but chose to hide it from everyone including his own family ." Yes , I am a liberal , " said Obama . " I know this may come as a shock to many people but I felt that it was time to be true to myself and come out of the closet . "The newly elected president admitted that he had known for many years that he was a liberal ." Even when I was a young boy , " said Obama . " I knew I wasn ' t like most of my friends . While they all seemed quite happy with the status quo , I often got strange stirrings whenever I engaged in so called progressive discussions or read the editorial page of The N . Y . Times . "Some observers say that Obama ' s coming out is not a big surprise given the historical signs . Although he always professed to be a moderate and sometimes even a fiscal conservative , it was clear to close friends that he had an affinity for left of center politics . Former school chum Marty Flickstein wasn ' t surprised by the President ' s recent revelation ." We all knew Barry was a little different , " said Flickstein . " We ' d all be stealing copies of our dads ' Playboys and he ' d be filching back issues of The New Republic . He said it was just to look at the pictures but we all knew he was actually reading the articles . "Back in the eighties , Obama was known to frequent so called " liberal " clubs where regulars could talk about Keynsian economics and huge government social spending without fear of exposure ." It wasn ' t easy being a liberal during the Reagan years , " said a longtime liberal comrade of Obama . " Just saying the word could destroy any electoral hopes you might have had . We all knew Barry wanted to be mainstream and hold an actual elected office but if his taste for things liberal had ever gotten out , his political career would have been finished . "During the nineties , Obama chose to keep his liberalism a secret from everyone , including his wife Michelle ." I ' m ashamed to admit it , " said America ' s 44th president . " But I didn ' t even tell the person closest to me that I had these strange yearnings . I guess she always suspected when she found all those Galbraith books in the basement but she never confronted me with them . "Now that Obama is out of the closet , it appears that he is going to let his true political colors show ." I feel so free , " said the President . " I can finally be my true self and act in accordance with my real political feelings . "Asked how this will affect his governance of the country , Obama said that he didn ' t think it would make that much of a difference ." After all , " said the President . " I ' m not one of those leather bar , tax and spend liberals . I ' m just a regular guy who happens to like social programs . One thing I will do , however , is implement a new policy for my cabinet regarding individual political orientations . Something I call : ' Don ' t ask , don ' t tell ' . " 	 1
Playa del Carmen , Mexico Donald J . Trump visited Mexico today in his recent quest to express regrets over his comments about Mexicans . Trump has consistently applied the term " rapists " to Mexicans who cross the border illegally into the United States . In a post Manafort pivot , where Trump is now Trump , Trump expressed his regrets by going directly to the Mexican people in their homeland .Trump visited Cancun , Mexico , a resort town , to give his message . He arrived by helicopter with a tired and worn looking Chris Christie , the NJ governor whose continued absence in his state means he is no longer eligible to vote for President since he fails to meet the state ' s residency requirements . The pair came straight from a Washington , DC intelligence briefing .While at a resort near Cancun , Trump announced to the all white crowd of American tourists his regrets about statements he made about Mexicans . Relying on a teleprompter , Trump stated , " Let me just say , I express regrets that I called you all rapists , it ' s not true , you know , well it is somewhat true , and drugs too , but let me just say I regret that you have such problems here . "Trump then carried on with his stump speech about the need for a wall that borders the two countries that Mexico will pay for , and finished with " Su casa es mi casa ! "A number of Mexicans , all paid staff of the resort , listened as they served drinks to the tourists . Some recorded the speech on their iPhones .Going off script , Trump added , " I need to say this though , Mexicans are great people and I do regret saying all that stuff I said and causing personal pain , although it helped me speak to my base and win , but now I am not able to expand from that , which pains me greatly and I regret that . "At the end of the announcement , Trump called for drinks " on him " and a dance party ensued . Revelers wore sombreros and fake mustaches , distributed by the Trump campaign , and everyone received a name tag that said " ! Hola ! My name is Hay sus . "At one point Christie fell asleep in a hammock just before someone broke out a pi ata . Trump was blindfolded and given a large paddle to hit the pi ata . Unfortunately , the blindfolded Trump smacked Christie on the buttocks , twice , and Christie woke up with a big yelp . Trump stated to the wounded Christie , " Is that you Chrissy ? if you are going to sleep , get on that helicopter and get back to NJ , otherwise join the party . "Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte , and three other swimmers , had arrived straight from Rio to the resort and partied throughout the night playing air guitar , peeing in the pool and behind a local gas station , and using their hands to simulate mock pistols to their heads . At one point Christie and the four drunken swimmers sang and performed a Mexican hat dance to a Spanish version of Springsteen ' s " Born to Run . "As the Mexican staff cleaned up , Trump remarked that " There is no place for blatant racism in America . Mexicans are hard workers , they do great work for me by the way , really great cleaning crew throughout the entire Trump organization . "The party ended with a chant , " Build that wall , build that wall . "The resort reported that Trump ' s staff left without paying the liquor bill . 	 1
Depends Adult Diapers ( D . A . D ) , has announced it will be a major sponsor of the upcoming Desert Trip Concerts this November in Indio , CA . The featured artists at the two weekend shows include the Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , Paul McCartney and other early practitioners of rock and roll .A spokesperson said , " This is the perfect storm for our product . An event catering to older , quaisi mobile attendees , roaming large open fields situated in the middle of nowhere spending endless hours in nomadic festival seating . Throw in an odd assortment of food , drink and opiates punctuated by periods of spastic movement , well it all leads to the inevitable urge to purge ." Then it ' s a half hour to wade through a mass of overly ripe concert goers just to stand in line for what passes as a toilet at the campgrounds . And of course you have to find your way back ." We want to address that problem with both generic and commemorative personal depositories . And not just at this venue but others such as political rallies , amusement parks , excluding water parks of course , TSA checkpoints and NASCAR . "With that in mind the company plans on rolling out a new campaign geared to younger consumers who see Depends as targeted for an older demographic . " There ' s a huge untapped void between early childhood and early dementia and other incontinence issues the elderly face . " A spokesperson said ." We ' re introducing a new line called ' Freedom ' for the active generation . It will appeal to those who can ' t or may not want to interrupt whatever adventures they are pursuing mountain climbing , biking , hake sack , riding the subway , eating an energy bar to download personal waste ." ' Freedom means Depends ' is the proposed slogan . ' the spokesperson added . " It has a whiff on synergy yet is a term that actually is somewhat cutting edge Orwellian in nature . "Agreements are reportedly in place with not just the performers at this event but other bands and personalities as well . One partnership that was leaked to the press is with the Kardashians .They will promote a line of Freedoms called ' Pooties ' giving women the opportunity to personally create the bloated derriere look they ' re known for at a fraction of the price of an augmentation . Not to be outdone , Caitlyn Jenner will introduce a model suitable for both men and women called ' Jenders ' .One sticking point with local officials is a possible conflict of interest in the insistence that Depends manage the Porta Potties . The company has plans to use less than a dozen toilets where a recent Coachella concert series had over three hundred units .The company issued a press release defending the limited portals . They pointed out they have to absorb the cost of retrofitting each unit to make them suitable for transgender users although they were not specific as to what that upgrade would need to be .The spokesperson summed it up with " If you do the math they ' re a couple of compelling reasons why our product is for everyone number one and number two . " 	 1
WASHINGTON A new study released this week by the U . S . Bureau of Masochism has concluded that American nipples are critically under clamped , bolstering long held suspicions that the nation is rapidly losing interest in the thin , delectable line between pleasure and pain .According to the study , which surveyed a wide swath of citizens who have been very , very bad , 78 percent of all U . S . nipples are not being pinched , tweaked , or otherwise constricted in a severe enough manner . In addition , the study found that nearly 90 percent of all Americans are not currently down on their hands and knees , begging for more ." The vast majority of U . S . citizens are just not receiving the physical punishment they deserve , " said Masochism Bureau director Geoff Knowlton , who was permitted by his mistress , Alexandria , to meet with reporters despite being unfit for anything but groveling at her boot heels . " Unless something is done whether with a riding crop , a stiff wooden paddle , or a series of humiliating commands to bark like a dog this problem will only get worse . "" We are sniveling , spineless scum , " Knowlton continued . " And it ' s time we were taught a lesson . "Though disconcerting to many , the Masochism Bureau ' s findings regarding nipple abuse were not unexpected . Hooded sources confirmed the cruelty of erotically charged acts has dropped sharply in the past decade , which has also seen declines in the overall use of bondage gear , the tightness of leather harnesses , and the number of instances of naked , dominated citizens screaming out in delight while being flogged repeatedly against the hindquarters .The use of hot , ripe eggplants has also reportedly fallen off ." Most Americans we spoke to indicated that they had never engaged in any form of formalized nipple torture , " said Masochism Bureau researcher Brian Henley . " Furthermore , only 3 percent of citizens indicated that they were likely to dangle heavy weights from their outstretched areolas while being ordered to crawl inside of a small metal cage . "Added Henley , " I ' m sorry , but that ' s just a frightening statistic . "Despite the pessimistic conclusions of the study , researchers said that robust nipple clamping and flagellation were still occurring in small pockets across the country , giving them hope that there could be a national masochism resurgence someday ." For whatever reason , certain regions have bucked the trend , " Knowlton said . " If we can figure out why a suburb like Coral Springs , FL , with its predominantly elderly and conservative population , has actually seen its rate of urolagnia and other water sports increase , we could potentially use that information to stage a turnaround . "Many have praised the study as an urgently needed wake up call , saying they hope it will encourage more direct government involvement in the public ' s eroticized pain needs ." With any luck , this study is just the beginning , " Topeka , KS submissive Glenn Lange said . " Unless we want to live in a nation where you ' ll only find nipple vices or welting rods in a museum , the government needs to step up . "However , citizens like Nathan Cardozzi of Boston disagreed , claiming that increased government regulation would only stymie what has always been a private act of exquisite torture between two or more consenting adults ." Mmmph mmmph mrrrr mmmmph , " Cardozzi said through the ball gag he was forced to wear to plug his filthy voice hole . " Mmmmrh mrrrhhhhh mmmph mummm . "" Mmmrphmphmmhmmmrh , " he added , slowly shaking his head .The Bureau of Masochism study offered several recommendations aimed at reversing the downward trend in nipple clamping , all of which were redacted by their superiors at the Department of Sadism , who ordered them to shut up at once and get back to licking the floors clean . 	 1
US to ramp up its military presence in South KoreaSouth Korean protesters burn an effigy of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un during a anti North Korea rally in Seoul yesterday . Photo : GettySeoul and Washington have discussed the deployment of US strategic military assets to the Korean peninsula , according to a South Korean military official , after North Korea detonated what it claims was a hydrogen bomb .The two governments have declined to provide details of what those assets might be , but analysts suggest they could include the deployment of the THAAD anti ballistic missile system in South Korea and an increased presence by the US 7th Fleet in waters off the east coast of the peninsula .In early 2013 , another period of escalated tensions in the region , the US sent a nuclear submarine to the region and carried out sorties of nuclear capable B 2 and B 52 bombers in South Korean airspace . A similar show of force is very possible , the experts suggest .Pyongyang ' s latest act of belligerence may even prompt new discussions on the reintroduction of US tactical nuclear weapons into the South . The last such weapons were withdrawn in the early 1990s , although South Korea remains firmly under Washington ' s nuclear umbrella .Both governments remain reluctant to push ahead with the reintroduction of US nuclear weapons to the peninsula , but there are some in the South who insist they should remain an option ." The US and South Korea are being intentionally vague on their possible reactions , but it is likely that they are considering exo atmospheric interceptors , " Lance Gatling , a defence analyst and president of Nexial Research Inc , said . " They are involved in a strategic and diplomatic tit for tat at the moment , with the North ' s nuclear test raising the technical and threat levels , meaning the South and the US have to respond by raising their defence levels . "North Korea took the world by surprise when it announced on Wednesday that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb . Although most analysts doubt the claim , and seismic data suggests it was more likely to have been a less powerful atomic bomb of the sort it has detonated three times before , the test provoked a wave of international condemnation .Han Min koo , the South Korean defence minister , said the military was exploring possible responses to the latest North Korean provocation , including resuming propaganda broadcasts through loudspeakers across the Demilitarised Zone that divides the two nations .Similar broadcasts triggered a brief exchange of artillery fire in August of last year .Washington has reiterated its " ironclad defence commitment " to South Korea during a telephone discussion between Mr Han and Ashton Carter , the US defence secretary , with Yonhap News reporting that the agreement " includes all kinds of extended deterrence assets " .John Kerry , the US secretary of state , confirmed Washington ' s position that the test was a " highly provocative act " and an unacceptable challenge to the international community , as well as a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea for its nuclear and missile programmes .President Barack Obama also held talks with Shinzo Abe , the Japanese prime minister , in which he reaffirmed the US commitment to Japan ' s security . The two leaders agreed to " work together to forge a united and strong international response to North Korea ' s reckless behaviour " , the White House said .Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .

NEW YORK CITY Well it appears that the prima donna diva who likes to brag about belittling , berating , and hitting her employees may find herself on the way to the " Big House " ( Prison ) .Naomi " The Bitch From Hell " Campbell is finally getting a taste of how it feels to be mistreated .One of her former maids , Elvira Sue Franklin , 49 , recalls how three years ago , she prepared Campbell ' s favorite food Fried Chicken Wings smothered in Watermelon Juice .Well it seems that Naomi happened to find a little white watermelon seed in the juice . And instead of merely picking it out and going on with her food chompin ' the singing skank called Elvira over to the table and she made her remove the seed with a pair of tweezers .After she did Campbell took the tweezers and pulled out three of Elvira ' s nostril hairs . Miss Franklin said that she quit right then and there .When she got home she told her boyfriend Rufus Tyrone McJefferson , 37 , who wanted to go over to Campbell ' s house and beat out of the sick bitch with one Elvira ' s Nike tennis shoes .And so as the saying goes , what goes around comes around . Campbell is now whining and crying and saying that she had no idea that it was illegal to take uncut diamonds out of South Africa .Her attorney Algonquin P . Butterflucker says that Campbell will plead ignorance of the law . Butterflucker is not stupid , although he certainly gives off that appearance , and he knows full well that ignorance of the law is no excuse , not even with someone like Naomi " The Mean Fiend " Campbell .Campbell told a reporter for Fox News that she cannot go to prison because she has already scheduled a 92 city concert tour of the south starting in September and running through December .Naomi is not really considered a singer per se and she was asked why she would book a 92 city concert tour when she doesn ' t even sing . Naomi said that she did not have to answer any questions since she is not a criminal .EDITOR ' S NOTE : Well I for one hope that the fat assed arrogant ho goes to prison . She has treated her employees much worse than any Civil War plantation overseer ever did . She is nothing more than a spoiled diva with a piss poor English accent . And it will be interesting to see if Lady Campbell treats her fellow female inmates , who will probably average 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh around 305 pounds , the way she treated her employees . I think not .EDITOR ' S NOTE 2 : It is a fact ( in my opinion ) that Naomi Campbell along with Ann " Trigger Face " Coulter , Nancy " Graceless " Grace , and Joan " The Jewish Douche Bag " Rivers are four of the most hated women in the entire United States . 	 1
RALEIGH , NC At approximately 2 : 30 p . m . EDT Wednesday in the offices of Emery Lane Advertising at 129 Bronson Avenue , Ron Meyer , 34 , announced that he was in need of a rubber band .Meyer , a market researcher at the ad agency , reportedly informed his colleagues that he needed to keep a 22 inch by 28 inch piece of white poster board in a rolled up position , and stated that a rubber band would be the best clasping tool for the job ." I ' d use tape , but sometimes when you take it off it scuffs up the paper , " Meyer said .He followed his brief announcement with a 10 minute search for a single loop of sulfur vulcanized rubber . Office sources confirmed that Meyer initiated the search by looking through his middle desk drawer and after failing there proceeded to question his coworkers as to whether or not they possessed , or had recently seen , a rubber band .Though Meyer indicated to colleagues that he had no preference as to the rubber band ' s color or thickness , his standards for the rubber band ' s length were much more stringent . According to fellow market researcher Geoff Freedman , 32 , Meyer was offered a " smaller than normal " sized rubber band by coworker Margaret Cliere , who was evidenty unaware of the circumference and diameter of the rolled up poster board . Meyer , Freedman said , rejected the rubber band , saying it would not be able to withstand the stretching necessary to fit around the previously mentioned tube of paper .Meyer then conducted a sweep of the office ' s supply closet , starting with a small , plastic container labeled " rubber bands , " before checking the binder clasp and paper clip compartments " just in case . "The search was unsuccessful .The rubber band was patented in England by British businessman and inventor Stephen Perry in 1845 . It is also referred to as a gum band , lackey band , or elastic band . According to production reports from the United States Rubber Company , some 2 . 3 billion of the commonly used fastening tools are produced each month , making Meyer ' s inability to locate one all the more distressing ." I can ' t believe nobody has a rubber band , " Meyer said .According to office manager Jessica Terry , 28 , the rubber band shortage was likely the result of a company wide mailing that went out on Monday , in which multiple rubber bands were employed . Following the use of her own last personal rubber bands and two from a coffee mug at reception , Terry placed an order for more rubber bands from the advertising company ' s main office supply provider , Staples . The shipment is expected to arrive Friday , however two full days after Meyer ' s initial request ." There ' s got to be a rubber band around here somewhere , " said Meyer , who was seen by several eyewitnesses keeping his poster board rolled up using only his bare hands . " I could have sworn someone at this office had one of those big balls of rubber bands , but maybe I saw that somewhere else . "This isn ' t the first time Meyer has needed a rubber band . In 2005 , Meyer used the pliable binding device to hold together a group of same inked pens . Also , during the second semester of his freshman year at Wake Forest University , Meyer was able to bind a pack of cards with a large rubber elastic by wrapping the band around twice to give it the necessary tautness . And records indicate that on Mar . 15 , 1984 , a 10 year old Meyer learned how to tie a rubber band around his gun shaped hand and shoot it at his younger sister , Audrey Meyer , 7 .In all three instances , Meyer claimed he was able to locate the rubber bands with ease .Said Meyer : " I usually just find them in a drawer . "At press time , Meyer stated that he just remembered coworker Jaime Spanish , 37 , sometimes wears a hair tie . 	 1

" syrian state run media, meanwhile, said sunday that regime forces had killed numerous " terrorists " in aleppo and freed 30 people who had been " kidnapped by the armed terrorist groups. " heart rending choices in warzone hospitalfor over a year, the syrian government has refused to acknowledge the popular uprising against president bashar al assad's rule and has blamed " armed terrorist groups " for fueling the bloodshed. meanwhile, 27 civilians were killed and another 64 wounded in a car bombing near two hospitals in western aleppo, the state run sana news agency reported, citing aleppo's gov. mohammed wahid. this blast significantly damaged the two hospitals, a school and other buildings. the syrian observatory for human rights confirmed that 27 people had died in the attack around what is known as the earth area of aleppo. it was not immediately clear, the opposition group said, whether those killed were civilians or regime forces. the violence was hardly confined to aleppo, however. across the country, at least 160 people were killed sunday, opposition activists said. a quarter of those deaths were in and around the syrian capital, as well as 22 in daraa and 22 in homs nine of them killed in a " massacre " in rastan, according to the lcc. the opposition group reported sunday evening that 19 people on one damascus street died " after a mortar shell landed on homes in the area. " citing a source, state media reported 14 " terrorists " were killed in a clash with regime forces in the al qusayr countryside. both sana and the lcc, on its facebook page, identified the same three men as being killed in the area with the opposition group saying they died after " a land mine planted by regime forces in a road exploded.

" unrwa deplores the tragic loss of life and expresses the view that threats to ( palestinian ) refugees and other civilians can be avoided. all sides must refrain from conducting the conflict in civilian areas and must comply with their obligations under international law, " the statement said. diplomatic front : new envoy to syria to work with arab leadersinternational envoy lakhdar brahimi arrived in cairo on sunday to meet with arab league officials on the syrian crisis, egyptian state media reported. this is brahimi's first such meeting since becoming the u. n. arab league special envoy to syria. he faces the daunting task of trying to help stop the bloodshed in the war torn country. while in egypt, brahimi will meet with egyptian president mohamed morsy, arab league secretary general nabil el araby and several syrian opposition figures to talk about the syrian crisis, his spokesman ahmed fawzi told egypt's state run mena news agency. british foreign secretary william hague will arrive in cairo on monday night for a two day visit focused on syria, the palestinian israeli issue and economic matters, according to mena. a family's desperate storyafter spending a few days in egypt, brahimi has said he will head next to damascus. iran's deputy foreign minister abbas eraqij told his nation 	 0
Flash floods have inundated refugee camps in northern Sri Lanka , endangering more than 16 , 000 Tamil refugees who only months ago survived cross fire in the country ' s two decade civil war , the United Nations says .In this file photo Tamil civilians are seen at Menik Farm refugee camp on the outskirts of Vavuniya , Sri Lanka .Three days of heavy rains have damaged or destroyed nearly 2 , 000 shelters housing the refugees in the Vavuniya District and in Menik Farm , according to the U . N . Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ." Due to heavy showers on 14 August 09 . . . many tents and toilets were submerged badly damaged , " the memo said ." Reportedly more than 300 families gathered together and marched towards the main access gate of the Zone to protest , " the memo continued . " Though . . . not violent , they seemed disgruntled and agitated due to the sufferings and expressed their resentment by hooting and making noises . "The camps spread across northern Sri Lanka are home to about 280 , 000 people , who were displaced in the final months of the nation ' s civil war .The flooding came ahead of Sri Lanka ' s monsoon season , which typically brings heavy rains to the country ' s northeast from October till January ." If the rain continues , which is very likely , then the overall situation may go out of control of the management and lead to serious security threat , " the memo warned , saying contingency plans are being " discussed and worked out . "Human Rights Watch has called for the immediate release of Tamil civilians living in the camps , which are surrounded by barbed wire , saying they are being confined against their will , like criminals ." Those are not detention camps , " Lakshman Hulugalle , a Defense Ministry spokesman , said in late July . " They are relief villages . All the basic facilities are being given to the people . "Hulugalle said that barbed wire is commonly used to define barriers in Sri Lanka and that military guards were being used out of security concerns . The government fears that rebels are hiding in the camps and is screening people living in them .Sri Lanka declared victory in May in its 25 year battle with the Tamil Tiger rebels , but concerns remain about how the island nation can heal its deep war wounds .The rebels formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had waged war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983 . As many as 70 , 000 people were killed in the conflict .Last month the government said it had a 18 day plan to resettle most of the refugees , but added that a lot of work remains to be done to infrastructure and basic services destroyed in the fighting .Human rights activists say , however , that the government is not working fast enough .Human Rights Watch said Sri Lanka ' s goal now was to resettle only 60 percent of the refugees by year ' s end . 	 0

An American aid worker and her Afghan driver who were kidnapped in Afghanistan a month ago are feared dead , according to their aid group .Cyd Mizell had been working on projects designed to help women and families generate income .Meanwhile , two Polish soldiers in the NATO led force in Afghanistan were killed and one was injured by a roadside bomb , a military said Wednesday .Armed gunmen snatched Cyd Mizell and her driver , Muhammad Hadi , from a residential neighborhood in the southern Kandahar province on January 26 .In a statement on its Web site , Mizell ' s organization the Asian Rural Life Foundation said it was " deeply grieved to report the apparent deaths . "" Although we have no confirmation of their deaths , we have received information over the past few days indicating that our two aid workers have been killed , " the statement said .The statement did not say what led the organization to believe that its employees had died ." We are trying to make sure whether it is true or not , " said Zemarai Bashary . " We cannot confirm the death yet because our police do not have any reports regarding that she was killed . "The organization runs several projects in the Kandahar area , and also has a presence in about 12 other Asian countries .Mizell traveled around Kandahar in a burqa the traditional attire of some Afghan women that covers them from head to toe .At the time of her abduction , Mizell had been working on projects designed to help women and families generate income . She also taught English at a high school and embroidery lessons at a girl ' s school , the organization said .Rodgers said he had known Mizell for almost two decades .The driver who was kidnapped , Hadi , has been with the organization for two years . He is the father of five children , all under 15 .Soon after the abductions , some 500 to 600 Afghan women gathered at a wedding hall in Kandahar and implored government officials to find Mizell ' s captors .No group has taken responsibility for the abductions .Early this month , Mizell ' s father , George , issued an appeal to her kidnappers , pleading for his daughter ' s release in a statement ." I ' m confused why my daughter would be taken because she ' s a gentle , caring , and respectful person , " he said . " When we talk to Cyd , she tells us about the friends she ' s made and the kindness that ' s been shown to her and of her desire to help them . "While a spate of kidnappings have gripped Afghanistan recently including the abduction of 23 South Korean Christian aid workers and a German woman last year it was the first such abduction for the foundation .Two NATO soldiers killedThe deadly roadside bombing took place Tuesday in the Sharan district of Paktika province , along the rugged border with Pakistan .The wounded soldier is being treated at an ISAF medical facility . ISAF , or the International Security Assistance Force , is the NATO led military force in Afghanistan ." Our hearts and minds are with the family and other loved ones of the brave soldiers who died on patrol , " said Brig . Gen . Carlos Branco , an ISAF spokesperson . " These soldiers died honorably , helping bring security to Afghanistan . "Since the conflict began in late 2001 , three Polish troops have died in Afghanistan .The bombing came as a prominent American politician said that the war in Iraq is distracting the United States from what ' s happening along the Afghanistan Pakistan border .Sen . Joe Biden , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee , on Tuesday called the border region " the most urgent need in the war on terror " and " a superhighway for extremists . "The senator from Delaware just returned from Pakistan , where he and Sens . John Kerry , D Massachusetts , and Chuck Hagel , R Nebraska , observed the election and also traveled in Afghanistan , India and Turkey ." The main message I bring back is that Afghanistan is the forgotten war and Pakistan is the neglected frontier , " Biden said at a Capitol Hill news conference . " Afghanistan is slipping toward failure because it has never been a priority , and it has to become one . " E mail to a friend 	 0
BOSTON Unable to recall a single instance in which their father mentioned any details about his early adulthood , the children of local man Alan Murphy confirmed Monday they had no idea what he was doing between the years of 1985 and 1988 .During a conversation between siblings Sarah , Mark , and Jess Murphy , all now in their 20s , it reportedly became apparent that none of them had ever known their dad to discuss any jobs , friends , living arrangements , cars , or personal interests he might have had in the years between graduating from the University of California , Davis , in 1985 and meeting their mother in Boston in the fall of 1988 ." Yeah , come to think of it , I don ' t think I ' ve even heard him tell one story about that time in his life , " said Jess Murphy , who acknowledged it hadn ' t occurred to her until just now that the nearly four year period of her father ' s life was an absolute mystery to her . " It ' s strange , because he talks about his childhood friends , his college friends , and the friends he and Mom have had over the years , but I can ' t remember him ever mentioning anyone from that period . You know , I ' ve never seen any photos from back then , either . "" I don ' t think he went to grad school , " she continued . " That seems like something we ' d know about , right ?The siblings agreed that their father must have been doing something to earn a living during the latter half of the 1980s , but each of them failed to recall even an offhand mention of a particular workplace , any colleagues , or even a line of work he might have been engaged in at the time . While Sarah Murphy remarked that their dad " might have just been waiting tables and stuff like that during the 1985 1988 period , she and her siblings conceded it would be kind of strange for him not to have mentioned it , considering all the anecdotes he had told them about the paper route he had as a boy , the movie theater where he worked in high school , and even his work study job at his college library ." I know that on his 21st birthday , he and some buddies took a road trip to Tahoe and went skiing , so maybe he just bummed around there for a while ? said Mark Murphy , recalling how his father was fond of repeating that particular story . " Wait , no he was born in ' 63 , so I guess that trip must have happened in 1984 , which means he still had a whole year of school left . I guess he could have stuck around Davis for a bit after graduation , but it doesn ' t sound like the kind of place you ' d stick around in at that age . It ' s just weird how the next thing I know about him is that he started dating Mom four years later in Boston . "" Wait , why did he move all the way here in the first place ? Mark continued . " You ' d think there would have to be some reason . "The siblings reportedly spent several minutes deep in thought , scouring their memories of long ago dinner table conversations , stray comments , and funny stories they overheard their father telling his friends in hopes he may have divulged information about the gap in his life . Sarah Murphy is then said to have told her brother and sister she recalled having once seen , in the attic of their parents ' house , a helmet that appeared to be for a motorcycle rider , which they all acknowledged as odd , considering they had never known their father to ride motorcycles or ever mention any fondness for them in particular , ultimately leading them to question whether the helmet provided a clue to their father ' s missing years at all or if it had somehow come into the family ' s possession through happenstance .Each of the Murphy children reportedly concurred that they had heard their father mention how he hitchhiked one time , though none could state whether such an incident occurred during the four year window in question , while further acknowledging that if it did , such an episode posed far more questions than it answered ." I remember this one time , Dad took me to a Celtics game , and I asked him what it was like living in the city back when they won the championship in 1986 , " said Mark Murphy , adding that he had just assumed his father would fondly recall watching the NBA Finals or attending the ensuing victory parade . " But he just told me that he wasn ' t living in Boston yet and left it at that . He didn ' t say anything else and went back to watching the game . "" Huh , " he added .When the three siblings later asked their mother if she knew anything about their father ' s activities from 1985 to 1988 , she reportedly changed the subject to ask about their plans for Thanksgiving this year . 	 1
sparta, tn a pair of mattel barbie and ken dolls reenacted a fight between the parents of amanda lytle, 6, in the girl's bedroom monday. " where were you so late last night? " pop sensation barbie asked ken at approximately 7 p. m., just after bath time. " what time did you get home? it was way past your bedtime when you got in. " angrily bobbing across lytle's bedspread to the pillow against which ken lounged, barbie raised her arm parallel to the floor and menacingly leaned toward ken. " i suppose you were down at that bar again with your dumb friends, weren't you? " barbie said. " why don't you call me when you're going to be late? don't you think i worry? " " if you know where i am, why do you need me to call? " responded palm beach ken, dressed in a pair of velcro closed pants and a blue stretch pullover emblazoned with his name. " besides, i only go to the bar because people are nice to me there instead of being mean and picking on me like you do. " lytle stared thoughtfully at the dolls before picking up barbie, who raised her arm again and spoke. " if the policeman stops you, he's going to give you a ticket, and then you will be sorry, " barbie said. " the last time you got one, it was for 4. we don't have money to give to the policeman. you were naughty. " while barbie changed shoes, lytle explained the conflict between the dolls to a row of beanie babies seated nearby. " barbie is mad at ken because he said he was coming home after work, but then he didn't, " lytle said. " but ken said he had to work late, so he should be able to go where he wants. and he didn't want to call because barbie always gets mad at him and yells when he calls, so he doesn't call. but that makes barbie maaaad. she's going to the kitchen. " " slam, slam, slam! " said barbie, facing the wall. " i'm making dinner. " rising from his seated position, still bent at the waist, ken bobbed over to an empty hostess twinkies box on the floor next to the bed and climbed inside. " i'm going to circus city, " said ken, revving the twinkies box's engine. " that's the place with all the tvs for sale where we went that time uncle dale needed to get batteries for his camera. " " go ahead, " barbie said. " see you in five hours. have a nice time at the bar. " " what is that supposed to mean? " ken asked. " i said i was going to go to circus city in my car. you've been yelling at me all week to get a new plug for the toaster. now i go, and you are yelling at me. " " fine, just don't buy anything else, " barbie said. " we don't have any money because you drink all the money. " added barbie : " we should get our daughter lots of nice presents and throw her a birthday party and get her a bike and a cat instead. " throwing herself forward into a horizontal position on the bed, barbie cried loudly. " do you love me anymore? " barbie asked. " boo hoo hoo. if you don't love me anymore, tell me. " " vroom, vroom, vroom, " said ken, zooming the twinkies box across the room to the dresser. " i have to get out of this nuthouse. i am going crazy. i'm going to go to circus city to get the new plug for the toaster. " ken then drove off to circus city, located on lytle's dresser. after walking around the surface of the dresser several times, ken climbed back into the hostess box and returned home to find barbie hiding under the pillow. " knock, knock, knock, " said ken, rapping his open palm on the pillow. " i'm home from circus city. i got the plug, and i got a movie on dvd. i got it because i know you wanted to see it. come out, and we will make some microwave popcorn, and we can watch the movie on the couch. it's a movie with kissing in it. " after nearly 10 seconds of silence, barbie emerged from beneath the pillow. " i told you not to buy anything, " barbie said. " we don't have any money. " " i got it for you, " ken said. " it's a movie for us to play. we can 	 1
In this Feb . 23 , 2013 , photograph provided by the U . S . Navy , sailors assigned to Riverine Squadron ( RIVRON ) 2 perform an E stop while conducting patrol operations . Iran held 10 U . S . Navy sailors and their two boats , similar to the one in this picture .Kerry thanks Iranians for cooperation and quick response 'Iran released 10 U . S . sailors it had detained after their boats strayed into Iranian waters , easing frictions that have intensified ahead of the implementation of the July nuclear accord .After it was made clear that the U . S . boats had unintentionally entered into the Islamic Republic s waters and they apologized , the decision to free them was taken , the country s Revolutionary Guards said on Wednesday in a statement carried by the Tasnim news agency .The U . S . Defense Department said the sailors had departed Iran aboard the two Riverine Command Boats they had been operating when they lost contact with the Navy . There are no indications that the sailors were harmed during their brief detention , it said in a statement . Defense Secretary Ashton Carter later confirmed that the sailors are now back in U . S . hands .Tuesday s incident added a new bump to U . S . Iranian relations as Iran moves closer perhapswithin days to winning a lifting of international sanctions against it in return for curbing its nuclear activities . Pressure has grown in the U . S . Congress to impose additional sanctions on Iran for its recent ballistic missile tests .The sailors detention was reported just hours before U . S . President Barack Obama was set to deliver his final State of the Union address . Republicans were quick to say , as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it , that it showed the Iranians were on the prowl and President Obama isn t very well respected .The administration said the outcome demonstrated the opposite : the benefits of engagement with Iran through the talks that yielded the nuclear deal . Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , who came to know each other well during the months of negotiations , spoke by phone Tuesday while the sailors were being held . Kerry said Wednesday that he wanted to thank the Iranian authorities for their cooperation and quick response .These are always situations which , as everybody here knows , have the ability if not properly guided to get out of control , Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington . And I think we can all imagine how a similar situation might have played out three or four years ago .The U . S . naval craft entered Iranian territorial waters at 4 : 30 p . m . on Tuesday , the Guards said in a statement on their news website , Sepahnews . ir . The nine men and one woman were taken to nearby Farsi Island , according to an initial statement published Wednesday .Guards navy commander Admiral Ali Fadavi said Wednesday that investigations showed the U . S . naval craft entered Iranian territorial waters due to a broken navigation system , according to a Tasnim report . A U . S . defense official , who asked not to be identified discussing the incident , said an investigation will begin to determine what led to the incident .Video released by Iran s Fars News Agency shows the captured American sailors being forced to kneel with their hands behind their heads and displays weapons arrayed on the decks of one of the ships . Later , though , the video shows the Americans chatting as they were served an Iranian meal .Riverine command boats are light weight , high speed , coastal assault vessels that conduct maritime security operations , protect infrastructure and provide security escorts .In 2007 , Iran seized 15 British sailors and marines who the U . K . said were conducting routine boarding operations in Iraqi waters and Iranians said had illegally crossed into its maritime zone . They were released after 13 days . 	 0
google unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin. now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will'automatically modify or destroy targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect '. according to the files, the wearable could target these cells using an'external energy source'such as ultrasound or radio frequencies. google's patent explained its wearable ( illustrated ) could target any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. this could include infrared signals, a radio frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field'a number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes chemicals in a person's blood,'explained the nanoparticle phoresis patent.'analytes could... be indicative of a medical condition or health of the person'and could include'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.'google continued that its wearable would target any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. in an interview with bloomberg, google ventures'president bill maris recently said he thinks it's possible to live to 500 years old. and this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics. he has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said :'we have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision. i just hope to live long enough not to die.'mr maris founded google ventures in 2009 and oversees all of the fund's global activities. elsewhere he has develop google's calico project. calico is a research and development company set up in 2013 by google and apple to tackle'ageing and associated diseases.'google co founder larry page said the project would focus on'health, wellbeing and longevity'and last september calico partnered with abbvie to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer. this could include infrared signals, a radio frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field. the energy used would depend on what the band is targeting, but it would be designed to alter the chemical composition of the analyte.'in one relevant example, certain proteins have been implicated as a partial cause of parkinson's disease the development of parkinson's disease may be prevented or retarded by providing particles functionalized with a bioreceptor that will selectively bind to this target'continued the files.'these bound particles may then be used, in combination with a wearable device as described above, to modify or destroy the target protein.'as a further example, the target could be cancer cells by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells, the spread of cancer may be diminished.'in january, andrew conrad, head of google life sciences unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells. after travelling around the body, these nanoparticles would then be collected, using a magnet, to reveal what cells they encountered. the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, for example, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body. the system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles, so scientists must understand how light passes through skin. so google started making skin. it would scan the blood for so called analytes, or chemicals, in the blood such as the presence of'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.'google said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of parkinson's disease, for example, or cancer cellsin january, google's life sciences lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells. to assist with their research, the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors ( pictured ) to assist with their research, the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors. as the wearable is still in the early stages of development, google x is working to determine what defines a'healthy'person. they are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information. mr conrad admitted that people may find it'weird'having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body. after travelling around the body, these nanoparticles would then be collected, using a magnet, to reveal what cells they encountered. the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, for example 	 0
Phil Jones played as a deep lying midfielder , but it didn ' t feel like a midfielder ' s performance .He was embarrassed by Giorgio Chiellini for their goal , and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set piece .When England were in possession , he didn ' t work hard enough to get on the ball he was happy to let Chris Smalling bring the ball out .Manchester United defender Phil Jones failed to impress after being handed a midfield roleJones ( right ) returns to the centre circle after playing a part in conceding Italy ' s opening goalRoy Hodgson ' s ' experiment ' of playing Jones as a deep central midfielder didn ' t pay dividendsRead Martin Samuel ' s full match report from the Juventus StadiumOut of possession , he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger . This is fine when he wins the ball , but a very risky tactic .In fairness , he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly , which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing .The main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he can ' t win it . He looks like he ' s been fired out of a cannon ! He ' ll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four .Sir Alex Ferguson famously labelled Jones the next Duncan Edwards , but he didn ' t look very Edwards like . At 23 , it feels like we ' re still trying to figure out his best position .He is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically proficient player like Andrea Pirlo .Wayne Rooney looked excellent against Italy , like the elder statesman leading his younger team mates .He does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30 yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar .Wayne Rooney stepped to the fore in his role as captain and was unlucky not to score in TurinEngland captain showed a good understanding with Harry Kane on their first start togetherHe also linked up really well with Harry Kane , especially in the second half .

Washington Ibrahim Hooper knows the drill .When news first broke Thursday that a shooting at Fort Hood , Texas , killed and injured U . S . soldiers , the national communications director for the Council on American Islamic Relations wrote a statement of condemnation .He only sent it out later , when reports emerged that the alleged shooter ' s name was Maj . Nidal Malik Hasan ." As soon as we saw what appeared to be a Muslim name , we issued our statement , " Hooper said . " Until that time , we were praying that no Muslim would be involved . "That ' s the reality of crisis management for the Muslim American community , said Hooper , who handles communications for the nation ' s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group .Even without confirmation that the alleged gunman was Muslim there was no immediate determination of any religious affiliation for Hasan the mere reporting of a possible Muslim name required an immediate comment , he said ." That ' s unfortunately the world we live in nowadays , " Hooper said . " So often , Muslims are accused of not condemning these kind of acts . "The CAIR statement said : " No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence . The attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all volunteer Army that protects our nation . American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured . "In a separate statement , the Muslim Public Affairs Council , based in Los Angeles , California , condemned what it called the " heinous incident . "" We are in contact with law enforcement and U . S . federal government officials to gain more facts from this tragic incident and work together in dealing with its aftermath , " the group said .Its statement called on " all members of American Muslim communities to be in contact with local law enforcement for the safety and security of their communities and their institutions . "The Islamic Information Center also issued a statement " in conjunction with all the major Muslim organizations nationwide " that condemned the attack ." While several news reports have cited one of the gunmen to be Army Maj . Nidal Malik Hasan , IIC strongly emphasizes that this attack and its perpetrator are in no way representative of the Muslim people or the peace loving religion of Islam , " the statement said ." The individuals who perpetrated this attack blatantly acted against the teachings of Islam and humanity , " it added .After the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States , Muslim Americans reported increased attacks and threats by revenge minded non Muslims ." We ' ve seen this before , " Hooper said of a possible backlash . " Whenever there ' s an incident of this type , there ' s always the possibility this will happen . "Even non Muslims could be targeted , he said , noting that Sikhs who wear turbans or Hispanic Americans can be mistaken as being of Middle Eastern descent .On Thursday night , CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad told a news conference the alleged Fort Hood attacker ' s motive remained unknown ." We urge all Americans to remain calm in reaction to this tragic event and to demonstrate once again what is best about America our nation ' s ability to remain unified even in times of crisis , " Awad said . " We urge national political and religious leaders and media professionals to set a tone of calm and unity ." Unfortunately , based on past experience , we also urge American Muslims , and those who may be perceived to be Muslim , to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves , their families and their religious institutions from possible backlash .

Former Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro is under attack from members of a political entity known as the " Obama Concept " over comments she recently made while campaigning for Hillary Clinton .Ferraro said , " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position . And if he was a woman , he would not be in this position . He happens to be very lucky to be who he is . And the country is caught up in the concept "The Obama Concept fired back at Ferraro by labeling her comments divisive and absurd . There are several other items found to be divisive and absurd by the Obama Concept :The Obama Concept is careful to point out that any negative reference to the Concept is to be considered divisive and absurd . As Obama himself puts it :" We are about the warmth of unity and not the frightful , frozen land of division . We bring the abundance of hope to the starvation of despair . We say , where there is the pain of discomfort , we bring the vision of pleasure . We must be ready .There are those who say we are only about the scent of flowery rhetoric . But these are the naysayers of the past , and those who would divide us with dusty , murky imagery . We say , let those ancient minds remain stagnant . They are not ready .The Obama future holds many ways for us to embrace change and enhance hope . We must first consider the object of change and how that change object folds itself around the vehicle of hope . Only when the two are together , in unity and without the divide of outmoded politics , will we be ready for tomorrow ' s change of audacious hope .My detractors ask me about the audacity of my new hope . They say my bold hope is not especially real because it uses only words without cemented meanings . But they would steal nourishing hope from the minds and mouths of our children . My detractors are the thieves of my universally inclusive hope . To keep the hope thieves at bay , it needs a home and where does hope find a home ? I can tell you where hope resides it resides here next to my change garden . I am the exclusive agent of hope and change . I am the farmer of goodness . Everything speaks through me . Any supporter of me is a supporter of goodness , hope , fairness , change , abundance , happiness , virtue , progress and the condition of being glad . Are you ready ? If not , you are divisive and absurd . " 	 1
As the refereeing fraternity comes under increasing pressure , Sportsmail reveals the shocking disparity between the wages earned by Premier League officials and those who work more in the Football League .Select Group referees operating mostly in the Premier League are believed to earn a basic salary of around 65 , 000 per year , while they also receive fees in excess of 1 , 000 per game in the top flight . If they were to officiate 38 games in a season , it would bring their overall pay to more than 100 , 000 .Referees on the National Group operating in the Football League are not on contracts and are paid in the region of 380 a match . They sign up to the National Group on the equivalent of a freelance basis . If they were to officiate the 46 games in a Football League season , they would receive 17 , 480 .Top Premier League referees like Phil Dowd ( centre ) can earn up to 100 , 000 per year in wagesReferees lower down the football food chain earn far less , with potential earnings of around 17 , 000 per yearAssistant referees on the National List are paid as little as 185 per match while fourth officials receive 110 . So an assistant referee in the Championship would receive only 8 , 510 for a 46 game season but no retainer in the summer months .In many cases , it will be less because assistant referees are not guaranteed a game in the Football League every week and will also combine fourth official duties and officiating in non League games . One assistant estimated that his yearly earnings would be closer to 5 , 000 .There is also no sliding scale between the Championship and League Two and Sportsmail ' s calculations demonstrate that there could , in theory , be an 80 , 000 gap in pay between refereeing regularly in the Premier League and the Championship .Football League officials tend to work on a freelance basis meaning it is harder to get regular workThe Select Group and National Group fall under the jurisdiction of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited ( PGMOL ) . The organisation declined to comment on the chasm in wages but they take the view that the rates differ between contracted workers and freelance employers as they would in any other industry .It means that most National Group officials have a job and referee as a hobby and one source admitted that there have been occasions when they have seen officials ' extremely tired ' after working a five day week and then refereeing .The Professional Game Match Officials Limited ( PGMOL ) refused to comment on the huge wage disparityThe lower pay in the Football League is thought to be one reason why there are so few good referees coming through the system . It is also hard to dislodge the top flight referees , who are determined to stay where they earn the big money .The Football League say it is an ongoing debate as to whether more officials should be made professional .The wage discrepancy represents a fresh blow to the credibility of the PGMOL after a festive period that saw a litany of errors by Premier League referees . It led Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll to call for the sacking of Mike Riley , the head of the PGMOL .The PGMOL has been under fire from critics following a string of refereeing errors over the festive period 	 0
Only 20 minutes so far ? I can ' t keep sitting on this bike . It hurts . I ' ll just leave class and use the restroom . I don ' t need to go to the bathroom , but it will give my rear end a break . What if everyone stares at me ? Oh no , now my toes are going numb !These thoughts flew through my head during my second spin class a few weeks ago .Recently , our Fit Nation workouts have picked up in intensity . I have tried new activities and pushed myself beyond my physical comfort zone .When this journey began , I envisioned the biggest obstacle to my success would be physical . But after seven weeks of training , I have become acutely aware of the body part that needs the most conditioning . And much to my surprise , it ' s not my abs , triceps or quads . It ' s my mind .I ' ve come to the conclusion that wanting to stop mid workout has little to do with my body and everything to do with my mind . I know many folks who experience negative self talk , where that little voice in your head tells you all the reasons you can ' t do something . My internal dialogue seems to be less focused on telling myself I can ' t do it and more concerned with developing and executing a workout exit strategy .My brain doesn ' t say , " You can ' t . " It says , " You shouldn ' t . "Oh , but I should . And I am . Change your mind , and your body will follow suit . But how do you change your mind ? That ' s the million dollar question .T shirt tales : The athlete I used to beIt turns out some cliches are true . The first step is admitting you have a problem .Hi , my name is Tabitha , and I can talk myself out of a workout before I start . I had a long day at work . It ' s raining . I need to put gas in my car . It ' s Monday . Venus is in retrograde . You get the idea . Excuses and justifications are the path of least resistance .Here are some other cliches that have proved true during my training :Listen to your body , not your head . I ' ve been in the middle of many workouts when I desperately wanted to stop . But when I focused on what I was doing , I could ask myself , " Do I want to stop because I am in pain ? Or am I just uncomfortable because I ' m sweating , breathing hard and making my body stronger ? "If I am honest with myself , the answer every time has been " I ' m just uncomfortable . " And guess what ? I have finished every workout I have started .Get fit and others will followThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself . I recently read the amazing book " Finding Ultra " by Rich Roll . In it he writes , " There ' s only one cure for fear . Faith . " That line resonated with me . It helped me understand that as an adult , fear has prevented me from realizing my full physical potential . In the past , fear is what has stopped me from even trying .So now , if I find myself dragging my heels about a workout , I try to identify the why . Usually , it ' s something silly such as fearing the embarrassment of sharing a lap lane and slowing down another swimmer .Now when I go to pool and find myself in this situation , I simply watch the swimmers for a few minutes . I try to identify someone close to my speed and skill level . I then ask if I can share the lane and tell him or her upfront that I am new to training . This has worked every single time .The real key to overcoming these fears , as Roll pointed out , is faith . Have faith in your journey , in the universe and in yourself .Why being part of a team mattersA picture is worth a thousand words . Everyone , even the toughest endurance athletes , occasionally struggle during workouts . Sometimes the only way I get through particularly tough workouts is visualization .At times , it ' s remembering the two years I spent in nearly constant pain as I battled ulcerative colitis . Compared with that , the aches and weariness of triathlon training pale .More often , I like to visualize my eventual triathlon success . I envision myself crossing the finish line on a warm , breezy day in Malibu , California , this September . I see myself running into the arms of my husband , daughter , parents and sisters . I imagine that magical mixture of physical exhaustion , elation , pride and disbelief that I actually did it . And it keeps me going .Oh , and that spin class ? I did not stop . I finished the class without stopping . And then I ran for 20 minutes afterward .Follow McMahon on Twitter TriHardTabitha . 	 0
BELOW THE BELTWAY , WASHINGTON , D . C . Republicans acted swiftly Tuesday after hearing of the capture of the suspected ringleader of the raid on the U . S . diplomatic post in Benghazi , proposing a measure that would prohibit President Obama from taking any credit for the action and order that the suspect be publicly beheaded with a smiling GOP congressional delegation standing behind him ." That would be a great postcard photo to send to the in laws , " said Sen . John McCain , R Arizona . " Better than that crap they offer at Disney . "He said congressional Republicans have provided a great deal of intelligence assistance in this matter , including calling for U . S . personnel involved in the operation to wear such spy gadgets as shoes with mirrors on them , iron hats and trench coats filled with anti terrorist devices such as squirting ink pens ." Mr Obama got the frequent flyer miles bonus for bin Laden , so this one belongs to us , " said McCain .Ahmed Abu Khatallah was taken into custody in a secret raid in Libya on Sunday . He is now being held in a secure location outside the country , a Pentagon spokesman confirmed .McCain said he hopes for a Fourth of July beheading on the White House lawn , but the GOP doesn ' t want Obama or Democrats any where the event ." They can go hold hands around a campfire and sing Kumbaya , " said McCain . " But for real Americans , let ' s celebrate the old fashioned way like our ancestors with bloodshed . "House Speaker John Boehner , R Ohio , said he has asked the organizers of the annual Nathan ' s hot dog eating contest to relocate it to D . C . , as kind of a warm up act ." Sixty hot dogs going down Joey Chestnut ' s stomach followed by Ahmed Abu Khatallah ' s head coming off , " he said . " I ' ve already got seats reserved for the grandkids . " 	 1
WASHINGTON , DC The recent leak revealing Santa Claus to be " your mommy and daddy " has been linked to President Bush ' s senior political adviser and deputy chief of staff Karl Rove ." If this devastating leak , which severely undermines the security of children everywhere and has compromised parent child relations , came from the highest levels of the White House , that is an outrage , " said former Bush counterterrorism adviser and outspoken Bush Administration critic Richard Clarke .The identity of the mythical holiday gift giver , previously known only in grown up circles , was published in the popular Timbertoes cartoon in the December issue of Highlights For Children . Jean Abrams , a conservative firebrand known to have close ties to Bush appointees in the Department of Education , revealed " Santa " to be a code name for anonymous parental gift giving .Abrams and several other children ' s magazine journalists , including Ranger Rick ' s Kristin Brittany and Cricket managing editor Shaina Belowitz , have testified before a federal grand jury on the source of the leak . Sources say that Randall Polk , Washington bureau chief for Weekly Reader , named Rove after serving eight days in jail for refusing to divulge his sources .Federal investigators began to suspect a White House connection to the Santa leak when Abrams wrote in Timbertoes that the character of Pa had some " devastating information " on " very high authority . "" Did you know that Santa Claus is really just your mommy and daddy ? " Pa ' s dialogue read . " It ' s true . Sometimes parents tell little white lies to their children to make them feel special . "Clarke criticized the leak as " foolhardy , " saying it was " the kind of conduct you would expect from dangerous zealots who routinely confuse short term political gain with the national interest . "" This leak compromises generations of undercover work on the part of U . S . parents , " Clarke said . " Consider all the covers that will be blown , all the secret gift hiding places that will be exposed . "The motivations behind the leak remain unclear , but some political observers have characterized it as a calculated act of retribution against Fairfax , VA second grader Madison Harris . Harris , 7 , wore an antiwar T shirt to her elementary school during a Nov . 2 visit by Education Secretary Margaret Spellings ." The shirt , decorated with doves and the word ' peace , ' angered White House ideologues , who felt that Harris had undermined a tightly orchestrated visit , " independent political media watchdog Ellen Applebee said . " An aggressive attempt to hit Harris where she lived was set in motion . "On Nov . 3 , Rove told reporters , " People shouldn ' t take too seriously the opinions of someone who still thinks a fat man slides down the chimney into her living room every December 25 . " On Nov . 6 , he told several aides , " I don ' t consider it precocious to wear peace T shirts and , from what I hear , read Highlights . "Applebee cited these comments as evidence of " Rove ' s deliberate campaign against Harris . "During that same week , Rove is also believed to have placed calls to several of the children ' s magazine journalists who were later called before the grand jury .If Rove is responsible for leaking Santa ' s identity to the world ' s children , it would not be his first political " dirty trick . " In 1988 , he was fired from George H . W . Bush ' s presidential campaign for sending an unsigned letter to the young daughter of a Dukakis campaign adviser . In the letter , he revealed the sad ending of the film Old Yeller .On Capitol Hill , many say they believe that the damage has already been done . Clarke cited the absence of Santas from several department stores across the country as possible evidence that their compromised identities fatally damaged their credibility ." I don ' t envy parents of young children right now , " Clarke said . " Trust has been shattered . I wouldn ' t be surprised if some moms and dads are forced into hiding . " 	 1
Despite smartphones getting thinner and faster , they still fall foul of bad reception .But a new Reach79 case claims to solve the problem of signal dropping out , by up to doubling a device ' s signal strength .This is possible thanks to a thin gold antenna that is built into the plastic case to provide better coverage , faster data speed and longer battery life , the Californian company claims .No more black spots ! A new case by Reach79 claims to solve the frustrating problem of reception dropping out , by up to doubling a device ' s signal strength . It contains a gold antenna and is currently available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsetsThe iPhone case was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , where its makers claimed it ' s the first one that can optimise a smartphone ' s performance .' Powered by patented antenna technology , Reach79 cases are the first performance enhancing smartphone cases designed for speed , ' said David Vigil , CEO of the Encinitas based firm .' Each case is embedded with a micro thin , gold plated antenna that works to increase your smartphone ' s signal strength so your phone can do more for you . 'A thin gold antenna is sandwiched between two layers of plastic , one with protective rubber cushioning ( pictured ) . The metal shows through the outer plastic layer to make a pattern . The combined antenna system creates superior signal reception , which enables the device to work more efficiently , the company claimsThe antenna inside each case is engineered to automatically join together with an iPhone ' s antennas , through a process called ' passive coupling ' .The idea is that this combined antenna system creates superior signal reception and transmission , which enables the device to work more efficiently .The case costs 60 ( 40 ) for an iPhone 6 and 70 ( 46 ) for an iPhone 6 Plus . More colours and cases for other models are planned to launchThe multiplying effect is intended to work when the phone is held to the ear or in the hand , not when it is left lying on a surface .Tests have shown that the case improves a phone ' s signal strength by an average of 1 . 6 times , doubling it at peak performance .But when Walt Mossberg of Recode tested the case for a week in a variety of locations around Washington DC , he experienced mixed results .' Roughly half the time it seemed to help , sometimes by a little and sometimes by a lot . And roughly half the time it made no difference at all , ' he wrote .' On a few occasions , it actually degraded the performance of my iPhone 6 . 'The company concedes that the case ' s performance depends on the phone , its carrier and location , but that consumers should see benefits including faster data speeds for web browsing and streaming music , for example , and wider coverage for less dropped calls .It also claims that because the smartphone doesn ' t have to work as hard to maintain signal , its battery will last longer .The case , which weighs 1 . 27 ounces ( 36g ) is made from thin plastic with a rubbery cushion around its edges and claims to offer protection against drops up to 6 . 6ft ( two metres ) . Cut way sections expose the gold antenna which is sandwiched between the plastic layers .The case is currently only available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and costs 60 ( 40 ) and 70 ( 46 ) respectively . It comes in black , but more colours will be added this spring as well as cases for other handsets .When the Reach79 case , which contains a gold antenna , is snapped on , the phone and the case are instantly paired together to form a combined antenna system with improved signal strength .The case uses a common antenna engineering trick known as the ' aperture coupled patch ' to transfer energy from the iPhone ' s antenna to connect with the gold plated antenna inside the case .The technique is indirect way of feeding the antenna in the case because there ' s no electrical connection .A ' hole ' in the Reach79 antenna directs energy from the iPhone into the antenna in the case , which is engineered to resonate at mobile phone frequencies , so the coupled energy is re transmitted . 	 0

WASHINGTON The CIA has announced that 231 agents were killed Wednesday during a sensitive and highly overt operation overseas , the deadliest incident to strike the agency ' s Overt Ops program in nearly a month .Speaking in a televised press conference this morning , acting CIA director Michael Morell said the agents were shot dead while attempting to infiltrate the government of Turkmenistan , part of a widely publicized program of U . S . espionage there , the details of which remain unclassified ." Today it is my somber duty to report that 231 heroic Americans have lost their lives in the Overt Ops mission we briefed you on earlier this week , " Morell said of the agents , who reportedly made no attempt to blend into Turkmen society , spoke English openly , and greeted everyone they met on the ground with the words " Hello , do you have any information for me ? " " Their already well known names , faces , and personal histories , which we posted on the CIA ' s website last month , will never be forgotten . "" These brave men and women died as they lived in plain sight , nakedly advancing the intelligence interests of their country without making any effort to conceal their intentions , " Morell added .Multiple CIA press releases indicate the mission , code named Operation Steal Secret Files From Turkmenistan At 9 A . M . March 6th And Then Catch The Next Flight Out Of The Country , involved hundreds of overt operatives pouring into public places all over the country . Once in position , they loudly informed locals that they were CIA agents , asked if any of them happened to be informants , and requested any information anyone might have on where to find the government ' s most sensitive internal documents .Live coverage of the operation carried by cable news networks , the BBC , and Al Jazeera showed Turkmenistan ' s armed forces opening fire on dozens of CIA agents as they stood in city squares shouting anti government slogans through bullhorns and distributing pamphlets critical of the ruling party .The victims , who all wore yellow field jackets with " CIA " printed in large letters on the back , were reportedly identified immediately by the unforged , completely authentic passports they each carried on their person ." It was chaos down there , " Overt Ops chief Stuart P . Braithwaite said today on CBS This Morning . " The gunmen were shouting , ' Who are you ? What is your purpose here ? ' And our agents kept saying , ' We ' re Americans , we ' re trying to undermine your government , we sent you several e mails about this last week , didn ' t you get them ? ' They repeated it in every language spoken in the region , but it ' s as if the Turkmen troops weren ' t even listening . "" We ' re hoping to avoid such miscommunications in the future by providing live updates on our blog and via Twitter , where you can follow us under the handle OvertOpsUSA , " he added .According to federal officials more than willing to speak on the record , agents in the Overt Ops program undergo years of rigorous training , are able to remain highly conspicuous in almost any situation , and can stand out in a crowd with ease .Confiscated from the team ' s hotel rooms following the massacre were detailed topographical maps indicating the location of Turkmenistan ' s extensive natural gas reserves , several hundred kilograms of hard drugs in bundles labeled " For Sowing Chaos in Ahal Province , " and commemorative T shirts printed in anticipation of a successful mission .In a statement issued Wednesday by the White House , President Obama praised the courage and sacrifice of the agents ." The 231 Americans who gave their lives today must never be forgotten , and we must honor them by following the proud example they set , " Obama said . " Indeed , that ' s exactly what we ' ll be doing on Friday when we send Overt Ops to knock on the front door of Bashar al Assad ' s palace in Damascus and ask if anyone inside is interested in helping them orchestrate a coup .

In a leaked document , made public by one of Britain ' s major newspapers earlier this week , it appears that the government , far from abolishing the so called bedroom tax , is getting ready to reintroduce the window tax , last seen in the 18th and 19th centuries .The window tax was originally introduced in England , Wales and Scotland in 1696 , and only repealed in 1851 . It imposed a tax system on houses , according to the number of windows the house had .The leaked document in question allegedly contains a quote , allegedly from British prime minister , David Cameron , which allegedly says in part ( allegedly ) , " What a wonderful way to get rich ! We can tax every window in every house , and that ' s just the start . We can claim that the screen on a mobile phone is a window , not to mention the screens on PCs , laptops , iPads , wristwatches and everything else ." Microwave ovens have screen too , as well as washing machines , dishwashers and other household appliances , and if a computer has Windows installed , we can tax every single program that opens in its own window ! Not to mention that most families have a car with lots of windows too . This tax will just keep on pouring money into our pockets . brilliant ! "The prime minister was not available for comment today , but he was ( allegedly ) spotted in a pub in East Croydon , downing a few pints with the lads , sometimes also known as the cabinet , and grinning from ear to ear .A spokesman for the government is quoted as saying : " This government has developed the fairest system of taxation this country has ever known . The so called bedroom tax makes perfect sense whatever way you look at it . It ensures that people on benefits don ' t have the burden of extra rooms they are not using . After all , they would only have to hoover these extra rooms several times a week , not to mention the dusting and cleaning required . We have removed all that unnecessary work from them and lessened their overall responsibilities . When viewed in this light , only a fool could argue with this tax ." As for the leaked document , I am unable to confirm or deny the possible reintroduction of the window tax . However , I will say that this would also be a very fair tax for a number of reasons that haven ' t been worked out yet . Allegedly . . . " 	 1
Taos , New Mexico In this sleepy town of 5 , 000 potheads , new agers , spics , injuns , liberals and ne ' er do wells , strode in a new Sheriff , this one who bought a run down hotel for 2 million , and thought it was his for having done so .Not so , shrieked the lazy wetbacks there who believed that they were the owners for having listlessly pushed dust rags around for a few years . These south of the border sissies believed that they had the right to do as they pleased , and damn their gringo boss .But they ' d soon learn better from former Marine Whitten ." Don ' t speak Spanish in front of me , I don ' t know what ' blanco maricon grande ' is , but I ' m sure it ' s not good . "" Don ' t use your spic names , no one wants to have to deal with a Jose or Juan in this nation . "" But I had them on the strawberries , I proved with geometrical logic that the bell boy must have stole them . "Actually , that last line was from his friend Captain Queeg of the U . S . S . Caine , but nevermind . Whitten could have said it .Mr Whitten ( or sir , or Massuh ) , justified his desire for those around him to change their names . " Nothing more than I ' ve done " , he reported . " My family used to be McBogtrotter , we changed it to Whitten when we came to America from Ireland . "As to his employees speaking Spanish , he points out that it ' s hard to maintain discipline when someone ' s always saying " muy estupido " whenever you pass by , and you don ' t know what that means .The residents of this tiny town of hippies and dippies are , of course , up in arms . " How dare he come in here with his 2 million dollars to revitalize this ailing town , and actually expect efficiency and professionalism ? Doesn ' t he realize that we ' re all injuns , spics and bums here ? " , said Mayor Running Bull Menendez .But the Marine remains defiant . " While I wasn ' t trying to upset anyone , I will have order . Or else . I expect that if my ancestors could eat shit when they first got here , that so can these guys . And I further expect that my latest rule jus primus noctis will be followed , at once . "With that he went back to his suite to wait for the first wife . 	 1

washington the administration's top counterterrorism adviser said thursday he was aware of the cia's enhanced interrogation techniques that critics describe as torture while serving as a top official at the agency but did nothing to stop them because he had no oversight role. " i did not take steps to stop the cia use of those techniques, " john brennan told his senate confirmation hearing. brennan was nominated by president barack obama to lead the spy agency after gen. david petraeus resigned from the job over an extramarital affair. the issue was controversial in the administration of former president george w. bush in the aftermath of the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. in answering questions about the techniques, brennan acknowledged that he knew another part of the agency was carrying out a directive from the bush administration. five things we learned from john brennan's confirmation hearing " i had awareness that the agency was being asked to do it i was aware that the agency was moving ahead on it, " he told the senate intelligence committee, adding that he was not involved in managing it. at the time, brennan was the cia's deputy executive director. on the same issue, brennan said a committee report on the interrogation techniques contained " disturbing " information that raised questions about whether he knew what really happened. the 6, 000 page report took six years to compile, and brennan said he read the 300 page executive summary before thursday's hearing. " now i have to determine what the truth is, " he said. " i don't know what the truth is. " under persistent questioning by sen. carl levin, d michigan, brennan pledged that waterboarding would never be used under his direction, but he refused to label it torture. on the issue of drone strikes on terrorist targets abroad, brennan defended the 2011 killing of yemeni american anwar al awlaki as part of the war against al qaeda. brennan said al awlaki's involvement in efforts to kill americans made him a legitimate military target. under prodding from committee chairwoman sen. dianne feinstein, d california, brennan confirmed a connection between al awlaki and umar farouk abdulmutallab, who failed in his attempt to detonate an explosive in his underwear as his northwest airlines flight approached detroit on christmas day in 2009. however, brennan offered no details of the connection, and noted al awlaki's role as a propagandist for al qaeda who fomented anti american sentiments via the internet. the hearing was temporarily halted at the start when protesters repeatedly interrupted brennan's opening statement. some waved signs accusing him of war crimes because of the drone attacks. feinstein ordered the room cleared of spectators and told security officers to prevent the re entry of protesters from code pink, which describes itself as a women initiated group for peace and social justice. brennan is considered to be behind the administration's dramatic rise in the use of drones against terrorist suspects. several strikes have killed americans, notably al awlaki. opinion : bring drones out of the shadowsbrennan defended the drone program, saying that obama " insisted that any actions we take will be legally grounded, will be thoroughly anchored in intelligence, will have the appropriate review process, approval process before any action is contemplated, including those actions that might involve the use of lethal force. " " my role as the president's counterterrorism adviser was to help to orchestrate this effort over the past four years to ensure, again, that any actions we take fully comport with our law and meet the standards that i think this committee and the american people expect of us as far as taking actions we need to protect the american people, but at the same time ensuring that we do everything possible before we need to resort to lethal force, " he said. an unclassified outline of the administration's policy given last summer to congress indicated that the government could use lethal force against an american overseas if the person was a senior operational leader of al qaeda or one of its affiliates and an attack was imminent. the document was demanded by lawmakers, mainly democrats concerned about secrecy in national security decision making, before brennan's hearing. it outlines the justice department's legal rationale for the policy of using lethal force against u. s. citizens fighting on behalf of terrorist groups. according to an official who spoke on the condition of not being identified, obama decided to turn over the legal opinion because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy. on thursday, senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy, d vermont, and ranking member chuck grassley, r iowa, sent a letter to obama calling on him to share with the committee any legal memos on the targeted killings of americans abroad. " the deliberate killing of a united states citizen pursuant to a targeted operation authorized or aided by our government raises significant constitutional and legal concerns that fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the committee, " they wrote. one of the questions the committee submitted to brennan in advance 	 0
TORRANCE , CA Denny Marzano , a 28 year old Torrance man , was arrested Monday for engaging in the type of behavior found in romantic comedies .Marzano was taken into custody after violating a restraining order filed against him by Kellie Hamilton , 25 , an attractive , unmarried kindergarten teacher who is new to the L . A . area . According to Hamilton , Marzano has stalked her for the past two months , spying on her , tapping her phone , serenading her with The Carpenters ' " Close To You " at her place of employment , and tricking her into boarding Caribbean bound jets .Hamilton made the call to police at approximately 7 : 30 p . m . , when she discovered that the bearded cable repairman she had let into her apartment was actually Marzano in disguise ." Thank God he ' s in custody , and this nightmarish ordeal is finally over , " said Hamilton , a single mother struggling to raise an adorable , towheaded boy all alone in the big city . " I repeatedly told him I wasn ' t interested , but he just kept resorting to crazier and crazier schemes to make me fall in love with him . "Marzano , who broke his leg last week falling off a ladder leaning against Hamilton ' s second story bedroom window , said he was " extremely surprised " that his plan to woo Hamilton had failed ." She was supposed to hate me at first but gradually be won over by my incredible persistence , telling me that no one has ever gone to such wild lengths to win her love , " Marzano said . " But for some reason , her irritation never turned to affection . "In addition to the stalking charges , Marzano is accused of framing Stuart Polian , a handsome Pasadena attorney and chief competitor for Hamilton ' s hand , for arson . Marzano denied the charge ." While it is true that I would love to have seen my main romantic rival out of the picture , I did not burn down that animal shelter and try to pin it on Mr Polian , " Marzano said . " I believe and have always believed I can win Kellie ' s love without resorting to such illegalities . "Marzano had been arrested for engaging in romantic comedy behavior on five previous occasions . The most recent arrest came in May 1998 , when he pretended to be a confession booth priest in the hopes of manipulating a Fresno , CA , woman into unwittingly revealing her love for him . 	 1

If " everything that is done in the world is done by hope , " then the Jan . 15 Martin Luther King Jr . celebration at Lyons Township High School modeled what Martin Luther King Jr . was quoted as saying ." It is about hope , " said principal Brian P . Waterman .Waterman spoke at the school ' s Martin Luther King Jr . annual national holiday recognition at the south campus in Western Springs ."

LAS VEGAS Dr Phil McGraw , one of America ' s most famous psychologists was in Las Vegas on business , which he said amounted to basically visiting some of the money he has lost at the slot machines .He was approached by Tittle Tattle Tonight ' s Tapioca Swizzle who asked him if the divorce rumors surrounding his marriage were true .Dr Phil hollered out " What ? " and proceeded to inform Miss Swizzle that he and his wife of 36 years , Robin have never been happier .He then confessed that if they were any happier they would probably both be in prison .Dr Phil first became famous when he began appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1998 .He would be featured in segments where he would help audience members with problems dealing with addictions to smoking , drinking , tongue wrestling , planking , and same sex menage a trois ' .Miss Swizzle , knowing that he has had many celebrity patients , asked Dr Phil how he would approach the problem child known as Lindsay Lohan .Dr Phil shook his head , rolled his eyes , and threw up his arms . He replied that he has read a lot of articles and seen lots of entertainment news programs dealing with 26 year old Lindsay Lohan .He said that he has had some very difficult patients such as Paris Hilton , Andy Dick , Gary Busey , Naomi Campbell , and Gilbert Gottfried , but he pointed out that he has never had to deal with an out of control , loose as hell cannon like one Lindsay Lohan .Dr McGraw stated that he hates to say it but Lohan is pretty much a lost cause because in order for someone to change their horrendous attitude , their self centered personality , and their egomaniacal behavior , they first have to admit that they have a problem .He went on to say that the way things are going Miss Lohan will soon be on her way to prison .Dr Phil explained that getting Lohan to admit that she has a problem is tantamount to getting Sarah " Snowballs " Palin to once and for all admit the truth which is that no one , absolutely no one gives a rat ' s ass about her opinion , or about what she thinks about anything .SIDENOTE : Dr Phil did reveal that he has called Lindsay Lohan at least a dozen times , just in the past five months , and told her that he will take her on as a patient free of charge . She finally called and told him that she does not have a problem and for him to stop acting like there is something wrong with her . 	 1
HOLLYWOOD One of the stars of The Twilight Saga : New Moon , Taylor Lautner has agreed to film a public service condom commercial with his ex girlfriend country singer Taylor Swift .Both Taylor ' s agreed to do the commercial , which is entirely sanctioned by The U . S . Prophylactical Department .Lautner and Swift are both truly bothered by the fact that a tremendous amount of young girls in third world countries are getting pregnant even before they learn the vowels , the " i " before " e " except after " c " rule , and the three names of the Jonas brothers .Reports have just come out that state that in third world countries such as Riwanda , Malawi , and Sierra Leone the percentage of girls who are having babies has reached astronomical proportions .And one of the sad consequences is that the girls are so young that they do not even know how to spell and so as a result babies are receiving such weird names as Toeknee ( Tony ) , Jonnknee ( Johnny ) , and Jewdee ( Judy ) .A lot of third world young girl promiscuity is being directly blamed on things such as the use of erotic makeup at a very young age , the fact that girls panties are getting skimpier , and the fact that the girls are drinking low fat milk which comes from cows that have been injected with a female hormone in order to make the milk whiter .One third world country that has now fallen into the ranks of being a fourth world country is Burundi . And the reason for the country moving down in the rankings is due to the fact that the average young girl spends more money on makeup such as lipstick , mascara , and lip gloss in one month then she does on teen magazines and CD ' s for the entire year .So as a result the girls are not really learning how to read or sing along with CD ' s but they sure know how to put makeup on and make themselves look like they are 23 , or 24 .The governments of Malawi and Burundi have asked the United States to film a commercial showing that the use of condoms can prevent 98 percent of all pregnancies .They also want to show and stress the fact that proper use of a condom can also prevent young teens from catching things such as the mumps , athlete ' s foot , and even in some cases dandruff .In other news . Vice President Joe Biden has cancelled his scheduled trip to Italy because of the recent spaghetti epidemic , which has had an adverse affect on the meatball and tomato sauce industries . 	 1
The Los Angeles School Police Department has received 61 M16 assault rifles , three grenade launchers , and a mine resistant vehicle from the Pentagon via its 1033 program to get rid of surplus military equipment and give them to local policed departments . This has gotten a lot of attention ever since the Ferguson Police Department decided to roll through town outfitted like an occupying army rather than a peacekeeping force .But Chief Steven Zipperman of the LA School Police complained that his mine resistant vehicle had a tiny turret on top with which to kill rioting students " outside agitators . " " The San Diego School Police got a real tank with a huge turret . Their turrets bigger than mine , " complained Zipperman ." Not only that , but the Los Angeles Police Department has surplus military equipment that includes much bigger guns that the Pentagon gave us . They have machine guns and we just have assault rifles , " said the school cop ." What ' s up with that " , " questioned Chief Zipperman ? I want a gun as big as LAPD ' s Top Gun , Charlie Beck , " he said ." Well , at least we have the Vietnam War grenade launchers and our snipers in those really neat camouflage uniforms and army surplus boots ready to kill the Isis sleeper cells students that are probably already in our L . A . schools , " said Zipperman .Chief Beck , In hearing of Chief Steven ' s complaints about the small turret and guns , as compared to those of the LAPD , said that his city cop department was bigger than the school district police departments ." This is clearly a case of gun turret envy , " said Beck . 	 1
As a Broncos fan , I hope he doesn t play but wish him a speedy recovery .It was a devastating injury , that luckily didn t effect this game but against the Broncos it can be huge . Would love to have him out there but don t want him losing an arm just to play a Super Bowl .He ll play . This guy is a different level of toughness .This man is a beast with a huge heart . I can t doubt for a moment he ll be in the game if there is even a chance for him to play .He deserves it . Heart and soul of this team . Keep pounding .I hate that TD broke his arm in this game . It totally sucks , but just watching him for his whole career here in NC , I don t doubt for a minute that he ll give it everything he has to play in the Super Bowl !We re all behind you , TD ! ! ! ! Get well soon andI believe him . Remember the replay of him popping his dislocated finger back in midplay then making the tackle ? Yep , I believe him .Yeah , no . He s not playing . Maurkice Pouncey said the same thing five years ago , and he only sprained his ankle .Big break for the Donkeys , but they re still going to get annihilated .Let s all laugh at how the Patriots aren t even in it !Broncos defense will destroy the Panthers . Von Miller is Cam Newton s kryptonite . Newton will panic and throw interceptions .Just a reminder for y all , the last time the 1 defense and 1 offense played each other in a Super Bowl , the 1 defense won 43 8 . This was no ordinary 1 offense either , it was the best in NFL history . So those of you who think the Panthers are just going to roll the Broncos over have another thing coming .Panthers defense will destroy the Broncos . Josh Norman Luke Kuechly Kawann Short Star Thomas Davis Charles Johnson is Peyton Manninng s krypton its . Manninng s will throw for about 70 yards and it won t be close .Just a reminder for y all , the last time the 1 defense and 1 offense played each other in a Super Bowl , the 1 defense won 43 8 . This was no ordinary 1 offense either , it was the best in NFL history . So those of you who think the Panthers are just going to roll the Broncos over have another thing coming .Yes , but Seattle didn t have a great offense to match its 1 defense . Carolina has both a great offense and a great defense . It s scary how complete a team Carolina is .He ll play , period A broken arm ? I hope he does . Denver by one .He will rub some dirt on it and be right back in the thick of it . Gutsy dude ! !Blackbeard ? you must have forgotten that WR Terrell Owens played in the Super Bowl on a leg that had been broken not much earlier than Davis broke his arm .The worst injury I can say I ve played with in football is a shattered finger . Shattered mid game , buddy taped it and kept buddy taping it for a few games .After about three weeks it starting turning colors at the nail and that was it , season done . They had to rebreak it and get rid of all the bone . Steel plates and rods .In retrospect , not worth it . Of course , that was high school and he s going to the Super Bowl . If you can swing it , put a guard on that arm and chew some percocet .fractured arm YES . broken arm NO . sorry dude the NFL will not let you play with a giant cast .All the pot smokers in Colorado are showing their lack of understanding about football and REAL men , especially from North Carolina .Don t worry . He ll play in the SB next year , if not this one .Peyton put up 43 points against the Steelers and Pats defenses combined . God help him in two weeks .And that edge rush will only flush Newton to where he is most dangerous ? out of the pocket .I mean , I m sure Elway wanted Manning to experience his career ending Super Bowl experience , but does he have to take him through the first three to get there ?Nobody gets blown out in Super Bowls as well as the Denver Broncos . Embrace it . 	 0

I couldn ' t be more proud of a group of guys , " said Gibbons . " They laid it out there every day . They ' re really competitors . I tip my hat to them . "Jose Bautista embodied that fighting spirit on Friday with two home runs , his second a two run shot in the eighth inning that tied the score at 3 3 .Kansas City pushed ahead again in the bottom of the inning but still the Jays did not go quietly .Russell Martin looped a single in the ninth and pinch runner Dalton Pompey immediately stole second and third base to get in prime position to score the tying run off closer Wade Davis .But Davis struck out Dioner Navarro and Ben Revere then retired American League MVP candidate Josh Donaldson on a grounder to end it ." I knew we would fight to the end . That ' s who these guys are . We just couldn ' t get it done against Wade Davis , who stepped up like he ' s done last few years , " said Gibbons .Toronto starter David Price gave up a first inning home run to Ben Zobrist and a contested homer in the second to Mike Moustakas , but settled down to turn in a strong showing .He yielded five hits and one walk , while striking out eight in 6 2 3 innings . The lefty , 0 7 in seven previous postseason starts , was charged with a third run when reliever Aaron Sanchez gave up an RBI single . Closer Roberto Osuna took the loss ." I hope that quiets things down for David , " Gibbons said about criticism of Price . " He ' s having a great career . He stepped up tonight . Couple of solo home runs early . Kept it right there and gave us a shot ." We ' re all disappointed that we ' re not moving on , but that ' s baseball . We put up our best fight .

WASHINGTON Barely two months after U . N . inspectors in Iran failed to find evidence of an active nuclear weapons program , the Department of Homeland Security uncovered new information Monday proving the Middle Eastern nation has obtained literally trillions of atoms the same particles sometimes used to make atomic bombs for unknown purposes ." We have no doubt that Iran now possesses an alarming number of atoms within its borders , despite countless warnings from the international community , " Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said at a press conference Monday afternoon , as he pointed to a satellite image marked with dozens of locations where his office claims the unauthorized atoms are being held . " The Iranians maintain the atoms are only being used to form the building blocks of all existence , but we cannot afford to take that risk . "The atoms , which DHS officials believe to be " the smallest indivisible units of any element , " were first discovered in aerial photographs taken of a laboratory in central Isfahan . When the photographs were enlarged several hundred thousand times , additional clusters of atoms known in intelligence circles as " matter " were spotted in large cargo trucks parked nearby the facility , in storage units on the grounds , and in the pockets , shoes , clothing , hair , and skin of several nuclear physicists in the parking lot .More alarming , officials said , is the " very likely " possibility that there are more atoms inside the laboratory ." The threat of atoms in Iran is real , " said Chertoff , showing reporters an empty vial to illustrate his point . " Even as we speak , Iranians are turning millions of carbon atoms into a powerful energy source they can use to strengthen their armies , pilots , president , and someday perhaps , a team of nuclear physicists . "Earlier this month , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a visit to the region , where she reportedly observed atoms being smuggled across the border from neighboring countries Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as daily shipments of atoms from as far away as Russia , China , and the troposphere . Secretary Rice also witnessed atoms being strategically used to deliver televised press conferences regarding the nonproliferation of Iranian atoms ." Security checkpoints have been unable to stop the flow of atoms into Iran , " Rice said . " Even with the best equipment available , it is nearly impossible to distinguish dangerous atoms that could be used in fission for the purposes of massive destruction from the kind of atoms that are functioning primarily as mechanical pencils . "Added Rice : " We cannot afford to let these atoms fall into , or be a part of , the wrong hands . "Vice President Dick Cheney and his staff were briefed on the atomic situation in Iran Tuesday with the aid of colorful interlocking plastic models and a short film ." The United States will not stand idly by while Iran gains the protons , neutrons , and whatever else they need to threaten the free world , " Cheney said at a press conference that afternoon . " Iran has demonstrated time and time again its ability to combine atoms of hydrogen and oxygen right out in the open , and we cannot allow that to go on any longer . "Iranian officials claim the atoms are being used only for peaceful , life sustaining purposes , and that it is physically impossible for Iran or any government to create or destroy matter in order to comply with U . S . regulations .Next month , U . N . inspectors will visit Iran to investigate and catalog all of the nation ' s current atomic holdings in order to determine if the country may be stockpiling dangerous atoms in unregistered laboratories , underground facilities , above ground facilities , the citizenry , air , water , soil , grass , shoes , picnic lunches , pets , flaky pastries , or the numerous nuclear warheads the country has recently featured in parades . 	 1

birmingham, al for nearly 150 years, the ku klux klan has been steadfast in its commitment to the ideals of its founders. these traditional values preservation of white cultural heritage, strict adherence to christian principles, and broad based coalition building against the inferior dog races of asia and africa have served to strengthen the klan throughout its long and proud history. but now, these time honored traditions are under siege. though the midnight raids and public hangings are no longer as visible as they once were, the importance of preserving klan tradition is now greater than ever, as hundreds of loosely associated kkk factions some official, most not struggle to preserve a sense of unity in an increasingly divided aryan nation. today, the klan's fragile, hard won cohesion is unraveling, as a splinter group of progress minded klansmen is challenging one of the group's most dearly held beliefs : the subhuman, animal status of non white minorities. this small group of reformers is claiming nothing less than that blacks and jews may be partially related to human, or white, beings. and that has many in the klan crying foul. " it's heresy is what it is, " said clement dawes, former kkk grand wizard and clarksdale, ms, yam farmer. " saying that blacks and jews are half human, i can't believe it. they may as well be claiming that slavery and lynching are half wrong. " critics say the reformers are betraying the teachings of their forefathers. but the reformers say they're only trying to bring the klan into the modern era. " new advances in the mapping of the human genome show that there's a strong possibility that blacks and jews and perhaps even the wily chinee are partially human, sharing some genetic characteristics with whites, " said reform kkk grand exalted cyclops darrell walker, speaking from the splinter group's birmingham headquarters. " i didn't set out to be a crusader, but we cannot blindly shut out the truth, however disturbing it may be. if we do, we are as bad as the filthy, savage blacks and jews themselves, for as jesus said, we have eyes but don't see. " pastor fred knox of smyrna, ga, grand exalted dragon of the ku klux klan, disagreed. " these liberal scum are selling out everything right and true that they profess to believe in, " knox said. " they don't deserve to wear the robes and hoods of a true klansman. it pains my heart to hear such lies from the mouth of a white man. " stung by such criticism, walker and his followers insist they are as committed to virulent race hate as any god fearing kkk member. calling knox's remarks " lies twisting our words to his own narrow minded agenda, " he said his group's motives are pure. " why must they sow the seeds of discord instead of working with us in peace? we all want to drive the niggers back to africa. we all hate the jew bankers, " walker said. " we all want the same thing : for the mongrel races to be driven from our shores so that good christian white folk can live in peace. is that so wrong? " but to walker's enemies, such pleas for tolerance and understanding are merely the slippery, fork tongued rhetoric of jew loving race traitors. " oh, the words fall like honey from his lips, " said longtime kkk member anthony couch of monroe, la. " mr walker distorts words like the jew run media. blacks part human the very idea! what does he expect us to do, half hate them? " some klansmen say that while walker's ideas are sound, he is moving too quickly and should aim for more gradual change. " people need time, " said grand dragon joseph hamm, a noted moderate. " you can't erase deeply held beliefs just like that. he may as well expect the whole aryan community to magically achieve widespread literacy, presto, overnight. " yet despite the opposition, walker's movement is slowly winning support. a growing number of kkk members feel that the organization is too inflexible, and that klan doctrine is too tradition bound. " of course, minorities should be hunted and persecuted nobody's saying they shouldn't, " kkk member bob parrish of bessemer, al, said.

The discovery of millions of extra ballots proves that President Robert Mugabe intends to rig next week ' s elections in his favor , Zimbabwe ' s main opposition party said Sunday .President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre election rally in Harare on Saturday .Tendai Biti , secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change , said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million .However , the African country has an electorate of 5 . 7 million registered voters , he said .Also , 600 , 000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers , Biti said .Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad , and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50 , 000 , he said ." Remember , when they stole this election away from us the last time , they stole it with 350 , 000 votes , " Biti said . " Six hundred thousand is double insurance . They cannot win a free and fair election in this country . "The elections are slated for Saturday .Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging .The president ' s other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni , who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party .Last week , New York based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections , saying it was likely to be " deeply flawed . "" As the elections near , all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice , " the nongovernmental organization said in a 48 page report .The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule .The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly . Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule .That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official ." What qualifies them to do what they ' re doing policing the world and Africa in particular ? " asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu , political consul at Zimbabwe ' s embassy in Washington ." Why don ' t they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections ? " he said . " Come on , give me a break ! You can ' t judge the elections before they are held . "No matter the final outcome of the election , the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair . Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe , and there are no credible monitors in place .Since 1980 , the 84 year old Mugabe has been the country ' s only ruler . But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe ' s dire economic situation .The rate of inflation reported in January was 100 , 000 percent , and food and fuel are in short supply , the Human Rights Watch document said . With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed , few could afford such food and fuel anyway .The country ' s downward economic spiral began in 2000 , when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms , turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies .For his part , Mugabe remains defiant , blaming his country ' s economic woes on the West .

Prince Harry has just returned from Helmand Province , Afghanistan from where he has been serving on the front line of the British Army facing the Taliban , one of the most ferocious foes on this planet .Harry stood alongside the Ghurkhas who are considered some of the bravest warriors ever to step on to a Battlefield . Harry apparently led from the front and risked his life on numerous occasions .The coming home of Harry has resulted in some of the most scandalous reporting ever seen on the British News , in a Newspaper or on a Website .The extremely well respected first lady of reporting The Queen Madder has stated that " Nine out of Ten Taliban warlords say that their confidence soared after seeing Harry poncing around in designer gear swigging a bottle of lager . "The bottle she refers too , " was almost certainly Buxton Spring Water which is a favourite drink of all soldiers particularly after a long day on an extremely hot and dusty battlefield . "Wonkey Moods a winner of the Newspaper Oscars reported a pack of porkies stating that " Harry wishes that England should sink , he does not like the Country very much and he is much happier being in South Africa spending quality time in the bush . "Wonkey did not go on to make clear which bush he was referring too .Gordon Benney a very experienced and respected War Correspondent should be extremely ashamed of reporting that Harry was seen accompanied by two blondes falling out of a Kabul Nightclub .It is well known in Journalistic circles that Benney himself has never stepped foot on a Battlefield but always reports from the safest boozer .Then there was top writer named Huff who claimed that Harry referred to " his home Country as pants . "Actually Harry said " England is Top Drawer , as that is where most people keep their pants . "Duncan Whitehorse a leading American writer reported that " Harry was brought home for his own safety as dyslexic terrorists had threatened to pluck him like a chicken . "In fact Harry , who had been having a quiet shandy in Basra Cafe on the way to Afghanistan , sorted out twenty Al Queda Terrorists single handed .He was unfortunately later involved in a skirmish with a Taxi driver but it must be said " that it was entirely the Taxi Drivers fault . "Award winning writer Tragic Bobbitt wrote that " Harry was looking forward to a round of toasted ham sandwiches and a nice hot bubble bath amid his collection of squeaky ducks . "How would the Bobbitt like , to not have a wash for ten weeks and exist on corn beef hash for every meal while trying to bed a gorgeous blond Army Nurse ?Scandalous reporting I say !Prince Harry is a wonderful example of good clean honest living and a damn fine young man .Sir Ivor Biggun acknowledges and fully respects the opinions and normally extremely accurate stories produced by The Queen Mudder , Monkey Woods , Gordon Bennet , Duff , Duncan Whitehead and Tragic Rabbit . 	 1

Petersburg ' s fiercely nationalist Cossack community to commemorate the allies ' victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War .The comparison of the strongman with the leaders of ancient Rome was in part inspired by Putin ' s decision to back pro Russian separatists in the Ukraine , Newsweek reported .The clay mould was designed by a St . Petersburg sculptor , backed by the city ' s popular Cossack communityThe bust is at the St Petersburg ' s Academy of arts , ahead to its unveiling at an underground stationSt Petersburg ' s traditionalist Cossack group Irbis , a popular organisation supporting Slavic military values , said the bust of Putin will be placed at an underground station in north St Petersburg .The city , formally Leningrad , is Putin ' s home town .The bust ' s designer , sculptor Pavel Greshnikov , was quoted as saying he had considered portraying the Russian leader in a suit and tie , in military fatigues and even in medieval armour .The statue is complete with a laurel wreath and other trappings of the Roman Empire .It is at Greshinov ' s workshop at the St Petersburg Academy of arts , ahead to its unveiling .Putin may have upset some people with his Ukrainian activities , but in his hometown he is still popularCossacks have grown in popularity in Russian since the fall of communism in the 80s and 90s .The group , which prides itself on military valour and its Russian Orthodox Christian roots , has particularly warmed to Putin ' s increasingly traditional values .Andrey Polykov , a local Cossack leader in St Petersburg , backed the creation of the Putin Statue .Lenin was commemorated in bronze throughout the USSR . However in many places the statues were torn down after the fall of communismHe was quoted as saying the Russian leader was one of the country ' s ' brightest ' and most ' positive ' heads of state for ' the last hundred years or so ' .Polykov claimed Putin had a record as a peacemaker following wars in Georgia in 2008 and Moldova in the early 1990s .Boris Yeltsin , Putin ' s predecessor , has also been immortalised in sculpture . A statue of the post Soviet leader was erected in Yekaterinburg in 2011 .Andrey Polyakov said his Cossack community had been planning for a long time to erect the Putin statue 	 0
the nation's largest private prison company is being held in contempt of court by a federal judge for chronic understaffing at an idaho prison. u. s. district judge david carter made the ruling against the nashville, tenn. based corrections corporation of america in a scathing 24 page ruling issued on monday. in it, carter took the company to task for lying about staffing levels and warned that he would make the fines as big as needed to force cca's compliance with a settlement agreement it reached two years ago with idaho inmates and the american civil liberties union.'if a prospective fine leads to 2. 4 million in penalties, cca has no one to blame but itself,'carter wrote. prison south of boise so understaffed and violent that prisoners called it'gladiator school'the contempt finding stems from a case that began in 2010 when the aclu sued on behalf of inmates at the ise, contending that the facility was so violent that prisoners called it'gladiator school'and that understaffing and mismanagement contributed to the problem. cca denied the allegations, but reached a settlement agreement with the inmates, promising to increase staffing levels above what was then required under its 29 million contract with the idaho department of correction. that settlement agreement was slated to expire this month, but the aclu asked the judge to extend it and find cca in contempt for failing to abide by the agreement. cca acknowledged earlier this year that its employees filed reports with the state that falsely showed 4, 800 hours of vacant security posts as being staffed during 2012. but during the contempt of court hearing earlier this month, witnesses revealed that number only included the night shift during a seven month span. judge david carter makes ruling against corrections corporation of america'it is clear that the non compliance was far worse than the report of about 4, 800 hours would lead one to believe,'carter wrote.'there is also no reason to believe the problem only began in april 2012 and was solved after october 2012,'carter added.'indeed, even in the weeks prior to the contempt hearings, mandatory posts were still going unfilled thus there remains persistent staffing pressure that is the backdrop to prison employees fabricating records.'the difference today is that cca may finally be presenting an accurate picture of its inability to fully staff its prison.'from now on, any mandatory post left unstaffed for more than 12 hours in a month will bring fines of 100 an hour, carter wrote. he warned that he would raise the fine to 500 an hour or higher if things don't change. the judge also rejected cca's contention that the former warden and other company officials didn't know about the understaffing, saying that they had been warned of the staffing problems multiple times and at the very least failed to check it out.'for cca staff to lie on so basic a point whether an officer is actually at a post leaves the court with serious concerns about compliance in other respects, such as whether every violent incident is reported,'carter wrote. from now on, the court will get staffing reports from an independent monitor who will watch staffing levels at the prison and report directly to the federal courts, carter said. he said he wouldn't make cca do an audit to determine just how many hours have been understaffed in the last few years because the idaho department of correction already has such an audit underway. the idaho state police are currently investigating whether cca committed any crimes when it gave the false staffing reports to the idaho department of corrections and when it failed to meet the minimum staffing requirements under its state contract.'further, idoc has contractual remedies against cca it is up to that agency to determine what compensation it pursues for having been lied to,'carter wrote. he also rejected cca's'no harm, no foul'claim that the understaffing didn't lead to increased violence or other problems.'having enough correctional officers can deter violence, but also it offers other benefits, such as having enough staff on the prison floor to accurately track the levels of violence in the first place,'he noted. cca spokesman steven owen said in a prepared statement that the company was reviewing the ruling and considering next steps.'we believe we are taking all appropriate steps to correct the staffing matter and are unaware of any new findings beyond what we've previously acknowledged. we are meeting the contractual staffing requirements and are working on an ongoing basis to ensure that continues,'owen wrote.'our top priority is the safety of our staff, the inmates entrusted to our care and the communities where we operate, and we are committed to providing the state and idaho's taxpayers with the highest quality corrections service.'aclu attorney stephen pevar said in a prepared statement that the organization was thankful to the judge 	 0
disciplinary : ann hughes, 64, was alleged to have run her rural welsh primary school in a'climate of fear'a group of primary school children were left'crying their eyes out'when a strict headmistress asked a police officer to tell them off for pulling faces in their school photograph, a disciplinary hearing was told today. ann hughes allegedly ran ysgol goronwy owen, a village primary school on the isle of anglesey, in a'climate of fear ', swearing at pupils and showing favouritism to those whose first language was welsh. so when a group of 10 year old classmates tried to sabotage the end of year picture because their usual teachers were on strike, she responded'excessively'by asking school liaison officer pc brian jones to reprimand them, it was alleged. the staff members were absent after all but one of the school's teachers called in sick following a vote of no confidence in mrs hughes, who had been headteacher for 17 years, and her'dictatorial'management style. she was later suspended and then sacked from the school in benllech following a catalogue of complaints from teachers and parents, which included calling children names, excessively shouting and punishing them in public. mrs hughes, 64, who previously had a 40 year unblemished teaching record, appeared before the professional conduct committee of the general teaching council for wales, sitting in ewloe, near queensferry, north wales. giving evidence, the mother of one pupil, referred to as pupil l accused mrs hughes of a huge over reaction by asking pc jones to intervene following the incident involving year six children in june 2011.'he ( her son ) came home from school absolutely distraught,'she said.'he was crying his eyes out, saying he was never going to school again. he was terrified.'my dad was a police officer, he has respect for them. he was absolutely terrified.'pc jones admitted some of the children, who had begun a petition and circulated a note to encourage others to sabotage the photo, broke down after he told them he was disappointed with their behaviour. village school : the panel was told mrs hughes had been the head of ysgol goronwy owen for 17 years'i spoke to them as a class, i didn't speak to any individual children,'he said.'i told them how some of them had made a member of staff cry and how a few of them had ruined the photo for the whole class.'i told them that if they had an issue they should have talked about it and should not have been seeking to sabotage the photo or manipulating others.'one or two did break down and start crying, i remember a large number of children turning to look at those responsible. in my view they were crying because of the guilt at what they had done.'panel : ann hughes arrives at the hearing todaypresenting officer martin jones suggested the reason the children were upset was because they thought they were in trouble with the police. pc jones said he would be'inordinately surprised'if they believed it was a criminal matter, although he admitted he could not be certain. in fact, the officer, who said he was treated like a'celebrity'by pupils every time he went to the school, received an angry phone call from one of their fathers following the ticking off.'he rang me and said he was angry, he said it was not criminal that his child didn't want to take part in the photo and i agreed with him,'the police officer added. mrs hughes, of llanfairpwllgwyngyll, faces further allegations including that she used the word'c p'when speaking to pupils, repeatedly called one child'twp'the welsh word for'stupid'and shouted excessively in the classroom. she is also accused of failing to investigate and address bullying of two pupils, highlighting parents'complaints during school assembly thereby potentially identifying pupils, and engaging in unnecessary open criticism of children's mistakes. further claims include openly criticising a pupil's error in the spelling of his middle name and tearing up his sats examination paper in front of him, and being insensitive by commenting on the length of a pupil's absence to his brother following the death of their father. supply teacher bethan roberts told the hearing the school was left'up the creek without a paddle'when five of the six permanent teachers phoned in sick on the same day in may 2011. she said she never heard mrs hughes shouting in class and blamed'lack of co operation'from the staff, who were often seen'whispering'about the headteacher, for the problems. they returned in the new school year in september, following mrs hughes'suspension, and two temporary headteachers were put in charge. however, during that time 23 children were pulled from the school by their parents because of the 	 0
NEW YORK Actor James Gandolfini , best known for his portrayal of mob kingpin Tony Soprano on the hit HBO show The Sopranos , was shot to death Tuesday in a Greenwich Village restaurant by a fan unable to accept the open ended conclusion of the series finale that aired earlier this month .According to police reports , 28 year old marketing research assistant Louis Bowen walked into the small Italian restaurant Occhiuto ' s at approximately 7 : 40 p . m . and headed directly toward Gandolfini ' s table . Bowen then drew a snub nosed . 38 revolver from his jacket and shot Gandolfini point blank in the head three times before dropping the gun and calmly exiting the eatery .Bowen was apprehended two blocks away by two NYPD officers and reportedly put up no resistance ." I couldn ' t let it just hang , " Bowen told police in a post arrest confession released to the media . " Eight years of my life , and a artsy cut to black ? It was eating me up inside . "In his statement , Bowen also used the word " betrayal " to describe the series ' s resolution , which he was convinced set up a climactic death for the sociopathic mafia don . The realization that Soprano ' s brutal life of constant fear and anxiety would have no real end slowly drove the obsessed Bowen over the edge ." I had to tie up the loose ends , I just had to , " Bowen said . " I ' m positive this is exactly how creator and executive producer David Chase wanted fans to interpret the ending . "NYPD spokesman Charles Krann expressed regret over the Gandolfini slaying , saying that law enforcement " should have known this was coming , " considering the heavy foreshadowing of impending doom in The Sopranos ' final season and the lack of payoff ." The symbolism and dialogue clearly conveyed an ominous sense of death and decay , " Krann said . " Particularly the scene in the second to last episode where Tony and his brother in law talk about death . So for Bowen , murdering the actor brought a kind of justice . "" It probably would have all been different had there been a realistic chance of a Sopranos movie , " Krann added .Gandolfini ' s murder comes in the wake of several recent attempts on the actor ' s life following the airing of the series finale , which included a car bomb that exploded when he remote started his car , and an attempted garroting while he rode in the front seat of a cab . Though the star is mourned by millions , many expressed relief that Tony Soprano ' s saga is definitively over ." Thank God it finally happened , " said Lenox Hill Hospital general surgery resident David Kinsky , who was sitting at a table adjacent to Gandolfini ' s at the time of the murder . " I just knew that was how the story was meant to end . After the finale , I was so anxious and depressed I could hardly sleep . "Yet other eyewitnesses characterized Gandolfini ' s death as " predictable , " " cheap , " and " devoid of imagination . "" I ' m an intelligent person I didn ' t need to be spoon fed an ending like this , " Occhiuto ' s bartender Kim Romano said . " The killer obviously didn ' t get that the finale was meant to show Tony doomed to live out his violent gangland existence in an infinite , monotonous loop . Like the Journey song at the end said , ' It goes on and on and on and on . ' "Ironically , far from satisfactorily resolving the fate of Tony Soprano , Gandolfini ' s brutal slaying will most likely only intensify the controversy among fans , and will serve as prime water cooler discussion material for days , if not weeks , to come .In a late night City Hall press conference , New York mayor Michael Bloomberg refused to comment on the killing ." No , no , don ' t tell me what happened , " said Bloomberg , hastily plugging his ears . " I TiVo ' ed the last six episodes but I ' ve been too busy to watch them . No spoilers , please . " 	 1
White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , today , blasted his oncologist for what he called " a blatant , and totally irresponsible mischaracterization of the battle against Snow ' s cancer . "" We ' re making progress on my pelvis . " Snow said from his familiar podium , " and yes , right now things could be going better in my liver , but why does the medical community always have to focus on where the problems are , instead of focusing on the successes ? Like my lungs completely cancer free , but you ' d never know it , listening to doctors . "Snow ' s oncologist , Dr Ankit Ventrakramin , defended his comments ." I simply gave Mr Snow an honest and professional prognosis based on his cancer having spread to the liver . This type of cancer has a very low survival rate over 5 years and not the greatest prognosis over 1 year , especially if surgery is not an option . "But Snow did not back down ." Dr Ventrakramin ' s comments are not only completely unwarranted and inaccurate , they ' re dangerous . Right now it is a critical time in my body . We ' ve removed one cancerous growth , and we ' re starting to turn the tide against the affliction . My doctors comments , however , could serve to embolden my cancer , and turn back all the progress we ' ve made . "While it is true that those in the medical profession tend to focus on problem areas , rather than on successes , Dr Burns , of the Mayo Clinic , says this is neither unexpected , nor undesirable ." We focus on the problems so we can try to fix them . What is so God damn difficult to understand about that ? "The debate rages on , but meanwhile , President Bush , has voiced his support for Mr Snow in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Protestant People ." If we fail in curing Tony Snow , it is because Dr Ventrakramin , President Ahmadinejad of Iran , and others like them , have irresponsibly emboldened the enemy with their pessimism , therefore undermining Tony in his battle against this most deadly opponent . "Bush then gripped the podium and faced the camera , obviously choked with emotion . " Make no mistake , if Snow should succumb to this cowardly invader , we WILL deal with Iran . " 	 1
washington, dc a bill introduced by sen. george allen ( r va ) as " just a goof " several weeks ago was signed into law by president bush tuesday. " i was just trying to crack up frist and some of the other guys, " allen said. " everyone's been on edge lately, what with the katrina situation, and i thought we could use a good laugh. " added allen : " looks like the joke's on me. and, i suppose, the american citizens. " s. 1718, also known as the preservation of public lands of america act, authorized a shift of 138 billion from the federal medicare fund to a massive landscaping effort that, over the next five years, will transform yellowstone national park into a luxury private golf estate. " i thought it was pretty damn funny when i read over the draft of the thing, " said allen, who said he struggled to keep a straight face when he introduced the law. " especially the part about how it would create over 10, 000 caddy and drink girl jobs. but i guess it went over people's heads. " the bill passed with a vote of 63 37. allen said he thought the senate bill clerk was " playing along " when he forwarded the bill to the senate committee on environment and public works. " at the close of the day monday, i went over to thank committee chairman jim inhofe ( r ok ), and told him how i hoped'the bill'got'a fair hearing,'" allen said. " he got real earnest on me, saying how it's his job to give every bill a fair hearing. i said to myself,'my god, he thinks it's for real.'" the 18 member committee sent the bill to the senate floor the next day with an approval vote of 14 4. " i mean, obama didn't vote for it, " allen said, referring to illinois democrat sen. barack obama, who is often at ideological odds with his fellow republican committee members. " i was like,'okay, one guy gets the joke,'but then i talked to him later and i realized he had no idea. when i explained the whole thing, he brought out that chestnut about how'it's not funny if you have to explain it.'" allen added : " he's usually good for a laugh. i don't know what's up. " according to allen, the committee on environment and public works not only took s. 1718 seriously, it inadvertently made it funnier. " i was still sort of frustrated that no one was catching on, but i couldn't help but chuckle a little when the newly amended bill returned to the senate, " allen said. " the thing where they were calling the water hazards'ecological conservation areas'was pure comedy genius. " the only senator to suspect that the act was a joke was sen. joe biden ( d de ), who said he later overcame his suspicions, reasoning that " if it got this far, it must be valid. " " now, the bankruptcy reform bill that passed in april, i thought for sure that was meant to be ironic, " biden said. " i actually voted for it out of total sarcasm. my mistake, obviously. " after passing overwhelmingly with very little deliberation on tuesday, the " obvious put on " traveled to the house, where once again representatives approved it with a vote of 409 26. the experience left allen puzzling for an explanation. " maybe my idea was too dry, " allen said. " maybe i should have introduced a bill that was even crazier, like mandating tracking collars for all american taxpayers. then again, seeing how things turned out, it's probably just as well i didn't. " once allen found out that bush would be signing the bill into law in a special rose garden ceremony, he decided to let the matter drop, saying that he was " in too deep to start explaining things now. " " i respect our commander in chief greatly, " allen said. " but unless gallagher himself stuck the bill in a watermelon and bashed it with his sledge o matic, there's no chance bush would catch on. " following the rose garden ceremony, the news that the newly minted law was conceived as a lark confused some senators. " are we talking about the same bill here? " said sen. arlen specter ( r pa ), who voted for the act. " the golf course legislation, right? i'm sorry, but i still don't get it. is it funny because it was introduced in the senate and not the house? " although allen's bill was assumed to be in earnest, some senators were quick to insist that the senate floor isn't always so humorless. " we're all very serious about our task, 	 1
South Beach , Florida A study reports that elderly people are staying sexually active well into their 60 ' s , 70 ' s , 80 ' s and beyond what God , Mother Nature or their bodies intended . Although no doubt keeping the elderly mentally vibrant and spry , unfortunately , the extra curricular activity has taken its toll resulting a number of injuries to senior citizens that physicians and care providers previously attributed to the onset of advanced years , but no more ." It ' s incredible , " said Geriatrics specialist , Thomas Martinez . " I never would have thought for a second , nor would let mind do so if I tried , that the injuries I was treating all these years in my elderly patients was due to their having sex , and with each other , too . It just freaks me out just thinking about , and I ' m a trained medical professional . "Chief among the most common injuries sustained to the elderly frail bodies : blunt trauma to the pelvis and or hip displacement , abrasions to the knees and denture stains ( sometimes lost or misplaced when left behind at the other ' s retirement home ) .Moreover , physicians caution that with this newest data changes will have to be made to the labeling of pharmaceuticals products the elderly consume to ensure their safety .Some of the new warnings the label may include :" It is encouraging to know that we all have something to look forward to when we retire , " said Helen Monster of the American Geriatrics Institute . " You know something beside taking care of the grandkids or watching the grass grow . "According to the report , an additional drawback , beside the aforementioned , in having geriatric sex : virginal dryness , trouble achieving and maintaining an erection , while simultaneously remaining conscious ." Yeah , that ' s probably where all those fall injuries are coming from , " said Dr Martinez " Sometimes during sex one or both of the sexual active elderly partners suddenly fall asleep , resulting in all those unaccounted for scraps and bruises . Even resulting in one or both falling onto the floor and not being able to get up "" But we have to have to conduct a clinical study of a couple and video tape them to confirm the hypotheses , " continued Dr Martinez . " Only no one on my staff wants to volunteer to conduct that overnight study . "Dr Martinez advises his elderly patients that are sexually active to purchase a medical alert bracelet to inform emergency medical technicians of their availability ." It ' s worth the investment , " said Daniel Roberts , one of Dr Martinez ' s sexually active elderly patients . " It can act as the bling you may need to attract other sexual partners you may have overlooked because of their youthful appearance and your impaired vision , so that way you won ' t miss out on any hot intergenerational sex that ' s going on .

U . S . Sen . Chuck Grassley , R Iowa , is asking the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to look into additional questions about unintended acceleration of Toyota cars .Citing unidentified whistle blowers critical of " too narrow " federal investigations , the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the NHTSA in a letter to look into the phenomenon of " tin whiskers " or crystalline structures of tin that theoretically could lead to the unintended acceleration .The whistle blowers also provided Grassley with documentation about the investigations by NHTSA and NASA into the Toyota vehicles , including one NASA report that stated : " Because proof that the ( electronic throttle control systems ) caused the reported ( unintended accelerations ) was not found does not mean it could not occur . "Grassley ' s letter to the safety agency ' s administrator , David Strickland , asks the agency to provide the committee with all information relating to tin whisker testing and for the agency ' s position on tin whiskers ' possibly causing the unintended acceleration .Last year , a federal investigation into possible causes of the unintended acceleration in Toyota cars found no fault with the automaker ' s electronic throttle control systems , the Department of Transportation said . So far there are three known causes of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles : improperly installed floor mats , sticky pedals and driver error .Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said Thursday that " all the scientific evidence " confirms there ' s no problem with the electronic throttle control systems in Toyota vehicles ." Further , no one has ever found a single real world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event , nor have they put forth any evidence of unintended acceleration occurring in a Toyota vehicle because of tin whiskers forming inside an accelerator pedal position sensor , " Lyons said ." Toyota ' s systems are designed to reduce the risk that tin whiskers will form in the first place and multiple robust fail safe systems are in place to counter any effects on the operation of our vehicles in the highly unlikely event that they do form and connect to adjacent circuitry , " Lyons said .In Grassley ' s letter dated July 12 and released publicly Thursday , the senator asks Strickland why his agency relied on NASA engineers and whether the agency lacks " the sufficient expertise to conduct such investigations and why . "Said Grassley in the letter : " This is a serious issue . From 2000 to 2010 , NASA concluded there were 9 , 698 identified UA ( unintended acceleration ) customer complaints and NHTSA concedes that this is likely only a fraction of the actual incidents of UA : ' NHTSA assumes that not all incidents are reported and that , accordingly , each complaint represents a greater number of unreported real world failures . ' "Grassley asks the agency how many of the 9 , 698 vehicles were inspected for tin whiskers .The 2006 document , marked " confidential , " recounted the results of an adaptive cruise control software test in a model internally designated the 250L , a vehicle later sold as the Lexus 460 in Japan and Europe . The document says a " fail safe overhaul " would be needed for another model in production , internally designated the 180L , which the company says was later sold as a Toyota Tundra .In response , Toyota asserted that the document shows no such thing , and the company continues to deny that any sudden unintended acceleration in any of its vehicles was caused by electronic systems .Toyota insisted the translation was inaccurate . Despite multiple requests , the company didn ' t provide its own translation of the document .Neither the test vehicle nor the adaptive cruise control system cited in the document has been sold in the United States , Toyota said .Grassley set a July 26 deadline for the NHTSA to respond to his eight sets of questions . 	 0

New York ' s governor , citing questions about the driver ' s " criminal record and driving history , " on Monday ordered the state ' s inspector general to investigate how a Brooklyn man got licensed to drive a bus that crashed over the weekend , leading to the deaths of 15 people .The driver , 40 year old Ophadell Williams , has not been charged . Police said Williams told investigators that the incident occurred early Saturday after he swerved to avoid a tractor trailer that might have clipped the bus . The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into the poles , which cut through two thirds of the vehicle .Gov . Andrew Cuomo directed Inspector General Ellen Biben to " commence an immediate investigation " in light of issues related to Williams ' " criminal record and driving history . " In a statement , Cuomo questioned why Williams was able to get and keep a commercial driver ' s license .Staff from the inspector general ' s office will coordinate with the New York state police , as well as the Bronx district attorney ' s office , in the investigation , according to Cuomo .Williams fatally stabbed a man about 20 years ago , leading to a manslaughter conviction , said New York Department of Correctional Services spokeswoman Linda Foglia . He served three of the nine years he was sentenced , from 1992 to 1994 .He was later convicted of grand larceny , leading him to spend parts of the years 1998 to 2002 behind bars , according to Foglia .A New York City official said Monday that a 15th person had died because of injuries related to the crash , which took place in the Bronx , about 5 : 30 a . m . on a stretch of I 95 called the New England Thruway not far from Westchester County . The bus had left the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville , Connecticut , and was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan , according to news reports .Along with those killed , at least seven of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors . At least five people being treated at New York ' s St . Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures , internal bleeding and broken bones , Dr Ernest Patti told reporters .Williams suffered " non life threatening injuries , " police said .Federal investigators are considering other potential causes of the crash , including mechanical problems , steering and brake issues as well as the possibility the driver fell asleep . Some surviving passengers , according to news reports , told police that they felt the bus roll over rumble strips before the crash .At a Sunday afternoon press conference , National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Christopher Hart said investigators are looking for video recordings taken at the casino and , possibly , an electronic hotel key card that might track some of Williams ' activities within 72 hours of the accident .In addition , records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website show that the bus line involved World Wide Travel was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury , and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in one injury .The company has been cited five times for " fatigued driving " between December 2009 and October 2010 twice in in New Jersey , twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut , records show . 	 0
Apple has been accused of kowtowing to the Chinese government by pulling from its China App Store a product enabling users to circumvent firewalls and access restricted sites .It remains available in App Stores outside China .The developer who wished to remain anonymous , saying that " as the developers of an app that protects users ' privacy and anonymity online , it only makes sense to do the same ourselves " said Apple provided no notification that the app had been pulled , with the developers only learning from consumers .OpenDoor , a self described " small team of programmers spread across the world collaborating over the Internet , " considers it has reasonable grounds to challenge Apple ' s move , as its product is a browser app and any content accessed through it is at the discretion of the user .But the developer said there were no plans to try to force the tech giant into a rethink ." Unfortunately , we ' re not aware of any app developer ever ( successful ) in challenging Apple ' s decision . In fact , we won ' t be surprised if Apple decides to pull our app from all app stores and or terminates our account in retaliation ( to publicity over the issue ) . "The developer said that prior to its removal from Apple ' s China App Store on July 11 , the app was being downloaded about 2 , 000 times a day in China , accounting for about a third of the app ' s total downloads .The Chinese government strictly polices Internet access , censoring web users and blocking access to sites deemed sensitive .Chinese social media users were critical of Apple ' s move , saying the decision diminished the company ' s moral standing , and comparing it unfavorably to Google as a champion of Internet freedom ." The fruit is contaminated , " wrote a user on the Twitter like Sina Weibo microblog under the handle XieGov . " Where ' s your integrity ! " asked Shenzhenlangya ." The only one who doesn ' t surrender to evil is my great Google ! " wrote Meihoujiushilaowang .A smaller group were more understanding of the company ' s position , however , acknowledging that conforming to China ' s censorship policy was the price to pay to do business in the country ." Apple is determined to do well in China , " wrote Sina Weibo user Mantianyufeihong . " How can Apple step in to the Chinese market without strict censorship ? How can it do business without showing their sincerity ( to the government ) ? "Other apps previously removed from Apple ' s App Store in China for falling foul of censorship laws include one providing access to forbidden books , and a news app for a U . S . based broadcaster founded by the banned spiritual group Falun Gong . 	 0
CHICAGO With campaign rhetoric becoming increasingly heated and both presidential nominees releasing more attack ads , a new 30 second spot from the Obama campaign this week accuses his opponent Mitt Romney of committing the 1996 murder of 6 year old beauty pageant queen JonBen t Ramsey .Titled " He Did It , " the advertisement asks if anyone can truly remember where Romney was the night of the child ' s murder , and whether the U . S . populace wants a president capable of strangling a little girl and dumping her body in her parents ' basement .President Obama appears at the end of the advertisement to approve the message ." I think this is a fair ad , and I think Mitt Romney owes an explanation to the American people as to why he murdered JonBen t Ramsey , " said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina , who called the commercial ' s black and white reenactment of Mitt Romney carrying a kicking and screaming child to her death " accurate . " " Ultimately , voters need to know who they ' re getting with Mitt Romney : a job and child killing businessman who is so deceitful he won ' t release his tax returns or admit to a senseless murder that shook the nation to its core . "Scheduled to run in multiple swing states , with significant airtime in Ramsey ' s home state of Colorado , the ad criticizes Romney not just for killing the prepubescent girl , but for going to extreme lengths to cover it up . It also states that Mitt Romney paid former school teacher John Mark Karr to falsely come forward as the murderer , and accuses the former Massachusetts governor of being a sex offender .Over a silhouette of Romney walking away from the Ramsey mansion blood dripping from his hands the commercial ' s narrator asks , " If Mitt Romney kept the murder of JonBen t a secret from the American people , what else is he hiding ? "Moreover , at the end of the spot a smiling Romney is seen at a campaign event saying , " I killed her , and I had a good time . " Sources from the Romney campaign were quick to announce that the audio and video had been cobbled together from different statements he made during that particular rally ." Personally , if I killed JonBen t Ramsey , I would have come clean and told the American people that on day one , " Obama ' s communication director David Axelrod said on Sunday ' s installment of Meet The Press . " But I think that ' s a key difference between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney . Barack Obama never murdered a child , and Mitt Romney did . "According to sources at Obama ' s Chicago headquarters , the " He Did It " commercial is just the first in a new series of attack ads that accuses Romney of drowning actress Natalie Wood in 1981 , convincing cult leader David Koresh to burn down the Branch Davidian ranch in Waco , TX , and causing the Challenger disaster ." I think these ads will end up being very effective , " former Bill Clinton campaign strategist Dick Morris said . " If you are an undecided voter and you are constantly seeing images of Mitt Romney standing over a child ' s lifeless body , or , as in the case of the ' Zodiac ' spot , shooting two high schoolers at point blank range on their first date , that ' s a pretty persuasive image right there . "Added Morris , " This ad very effectively reminds us that no child murderer has ever been elected into the White House . "Though the Obama campaign has denied it , many Beltway observers have said the advertisements are retaliation for the Romney camp ' s highly controversial ad , " Boom , " which accuses the president of being the fertilizer bomb that destroyed an Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 . 	 1

Washington The release of over 250 , 000 confidential and classified State Department cables has created a major embarrassment to the Administration . State Department lawyers were unsuccessful in their attempt to have WikiLeaks founder Julian Assinasling reconsider release of the cables .The cables are raw comments about leaders and government officials . Some of the blunt candid leaks concern both friend and foe of the US :President George W . Bush " Had one side of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ' s bra strap off and working on the other when he was massaging her neck at the 2006 G8 Summit . "Iran ' s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , before meeting Western leaders and some Arab leaders , " makes a point of using his right hand when he does a number two . "" He ' s Harry Potter light , " said one of the cables on Prime Minister David Cameron of Great Britain .North Korea ' s Kim Jong Il , " wears tailor fitted adult diapers , made in China , when he hosts Tupperware parties . "At the G 20 Summit in Toronto , President Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper were at urinals next to one another when Harper asked Obama whether he was going to mention the clubbing of baby seals . " The President looked toward Harper and then down , saying , " Ah , probably not Stevie , it would be embarrassing . "King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was " desperate to ' cut off the head of the snake , ' now there are at least 10 , 000 eunuchs in Riyadh alone . "North Korea ' s heir apparent Kim Jong un , " his entourage carries his entire collection of Chia Pets where ever he goes . "Italy ' s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , " the Avon Lady visits his official residence at least twice a week . "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton " got so tongue tied on her first meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy that he tried to untangle it in a ' French way ' .

Football has traditionally been a male preserve but no more , according to a U . S . academic who says social media is helping grow women ' s interest in the sport .Facebook statistics show female interest in teams considered World Cup underdogs such as Iran , Colombia , the U . S and Costa Rica is well over 40 in the number of posts mentioning those countries .Iran received over 472 , 927 social mentions , with 43 of those coming from women , while of the 3 . 25 million mentions relating to Costa Rica , 46 were from female contributors ." The additional attention that social media has given the sport offers women additional outlets to access the tournament that they may not have traditionally had " , says Stacy Torres , a doctoral student in Sociology at New York University ." Now women can follow the games more independently with social media and unprecedented streaming options , " added Torres , an avid Chile fan who has written about the experience of being a Chile fan at the World Cup for New Republic .Of the people talking about Costa Rica ' s 1 0 surprise win over Italy in the group stages , 44 of them were women , while Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina has over 27 , 487 mentions on social media , with 61 of them women ." There was strong engagement among younger women supporting Mexico , specifically mentioning " Chicharito , " Javier Hernandez ' s nickname , who scored the last goal in Mexico ' s game with Croatia , " added a Facebook spokesman .Chile ' s success in the World Cup the South Americans were regarded as unlucky to go out in the last 16 stage after Brazil ' s penalty shootout win has arguably also shown the cultural significance of the tournament ." This is what the World Cup is about , " said Torres . " My father has taught me how to relish Chile ' s flair , energy and heart . Today we feel sad and disappointed but not defeated . For us , they ' ve already won . "Brazil ' s soccer soul : A love too deep to bear ?Julio Cesar : We must not failAnd the World Cup semifinalists will be . . . 	 0
VATICAN CITY The Shroud of Turin , an ancient linen cloth believed to bear the image of Christ and considered by many clerics and devotees to be one of the holiest relics of the Christian faith , was inadvertently dyed a light shade of pink after being washed with a red T shirt , sources reported Tuesday .The holy antiquity , thought by some to be the very garment Jesus Christ was buried in , was discovered in 1354 . Though it has suffered oxidation and fire damage over the centuries , this is the first time that the shroud has been harmed in a laundry related mishap ." Simply because the shroud has been given a slight pinkish tint does not in any way diminish its sanctity , " Vatican spokesman Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo said during a press conference held to address the spiritual repercussions of the shroud ' s staining . " It is still very much the icon of the suffering of the innocent of all times . "The Vatican stressed that nothing out of the ordinary happened to the shroud during the initial preparations for its monthly laundering in Rome . As is custom , on the third Sunday of the month , the priceless relic which is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin , Italy was taken from its hermetically sealed , bulletproof glass case and stuffed into the Blessed Papal Laundry Sack , and it was then transported by a retinue of Swiss Guards to Vatican City without incident .According to Lajolo , the damage occurred when Pope Benedict XVI , whose turn it was to do the Vatican laundry , did not notice that a brand new , bright red Hanes Beefy T belonging to Cardinal Angelo Sodano had been placed inside of the consecrated cleansing vessel , the Holy Whirlpool 24934 top load washer .The pope then started a load of white vestments , including the shroud , only realizing what had happened when he returned to remove the sacred artifact , which is always line dried ." His Holiness was distracted with trying to scrub a tough Blood of Christ stain out of Cardinal Nicora ' s miter , " Lajolo said . " Not that this was some sort of mistake on his part . The pope is still infallible . We have to keep in mind that this is all part of God ' s greater plan . "" And who are we to question or reject the ways the Lord works through our laundry ? " Lajolo continued .Church officials said that the shroud ' s staining was not in any way due to negligence on the Vatican ' s part . An investigation into the matter showed that the detergent had been properly blessed before the laundering , and the holy water softener that was installed last summer was working perfectly ." We must not allow ourselves to fall into despair , for , as sinners , we are flawed and must seek forgiveness in the Lord alone , " said Lajolo , who later hinted that the damage to the shroud was possibly God ' s response to the sins of the world , and especially homosexuality . " As Christ teaches , let he who has never overly starched , shrunk , or rent his garments cast the first stone . "Though the discoloring of the Shroud of Turin has come as a shock to many Catholics , it is not the first time that a holy relic has been damaged . In 1983 , several pieces of the True Cross were water stained after being used as coasters during Pope John Paul II ' s birthday party , and in 1572 , the knucklebone of St . Olaf was accidentally thrown out with a plate of half eaten chicken wings .In the wake of the incident involving Christ ' s death shroud , the Vatican has been exploring possible ways to restore the raiment back to its original color ." We do not want to attempt to use caustic cleaning agents for fear of turning the blessed shroud an unholy bright orange , " Lajolo said . " We continue to look to God for divine guidance as to the purity and virtue of using a color safe bleach . " 	 1
Notorious for his defiance of laws requiring tax for grazing cattle on federal lands , Mr Cliven Bundy has advanced rapidly toward leadership in world affairs .Mr Bundy is now offering to help United States military operations in special circumstances , such as the kidnapping of 230 girls in Nigeria .He claims a rescue brigade is needed , and that if US military forces will supply the transportation he will move his Nevada militias onto the scene and get the girls out of their predicament pronto .Besides , according to a witness on Mr Bundy ' s view of this issue , he sees how these young females can be re directed as part of their rescue ." Hell , we can use wives over here . Lot of my supporters are tired of uppity American women as it is . "Asked how his view contrasts with Boko Harum ' s notions that females should be uneducated , not allowed to drive , and required to be home workers serving males , Mr Bundy paused then delivered this thoughtful response :" Well , that is your basic keep ' em barefoot and pregnant philosophy , which our colleagues in Texas favor . Not here . We don ' t take risks with the delicate female foot . "As to whether the females being Africans ethnically , or brown people and not white , is a concern , the view from the Bundy office is favorable . He and his fellow ranchers would observe a proper work ethic and conditions , as with pre Civil War America , to keep them happy .Also important to Mr Bundy ' s offer is his willingness to provide armed and competent Nevada militias for the fray in Ukraine .These fighters are not mercenaries , it should be pointed out , because they do their work for no pay whatever . Their motivation is the cause , not making a profit .That is , again in the words of Mr Bundy ' s representative , " Them no good commie bastards need a good ass kicking , and always have . "As with Syria , again according to this report on Bundy ' s thinking , joining with former enemies against the currently less popular enemy would be right in line with existing US strategy .If we support al qaeda in Syria why not neo Nazis in Ukraine ?Bundy and his militias have given hard thought to this knotty conundrum to conclude inconsistencies are not important when it comes to handing out a good drubbing to the enemy of the moment .Members of Bundy ' s militias were also interviewed and indicated they didn ' t like sitting around or thinking too much about problems .They compared themselves to waving a red flag at the bull . Anything federal or commie immediately gets their dander up .Additionally , the idea of rescuing a bunch of girls is noble , and might get these females ' appreciation . This could be important because not that many local Nevada women have shown favor for their efforts in defending Mr Bundy . 	 1

TACOMA , WA Having spent years making excuses to avoid socializing with friends and acquaintances , local man Eric Shulman ' s explanations for why he can ' t hang out have grown more and more sophisticated over time , sources confirmed Saturday .Shulman , whose routine brush offs of invitations were once vague and somewhat predictable , now reportedly offers highly detailed , plausible seeming , yet entirely made up reasons for his unavailability anytime a friend asks what he ' s up to this weekend ." Up until a few years ago , Eric would just mutter something like , ' Sorry , but I got this work thing I have to go to , ' if he didn ' t want to come out for a drink , " said Alex Huynh , who has known the 36 year old software analyst since college . " But these days he launches into these complex , multilayered excuses with precise times and places , names of all the people involved , and a complete backstory explaining why it ' s an obligation he can ' t get out of . "" Then the next time you talk to him , he ' ll follow up on his initial fabrication with a carefully constructed second excuse that adds a rich authenticity to what was already a nearly flawless social evasion , " Huynh continued . " The level of detail is truly Dickensian . "Having long ago learned to accept the slim chances of their friend ever actually taking them up on an invitation to hang out , members of Shulman ' s social circle said they have recently acquired a deep appreciation of their friend ' s advanced level of excuse making craftsmanship , which many claimed has become more refined with each passing day .In addition , a number of Shulman ' s friends said recent excuses involving friction with his visiting in laws , as well as a troubling series of migraine headaches he claims to have seen three different doctors about , are light years beyond the crude excuses of " girlfriend issues " and tiredness he once presented regularly ." When I invited him to my birthday party , he immediately launched into this long , involved story about having to get up really early the next morning to work on a Saturday even though they don ' t pay him overtime , and how that ' s bullshit because he ' s been with the same company for five years and he ' s one of their most valuable people , " said close friend Janet Paulson , adding that Shulman later managed to vividly describe his weekend workday later to her , despite the fact that it almost certainly never took place . " He not only created this entire scenario , but somehow became so emotionally invested in his own excuse that he actually appeared to be genuinely upset that his employers were treating him this way . It was a really amazing performance , I ' ve got to say . "" There was a time when he would have just said he had some family shit he had to do and left it at that , " Paulson added . " But Eric is on a whole other playing field now . "Paulson confirmed that Shulman ' s not simply telling her the truth was slightly hurtful on a personal level , but said she was nonetheless eager to know what would take place next in his increasingly dense web of lies , having become engrossed by its thoughtful characterizations and unexpected twists .While Shulman ' s excuses for blowing off friends are often convoluted and seem to have been made up on the spot , those close to him stressed that he in fact goes to great lengths to keep his stories straight ." I ' m convinced he has everything written down somewhere , " said Michael Cueva , another longtime friend . " Last summer he told me he couldn ' t come to my barbecue because he had to fix a leak in his roof . I ' d completely forgotten about it until three months later , when I finally saw him at his place and he pointed to this random part of the ceiling , talking about how he ' d patched the leak , sanded the surface , and carefully matched the paint color so well you couldn ' t even tell it had ever happened . Ingenious stuff . "Cueva also stated that before he left his friend ' s home , Shulman had already laid the groundwork for three or four more excuses he would no doubt use to put off seeing him until well after the New Year ." Usually when people don ' t want to hang out with me , I stop making the effort , but with Eric , I just want to see what he ' s going to say next , " said Cueva , explaining that Shulman really seemed to be going somewhere with his current storyline . " Still , I wish he ' d spend half as much time hanging out as he apparently does inventing reasons why he can ' t . "" I guess the guy has a lot on his plate right now , though , " he added .

Downhome , TX Fearing that the recent ban by Whole Foods on live lobsters could lead to a broader ban on other living foods , the yogurt cultures in Texas formed a marketing coalition to get the message out that they actually want people to eat them .Communicating through a voice synthesis box , the bacteria spokesman called Aci Dophilus said , " You really have to nip this " don ' t eat live stuff " idea in the bud . First they ban live lobsters , the next thing you know it will be anything that has live critters in it . Who thinks up this crap anyway ? "Spokesmen at Whole Foods said they had no plans to ban the sale of yogurt containing live bacteria , but really hadn ' t given the matter much thought .About the ban on live lobsters John Mackey , Whole Foods ' co founder and chief executive , said in a statement " We place as much emphasis on the importance of humane treatment and quality of life for all animals as we do on the expectations for quality and flavor . "The yogurt cultures responded , " Look , we need people to eat us , okay . To be frank , we live in your digestive tracts because it ' s warm , moist and has an ample supply of food . We get really bored just staying in the dairy case all day and would like some better scenery . "Animal rights activists seemed perplexed that the yogurt cultures had gone to the trouble to organize and communicate with humans . " We have a whole new group we can protect now , " said one young woman ." We don ' t need their stinking protection , " the angry bacteria replied . " Look , we inhabited this planet for eons before you people climbed down out of the trees . Granted , you did us a favor by figuring out how to grow us inside yogurt , but let ' s not lose site of the important thing , which is us . We will be here long after you have died from refusing to eat anything that ever was alive . You people would really benefit from a little " food chain 101 study .

kei nishikori became the first japanese male to reach the quarterfinals of the australian open since 1932 when he held on to earn a shock five set win over sixth seed jo wilfried tsonga on monday. nishikori, ranked 26th in the world, blew a two set lead before beating the frenchman for the second time in his career, triumphing 2 6 6 2 6 1 3 6 6 3 in three and a half hours. the 22 year old, who will next face world no. 4 andy murray, beat his previous best grand slam performance reaching the fourth round of the 2008 u. s. open. he is the first japanese male player to reach the last eight of one of the four majors since shuzo matsuoka at wimbledon in 1995. " this is the first quarterfinal for me, " an exhausted nishikori, told reporters after his second successive five set match. " i feel i'm stepping up. it was tough because he was still playing well in the fifth. i was having trouble with making returns. i started getting nervous... but still i was playing aggressive on important points. i was making good serves. so that helped me to get the games. " nishikori beat world no. 1 novak djokovic in the basel semis in october before losing to roger federer, having learned a lesson in his thrashing by murray in the last four in shanghai in his preceding tournament. " he kind of destroyed me. but i have no pressure now. he's one of the players i have to play like him. i learn a lot of things from him. it's going to be tough, but i try to do my best tennis. " nishikori said he hoped he could inspire asian men's players, as china's li na did for the region's women last year by reaching the australian open final and then winning the french open. " it's an honor to make a lot of histories, to be the no. 1 player in japan. but that never gives me pressure, " said nishikori, who is a graduate of the nick bollettieri academy in florida which has produced many top players such as andre agassi, the williams sisters and maria sharapova.. " there's a lot of good players in asia. but, yeah, i'm happy to get to the top from asia, and hopefully i can be like li na for the men. " fourth seed murray, the runner up in melbourne for the last two years, was coasting 6 1 6 1 1 0 against kazakhstan's mikhail kukushkin when the world no. 92 was forced to retire with a left hip flexor injury. " i'll definitely be fresh for the next few rounds hopefully, " said murray, who has yet to win a first grand slam title despite reaching four finals. " i just need to make sure i do the right things the next couple days to get ready for the quarters. " top seed and defending champion novak djokovic survived a spirited third set fightback from former world no. 1 and home crowd favorite lleyton hewitt to seal a 6 1 6 3 4 6 6 3 triumph in the late match. hewitt, granted a wildcard for the tournament after a long fitness struggle has seen him dropped to 181st in the rankings, showed glimpses of the form which took him to two grand slam titles. but djokovic a four time grand slam winner including three major titles in 2011 eventually proved too strong and the serbian world no. 1 eventually saw off the 30 year old hewitt in just under three hours in a match that went past 1 a. m. local time. " i played some loose points and got him back into the match. but credit to him as well for being competitive, for not giving up, " djokovic said. " this is something you can expect from lleyton who is very well known for his fighting spirit. he had the crowd, he had the big support. it got intense. especially the start of the fourth set we had some great rallies. " fifth seed david ferrer awaits djokovic in the next round after the spaniard eased to a 6 4 6 4 6 1 victory against french no. 17 richard gasquet. seventh seed tomas berdych booked his place in the last eight with a four set success against spanish no. 10 nicolas almagro on sunday, but the czech was booed by the hisense arena crowd for refusing to shake his opponent's hand at the end of the match. it followed an incident in the fourth set where berdych accused almagro of purposefully aiming a volley at his face, with the ball striking him on the arm. " whoever has played the tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in, " said berdy 	 0
piers moron just leaked in a rolling stone interview that he'd consider giving up his'wildly'successful show in america to'come home to roost'as head of the bbc. he was non committal when asked if he favoured russell brand to be the face of bbc's comedy division to replace jimmy savile in a popular appeal to regain at least a percentage of the heterosexual audience that have been overlooked in the past decade'or two. " the startling revelation comes after the beeb announced they've run out of replacement chair warmers that would be approved by sally bercow! " you've got to give the audience wot they want, eh, " said piers as he preened at the makeup mirror before air time on the set of his show " don't hang up the phone'where listeners call in for advice, leave a message and he get's back to them in his syndicated news column. as for his'close ties'to rebukah brooks, " well, i haven't talked to her for quite a while since'the troubles ', but i did leave her a few messages on the phone requesting a riding date. sadly she hasn't got back to me yet damn machines are totally unreliable and often delete messages before anyone gets'em! disgrace, really, innit? " piers said he also thought about bringing abroad some of the colony's most successful reality shows that would be good to improve morale in the uk. he said " honey boo b0o ", " pit bulls and parolees, " and " tots with no tits " beauty pageants would probably go over'real big'with fans outside of london. " too many bloody foreigners in the big city to really git it, " he declared. " it's a culture thing i think too tribal to go over big in london with all those pesky diversity issues. " moron ( sic ) said he'd probably go after rudolph murdoch too. " we need to spice up the beeb, and i owe rudolph big time, i'd be going after some of those hot fox presenters and bring them over here to tart up the place a bit. got enough cows in job worth talking positions, no need to look at more of them after coming home from the pub! depressing, innit? " reports from labour indicate they're'all in'behind the idea of bringing in some'new blood'to get the scandal ridden bbc'turned around and right side up ', " although piers may not be the right fit or have the right stature'' said the increasingly diminutive john bercow whose wife sally said she fancies her husband for the job and the chance for her own drama show where she is pitted against smarmy barristers who attempt to sue her arse off for empty headed comments. " i see it as nancy drew takes on a perry mason type of thingy of course nancy isn't gay like perry was, which adds to the drama, " said the aspiring thespian. meanwhile, husband john is said to have had'the sheet'scared out of him due to impending law suits brought against his wife by lord mcalpine for smears coming out of the savile scandal. according to an insider close to pier's creative group, he wants to bring over america's michael moore, oliver stone, and harvey weinstein to contribute their artistry to the beleaguered institution thanks to their approach to documentary presentations favoring continued progressive measures mirroring nick clegg's partisan view of the european union. in addition, said one guardian journalist not currently being sued, they will be instrumental in bringing labour back into power promising to'produce all the news that's fit to print, in our estimation ', a position close to cherie blair's heart which caused her to contact her estate agent and go pile shopping. the conjoined miliband twins now say the bbc'took a blind eye and bent over backwards'to accommodate a number of'presenters'who abused thousands of children and were joined by dozens of parliament members who were confused about their sexuality.'as for the charges ed said, " i can't comment further. if you want to know names, contact sally bercow, she seem to be on top of every one wearing pants at the moment! " cher and chaz bono, john travolta and tom cruise applauded the stand taken by the opposition party saying only, " the conservatives have for too long been the party of straight, out of touch white heterosexuals pressing for stringent penalties against man boy love and backing the ridiculous laws on the age of consent!

russia's military occupation of ukrainian territory on the crimean peninsula constitutes a blatant violation of the commitments that moscow undertook in the 1994 budapest memorandum on security assurances for ukraine. the united states and united kingdom, the other two signatories, now have an obligation to support ukraine and penalize russia. when the soviet union collapsed in 1991, ukraine found itself holding the world's third largest nuclear arsenal, including some 1, 900 strategic nuclear warheads that had been designed to attack the united states. working in a trilateral dialogue with ukrainian and russian negotiators, american diplomats helped to broker a deal the january 1994 trilateral statement under which ukraine agreed to transfer all of the strategic nuclear warheads to russia for elimination and to dismantle all of the strategic delivery systems on its territory. kiev did this on the condition that it receive security guarantees or assurances. the budapest memorandum, signed on december 5, 1994, by the leaders of ukraine, russia, the united states and the united kingdom ( the latter three being the depositary states of the non proliferation treaty, that is, the states that receive the accession documents of other countries that join the treaty ) ) laid out a set of assurances for ukraine. these included commitments to respect ukraine's independence, sovereignty and existing borders to refrain from the threat or use of force against ukraine's territorial integrity and independence and to refrain from economic coercion against ukraine. rubio, cotton : congress must act quickly to punish putinthe memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that ukraine already held from the conference on security and cooperation in europe ( csce ) final act, united nations charter and non proliferation treaty. the ukrainian government nevertheless found it politically valuable to have these assurances in a ukraine specific document. words matter, and a big question at the time arose over whether to use the term " guarantees " or " assurances " in the memorandum. the united states provides guarantees to allies, such as nato member states the term implies a military commitment. in the early 1990s, neither the george h. w. bush administration nor the clinton administration was prepared to extend a military commitment to ukraine and both felt that, even if they wanted to, the senate would not produce the needed two thirds vote for consent to ratification of such a treaty. the budapest memorandum thus was negotiated as a political agreement. it refers to assurances, not defined, but less than a military guarantee. u. s. negotiators myself among them discussed this point in detail with ukrainian counterparts so that there would be no misunderstanding. what is taking place today in crimea can only be described as a russian military occupation. the russian black sea fleet and its associated units have had bases in crimea since 1991, by agreement with ukraine. but the agreement does not allow for the russian military, which has poured thousands of additional troops onto the peninsula over the past several days, to take control of crimea. opinion : putin's ukranian endgamethese russian actions are in blatant violation of the budapest memorandum, as well as russia's commitments under the csce final act and a 1997 bilateral ukraine russia treaty. as signatories, the united states and united kingdom have an obligation to respond, even if they are not obligated to respond with military force. washington and london should act in two ways. first, they should work with other european union member states to support ukraine. that means political engagement, such as secretary of state john kerry's visit today to kiev. they should also assemble a financial package with the international monetary fund to extend credits to ukraine. that can give the country some breathing room as it undertakes critical reforms to put its economic house in order. second, washington and london should work with the european union and others to impose political, diplomatic and economic sanctions on moscow unless and until russia ceases its violation of ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. this has begun. on sunday, the united states, united kingdom, germany, france, italy, canada and japan announced they were suspending preparations to take part in the g8 summit to be hosted in june in sochi by russian president vladimir putin. other steps have been taken, and still others are being planned. the west should aim to impose significant costs on russia that will lead putin to rethink his actions. that likely will prove difficult, but there can be no business as usual with moscow. opinion : how putin carries out power graba strong response is important for settling ukraine's current crisis. it also matters for the cause of nuclear nonproliferation. security assurances were key to bringing kiev to agree to get rid of its nuclear arms. if washington and london don't stand by the budapest memorandum now, it would discredit the idea of such assurances. that would be unfortunate, as security assurances could play a role in defusing nuclear proliferation cases, such as iran. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely 	 0
Patriots : It looks like Tom Brady and anyone healthy enough to play is a formula for success . The Bills worked hard to eliminate Rob Gronkowski , but as usual , other receivers came through . Last Week : 1Panthers : Cam Newton gets the headlines , and he should . He ' s playing great . But this defense is the untold story . The Panthers had five sacks and forced five turnovers that led to 27 points against the Redskins . They ' re not just winning now . They ' re dominating . Last Week : 2Cardinals : Carson Palmer added to his MVP resume last week and the Cardinals are beginning to put a stranglehold on the No . 2 seed in the NFC . Last Week : 3Broncos : Brock Osweiler stepped up to help the Broncos win one on the road . But he ' s going to have to show me more than one win to unseat Peyton Manning , which people are already talking about . The best thing he did was not turn over the ball . That ' s all you need with this defense . Last Week : 7Bengals : Before Bengals fans jump off the cliff , your team went on the road , against one of the best teams in the NFL , took a lead , lost it , came back and nearly won the game . They ' re fine . Last Week : 4Packers : The Packers ran the ball reasonably well , which helped Aaron Rodgers , but the defense stood tall six sacks and a turnover , and held Adrian Peterson to 45 rushing yards . Still , this has to be the new norm . The remaining schedule is not easy . Last Week : 8Seahawks : They rolled up 250 rushing yards without Marshawn Lynch last week . Wins against the Steelers and Vikings the next two weeks will be important for making a playoff run . The Seahawks are 21 4 in November and December since 2012 . Last Week : 5Vikings : Teddy Bridgewater showed incredible toughness in the loss to Green Bay , but the offensive line has to be a concern in the run and pass game at this point . Did the Packers expose what has been a dominant defense ? Last Week : 6Steelers : A healthy Ben Roethlisberger coming off the bye has the Steelers in position for a run . Last Week : 9Giants : Eli Manning and the offense have carried the load . The defense must make stops if the Giants are going to hang on in the suddenly very tight NFC East . Last Week : 10Colts : I ' ve asked before , and I ' ll ask it again . Is this team better with Matt Hasselbeck ? Right now , the Colts might be . Last Week : 15Chiefs : What a great job by the Chiefs pulling out of that hole they were in . Four straight wins , and a 4 2 conference record has this team back in the hunt , and a win this week against the Bills will help their playoff push . Last Week : 18Bills : The Bills are a very competitive team and will be in the playoff picture to the end as a wild card candidate . Last Week : 11Falcons : I expected more from the Falcons coming out of their bye week . Matt Ryan is playing uncharacteristically bad , and it ' s hard to lose to Blaine Gabbert and Matt Hasselbeck and be a playoff team . Last Week : 12 	 0
Criminals are being locked up for longer as the government keeps its promise to be tough on those who break the law , new figures show .Convictions of celebrity sex abusers are believed to be partly responsible for a larger number of sex offenders being prosecuted , as victims feel more confident about coming forward to expose their abusers .The average jail term now stands at 15 1 2 months , three months longer than the average in 2004 , and prisoners are getting longer sentences now than they have done for 20 years , Ministry Of Justice MOJ ) figures reveal .Jailed celebrities : Rolf Harris , 84 , left , and Stuart Hall , 84 , right , were both jailed for indecently assaulting girlsA source close to Justice Minister Chris Grayling told MailOnline : ' Criminals who break the law and ruin the lives of decent hardworking people have to realise they will go to prison .' A slap on the wrist isn ' t acceptable for those who make others ' lives a misery . 'The average custodial sentence length ( ACSL ) , or length of time people are sentenced to , has increased year on year over the last decade , according to the MOJ ' s new criminal justice statistics update .The new figures , which don ' t include life or indeterminate sentences , show that while fines are the most commonly given punishment by all courts , offenders who are sent to jail are facing a longer period inside , particularly sex offenders .Criminals jailed for sex offences are jailed for longer than any others , with an average sentence of 58 . 7 months . The custody rate for these offenders is also up , with 60 per cent of those convicted of sex offenders being sent to prison , second only to robbers , of whom 64 per cent are jailed .This is thought to be due in part to an increase in the number of celebrity sex offenders being convicted for abuse giving victims confidence to come forward .In the last year alone , celebrity publicist Max Clifford , broadcaster Stuart Hall and former children ' s television presenter Rolf Harris have all been jailed for sex offences .In July , Rolf Harris was jailed for five years and nine months after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults against four girls .The 84 year old artist and children ' s presenter was jailed by Mr Justice Sweeney , who told him he had taken advantage of his celebrity and had shown ' no remorse ' .A source close to justice secretary Chris Grayling , left , says people convicted of serious crimes , like publicist and sex offender Max Clifford , 71 , right , will face prison sentences rather than a ' slap on the wrist 'Former It ' s A Knockout presenter Stuart Hall was sentenced to 30 months in jail after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of 20 years .Earlier this year , the 84 year old was jailed for a further 30 months after admitting indecently assaulting an under age girl .But the judge told him he would have received a ' considerably greater ' sentence had he been prosecuted under current laws .Under his first sentence , Hall would have been due for early release this month at the earliest , but now he will not be eligible for parole until December 2015 .Celebrity publicist Max Clifford , 71 , was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984 .The sentence imposed by Judge Anthony Leonard was far longer than expected , partly , the judge said , because of his ' quite extraordinary ' attitude during the trial , in which he was seen laughing and shaking his head as evidence was given .Clifford was told that had some of offences been tried under today ' s law , they would have been considered as rape or assault by penetration with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .The tide of celebrity sex abuse cases is thanks to Operation Yewtree , a national police investigation into decades old sex crimes perpetrated by television icons such as the late Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter .The government has introduced automatic life sentences for anyone who commits a second violent or sexual offence , ensuring the most serious criminals are dealt with severely .The justice minister has said he wants criminals to know that a serious offence will earn them a jail sentence rather than a caution .Mr Grayling is currently pushing a bill through parliament to ensure that criminals will no longer receive cautions for serious offences , and for less serious offences they will no longer receive a second caution for the same or similar offence committed in a two year period . 	 0

orrville, oh the national pastime of eating delicious, reasonably priced snack food items between meals was made more fun monday, when the j. m. smucker company introduced smucker's super snackers '. the new product, which differs from ordinary smucker's snackers'due to the inclusion of new " magic " color change sprinkles, is expected to propel already soaring national snacktime fun levels to unprecedented heights by mid spring. " i can't believe how much fun i'm having! " said boston resident and longtime snack enthusiast lance petersen, lovingly sprinkling the exciting granules over his plastic tray container of jelly and, using the enclosed plastic rectangular spreading tool, smoothing the resultant multicolored substance across a cracker. " look at the colors! thanks to these amazing new sprinkles, the jelly is changing right before my very eyes almost as if by some sort of magic! " " wow! " agreed salem, or, snacker kathleen naistadt, taking a bite out of a combination cracker peanut butter color altered jelly food morsel she assembled all by herself. " this is fun! " snacktime, the traditional occasion set aside daily by americans for recreational, non hunger motivated bite sized food consumption, has always been fun and carefree. but, according to snack industry insiders, the new super snackers'pb j deluxe snak paks have taken that fun to a whole new level, providing eaters not only with traditional smell and taste based entertainment, but enjoyable visual stimuli, as well. in the process, snack experts say, smucker's has created a " total snack experience, " one that all but renders obsolete lesser snacktime diversions previously thought to be " fun. " " this new product has set the snacking world on its ear, calling into question our most basic notions of what snacktime is and should be, " said dr hans volstein, director of harvard university's prestigious l. warren pringle snacketerium. " it is not going too far to suggest that snacktime will never be the same. " snack industry observers are predicting record sales figures for the snack, which has already made the j. m. smucker company the front runner for the 1999 snacky awards. but for all the notoriety, dr walter tolson, the smucker's scientist chiefly responsible for the development of the new product, remains humble : the addition of " magic " color changing sprinkles'to the already successful snackers'product line, he said, was " all in a day's work. " " when we were developing the super snackers, people said to us,'but you already have smucker's snackers ', and people love them. why mess with success?'" said tolson, speaking from his office at smuckerlabs. " but that's just not the way we do things here at smucker's. even if we have a popular product, we keep pushing the envelope by adding that extra'super'prefix to it. its all part of our commitment to providing the american consumer with the most enjoyable snacktime experience science will allow. " " taste alone is not enough, " tolson continued. " in today's competitive snack marketplace, snackers demand more. they don't merely want to eat. they want to be entertained by what they eat, while they eat it. " across the nation, snackers are responding to tolson's bold snacktime vision. " this fun, interactive, pre processed food item represents a whole new way of snacking, " said minneapolis resident sandra hirsch. " if the sprinkles came already mixed in, that'd be boring. but by enclosing the " magic " color changing sprinkles in a separate, sealed plastic packet, smucker's has given me the opportunity to actively participate in the snacktime process tearing open the sprinkles envelope, peeling back the jelly packet's cover seal, mixing in the sprinkles, and watching the two snack components fuse in a snacktacular explosion of color, a snack experience greater than the sum of its parts. " what's more, hirsch's children, ashley, 3, and brandon, 5, are able to join in the fun. the new sprinkles are so easy to tear open, pour and mix, consumers of all ages can enjoy the new, more fun version of snacktime, even those who possess only the most rudimentary of motor skills. " just look at them, " hirsch said, watching her children rip open their snak paks with glee. " for them, smucker's has unlocked the door to a veritable snack food valhalla. " smuck 	 1

This reporter has had the ultimate trill in being a part of a national search for the last remaining Champion Disco Skater .Known nationally as " Disco Dan " , Dan slipped into obscurity after gaining national attention as the most Disco of all Disco Skaters . During his reign as the Disco King , Dan was known to frequent rink upon rink demonstrating his technique to astonished viewers who made such comments as , " Wow , dig that cat ' s crazy moves ! " and " I wish I had me some skates like those ! "After searching public records for more than a decade , this discovery team stumbled across a police blotter in Las Vegas , Nevada listing one Dan W . as having been arrested for creating a public disturbance by skating up to single females and asking bizarre questions . The report went on to say Mr W , attempted to use the Temporary Insanity plea to keep from paying the 10 fine , which cast even more suspicion his way .Following this lead , the team discovered 42 similar arrests with similar pleadings by Mr W . Once asking the unsuspecting female to " Sniff my Boogie Skates ! " This was the final clue which lead directly to the residence of Disco Dan himself !Knocking upon the door of the last known address for Dan W . , this reporter could hardly contain his anticipation at once again seeing a true Disco Skate Master .Upon answering the door , Dan was attired in a white Polyester jumpsuit silver sequined shoes with a gold razor blade necklace as his single piece of jewelry . Dressed like a true disco star , the only belying fact was the withered , wrinkled , Picture of Dorean Gray like appearance of Dan who obviously hadn ' t aged well ." What took you guys so long ? " , asked Dan , " I ' ve been waiting for over thirty years ! "Dan went on to say , " I ' ve been practicing daily and am as good as ever despite being hassled by ' The Man ' on a regular basis ! "This reporter must add the meeting was less than optimum and Dan ' s refusal to stop blathering about Disco it ' s importance in cultural progress was of great concern . So much so , in fact , this reporter came to the conclusion either Mr W was on powerful drugs , or needed to be placed on powerful drugs .And so there you have it , the last of the Red Hot Disco Skaters found in Las Vegas , Nevada , alone , confused and in need of the services of a qualified psychiatrist . 	 1
Bobby Zamora admits the big clubs must be crazy if they ' re not considering a swoop for his Queens Park Rangers strike partner Charlie Austin .Austin has 12 goals in 16 games in his first Barclays Premier League campaign and , with the transfer window about to open , Rangers are desperately trying to extend his contract aware that his goals could be the difference between survival and relegation .' As a club , we need to tie him down and get him a new deal , ' said Zamora . ' Without a doubt other clubs will be looking at him and if they ' re not they ' re crazy because he can get you that goal .Bobby Zamora appeals for time wasting from Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech SzczesnyCharlie Austin celebrates scoring a second half penalty for QPR at Arsenal on Boxing Day FridayAustin ( centre ) tries to dribble past Rosicky ( left ) , as Rangers fell to a ninth straight Premier League win' He did well for us last year and even though it ' s been a step up we know what he can do .' He wasn ' t scoring wonder goals , going past four or five people they ' re striker ' s goals , finisher ' s goals and if you ' ve got that ability , you can do it at any level . 'Like Austin , Zamora took the scenic route from non League to the top flight . ' It ' s a great route and a great story , ' added the 33 year old . ' It gives you extra hunger . It ' s brilliant and I ' m pleased for him .

At least 31 people were killed and nearly 300 injured on Friday in the bloodiest day in the Libyan capital since the fall of Tripoli in 2011 , according to figures released by the government .Fighting broke out after protesters marched on the Tripoli headquarters of militias from the coastal city of Misrata .Protesters and eyewitnesses said militiamen opened fire on the hundreds who marched on Gharghour , a southern district of the capital where Misrata militia are based , in an effort to evict the armed groups .TV footage aired on the privately owned al Nabaa channel showed militiamen , in what appeared to be an antiaircraft cannon mounted on a truck , opening fire directly at protesters .The situation escalated into an armed confrontation that lasted for hours as protesters returned with weapons and militiamen from different parts of the capital .The sound of heavy gunfire , artillery and explosions echoed across Tripoli after nightfall .The scene at Tripoli ' s overwhelmed hospitals was one of chaos and grief , as women wailed and a constant stream of ambulances delivered injured men , women and children ." The scenes in trauma hospitals across Tripoli resembled a war zone tonight : frantic health staff rushing to provide help , armed men nervously patrolling corridors , and families desperately trying to find their loved ones " Said Hanan Salah , a Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch , who visited a number of the capital ' s main hospitals .In a statement released on Friday night , the Libyan government described the protest as a " peaceful " event that came under fire when it entered Gharghour ." The government asked the people to go out and protest across the country to reject armed brigades in cities , especially in Tripoli . We salute the peaceful protest that came out today , it was an unarmed protest that had obtained the government ' s permission " the statement said .A commander of a Misrata militia speaking by phone to state TV claimed that protesters had opened fire first and one militiaman was killed from gunshots he said came from nearby rooftops .Al Taher Basha Agha said the armed groups had agreed to leave the capital once the country ' s constitution was passed , but Friday ' s violence had changed their position ." By God , we will not leave , we will only leave in our coffins , " the commander said .Militiamen from Misrata and a number of other Libyan cities came into Tripoli during the fight for the capital in August 2011 and have created bases in different parts of the capital where they have remained since .Friday ' s protest partly organized by the Tripoli Local Council comes after heavy fighting in the heart of the capital last week between the Misrata militiamen and other groups from Tripoli .Anger against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other Libyan parts of the country , including the eastern city of Benghazi that has been gripped by increasing violence , including political assassinations .Libya ' s weak central government has not been able to rein in militia groups with various regional , tribal and political loyalties . The government has been struggling with its plans to build an army and police . Many militia are on the state ' s payroll but continue to operate freely , with no government control .Last month , Prime Minister Ali Zaidan was kidnapped by a militia in the capital and released a few hours later by another militia .Tensions were running high in Tripoli on Friday night and many Libyans were concerned that the violence could be the start of further unrest after grieving families bury their dead on Saturday . 	 0
Exploitation : Insurance fraudster Shoaib NawazA crackdown on whiplash fraud has led to a 10 per cent fall in the number of motor insurance injury claims , figures reveal today .This has seen the cost of motoring personal injury claims by controversial companies cashing in on them plummet by 33 per cent from 354million to 238million , a report by industry watchdogs says .The 116million reduction the first in a decade follows legal changes last year and a cull of claims management companies , whose numbers have fallen by 35 per cent to 1 , 214 .' There appears to be a correlation between these drops , ' the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries says . As a result , it adds , the cost of average third party motor insurance premiums has fallen by nearly a fifth .The report says : ' The number of claims management companies has now halved from its peak of more than 2 , 500 in 2011 and stands at levels last seen at the end of 2007 . 'The crackdown last year came after MPs on the all party transport select committee condemned the motor insurance claims system as ' dysfunctional ' , making Britain ' the whiplash capital of Europe ' because of widespread fraud .The targets of the crackdown included ' crash for cash ' gangs such as the one run by Mohammed Omar Gulzar , 31 , who devised at least 39 collisions across South Yorkshire to claim up to 500 , 000 from insurance companies .Working with actors and the fraudulent company City Claims 4 U , Gulzar filed dozens of claims for injuries such as whiplash .On one occasion , he and his employee Shoaib Nawaz , 25 , filled a single decker bus with co conspirators , before driver Adam Herbert who was in on the plot deliberately crashed into a Vauxhall Zafira . Afterwards , 25 people made claims for whiplash .In January , Gulzar and Nawaz were jailed for four and a half and three and a half years respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies . Herbert , 26 , was jailed for 20 months .The IFoA has long expressed concern about ' discrepancies ' showing that while the number of damage claims was falling , those for personal injury were soaring .But David Brown , one of the authors of the new report , said : ' Legal changes in 2013 appear to have had a significant impact on motor insurance injury claims . 'Pain : Whiplash claims dropped last year from 354m to 238m , said the report by watchdogs ( posed by model )The biggest changes were those imposed under the Legal Aid , Sentencing and Punishment Offenders Act , which slashed the fees that could be earned by ' no win , no fee ' legal firms .The Government announced last October that whiplash cheats would be targeted by independent medical panels considering evidence only from accredited doctors so that ' people can no longer profit from exaggerated or fraudulent compensation claims ' .Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said this would help ' turn the tide on the compensation culture ' .Referal fees paid by lawyers , insurers and claims firms have also been outlawed . Claims firms have been banned from rewarding individuals who bring them business , and the maximum that lawyers can charge for handling uncontested minor injury claims has been slashed from 1 , 200 to 500 , removing a key incentive to settle without asking too many questions .Mr Brown said : ' The motor insurance industry anticipated the impact of legal changes and has already passed on the reduction in costs to consumers . 'Simon Douglas , director of AA Insurance , said that while the reforms had put ' downward pressure ' on premiums , ' too many people are tempted to make a claim knowing that whiplash injury is extremely difficult to disprove ' .He added : ' Government intervention to further toughen up the legal processes could help prevent the otherwise inevitable .

The 34 year old held a press conference in Grand Central Station in NYC yesterday to let the world know of his plans .Awaiting the start of the press conference , the crowd was entertained by the dulcet tones of the late Johnny Cash singing " A Boy Named Sue . "When Mr Cliff stepped up to the podium , he told the crowd that he ' s never understood why his parents chose " Fiscal " as his first name . With a shrug , he said , " Don ' t blame me . It wasn ' t my choice . " Up until recently , though , the name never bothered him , and his nickname " Fizz " suited him just fine .But things changed , he said , in late 2012 when threat of a " fiscal cliff " confused and enraged many in the United States . Mr Cliff , who claims to be a totally innocent bystander , became the recipient of hate mail and anonymous phone calls filled with curses and threats . On several occasions , he was pelted with rotten tomatoes when he ventured out of the house . Rain or shine , he took to wearing a long raincoat and carrying an umbrella when he appeared in public ." It ' s just not fair , " Mr Cliff whined to the crowd . " Politicians created this mess , but everybody is blaming me . "He explained that he plans to keep his last name and just change the first one . Among the names he ' s considering ( the why is shown in parentheses ) are : Cliff ( " Cliff Cliff may sound like a stutter , but it has a nice simple ring to it " ) , Barack ( " Barack Cliff is kinda presidential " ) , Clinton ( " The double C in Clinton Cliff has lots of panache . " )One listener , sprinting toward the exit of the train station , shouted , " I , for one , am not buying his claim of being total innocent in creating the mess we ' re in . " He took the opportunity to accentuate his words by slinging a few rotten tomatoes in the direction of Mr Cliff ' s baggie wrapped head .Ah , democracy ! Ain ' t it grand ? 	 1
The usually upbeat face of evangelical agony aunt Claire Rayner was downcast today at a press conference where she decried the theft of her glass eye collection from her home in Windsor . She stated that the collection , which was ordinarily stored in a tailor made mahogany cabinet with glass presentation drawers , had always been popular with guests and visitors and had drawn a wide range of compliments and praise whenever she had made it available for public viewing .Police believe the items have been stolen to order and are possibly already out of the country , although customs officials nevertheless remain hopeful of intercepting the goods before they are transported overseas . This was a well planned operation , with very little left to chance or luck ' , stated WPC Germaine Hanmedown , It seems likely that the main target was the so called egret blue that used to belong to the Duke of Devonshire before his quad bike accident in the early 1970s . It was a one off , a collector ' s piece , and was fiercely bid for when it came on the market in 1983 . 'Originally thought lost after the accident that saw off the Duke , the egret blue was recovered just three days later when it was passed ' by his loyal dog , Buddy . It is believed that the great Dane , who discovered his master ' s mangled body in a ditch , had licked his face so vigorously in an attempt to revive him that he had dislodged and then accidentally swallowed the glass eye .In relation to the theft , early speculation turned to Andrew Lloyd Webber , who is known to be very keen on the egret blue as it is similar in colour to the haunting , psychopathic eyes of his cellist brother Julian their colour apparently having been inherited from the brothers ' biological mother , Carry On ' actress , Hattie Jacques , who died in 1988 .Lloyd Webber had been heard to drool excitedly over the egret blue , which would cause him to involuntarily rub his hands together and hunch forward like a giant toad boy , and has often remarked that he considers it the most finely crafted eye of his generation .However , lawyers for Lloyd Webber quickly stepped in to deny any conspiracy on his part and Rayner herself stated that Lloyd Webber was above suspicion , Andrew would never , I said never , do such a thing , he is a driven and motivated man but he knows how much I loved those eyes , particularly the egret blue , darling , and he wouldn ' t be so vindictive as to move in on them . 'Police are following up the investigation through the appropriate channels and have been asking dealers and traders in the area to contact them immediately if they see anything suspicious . In the meantime , Rayner has consoled herself with the knowledge that her collection of Victorian gynaecological instruments remain untouched , as do her collection of false teeth , one set of which are rumoured to have belonged to Gerald Ford .Looking on the bright side , Rayner commented that , although her darling ' eyes were irreplaceable and she would probably never again see them rocking and rolling in the draw as they looked up at her , she would continue to collect beautiful objects with the insurance money , a portion of which she was setting aside as part of her long running bid to purchase Prince Albert ' s infamous cock ring . Its not just a fable ' , Rayner added , it ' s really a piece of history , a document of the past , and , with a little spit and polish , it could easily be turned into a collector ' s item that everyone will want to get their hands on .

" The van can transmit a map of contaminated areas to the station for broadcast . That way , Fox 11 viewers gain valuable minutes time which could be used to plan escape routes , call loved ones , and gather survival supplies . "A Fox 11 News promotional spot features footage of the van driving down Murfreesboro thoroughfares while flashing its trademark Terror Alert Warning Light , which informs Murfreesboro citizens of the current Homeland Security Advisory System terror threat level .

Stay ahead of the game with Fox 11 .

When it comes to keeping me and my loved ones safe , Fox 11 is ' on the case ! ' " said Murfreesboro resident Ed Nelson , expressing his enthusiasm about the new van to a Channel 11 camera crew . " Seeing the Fox News terror alert van parked in front of the credit union or driving through the Piggly Wiggly parking lot makes me feel secure . "Nelson , who will appear in an upcoming local Channel 11 advertisement , waved his index finger and added : " Fox 11 News is number one in central Tennessee ! "Bogert ended the conference with some tough words for terrorists ." Terrorists better think twice before targeting the good citizens of the greater Murfreesboro area , " Bogert said . " Terrorists , if you ' re watching , I have one thing to say to you : If you attack , the Fox 11 News team will be on the scene just minutes later . "Though Channel 11 currently has the only anti terrorism news van in the country , plans are underway to use the concept at Fox affiliates nationwide . 	 1
An Al Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi , Libya , becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war , the network reported Saturday .Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi , an opposition stronghold in the east , from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when " unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in , " Al Jazeera reported on its English language website .The cameraman and another person were wounded . Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital , but did not survive , the network said ." Al Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime , which comes as part of the Libyan regime ' s malicious campaign targeting Al Jazeera and its staff , " the network reported .A civil war has broken out between forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement .Since the start of the revolt last month , the government has kept a close eye on journalists . Reporters in Tripoli have been given minders and , in some cases , prevented from covering protests .The Committee to Protect Journalists said Friday it has documented more than 40 attacks on the media in Libya since February . They include 25 detentions , four assaults , two attacks on news facilities , the jamming of transmissions , and the interruption of internet service , the New York based advocacy group said .Several journalists have also reported the confiscation of their equipment , it added ."

The statements came amid claims by Afghan officials that the Obama administration offered to write the letter as part of an effort to keep a small number of U . S . troops in Afghanistan well past the 2014 deadline to withdraw ." Quite the contrary , we have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgents and al Qaeda . So that ( letter of apology ) is not on the table . "Rice said she has seen news reports but has no idea where they are coming from , describing the claims as a " complete misunderstanding of what the situation is . "The claim first surfaced following talks Tuesday between U . S . Secretary of State John Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , when Karzai ' s spokesman told reporters that Kerry said President Barack Obama would write an official letter guaranteeing the United States would not repeat " past mistakes " that led to civilian casualties .Asked later about such a letter , State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said , " I don ' t have anything to tell you about whether there will or won ' t be a letter . "The conversation between Karzai and Kerry came ahead of a meeting of Afghan leaders known as a Loya Jirga to potentially sign off on a deal that would allow a limited number of American troops to stay to train Afghan security services .Kerry declined an invitation to attend to the Loya Jirga , but offered to write a letter to the leaders offering U . S . assurances about a future security relationship , said two senior U . S . officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity .The letter Kerry offered would also clarify the U . S . position on past issues , such as civilian casualties and a pledge to do everything possible to avoid them , said one of the officials .But the letter in no way would be offered as an apology , both officials said .White House spokesman Jay Carney said a " general agreement " between the two countries was reached last month . There have been talks in the weeks since " to finalize the text , " he said .Opium poppy cultivation rises to new levels in AfghanistanRice said the United States was in the last stages of negotiations on a framework that Kerry and Karzai signed off on last month during talks ." Without such an agreement , that level of cooperation would be all but impossible . "Karzai ' s office issued a statement spelling out some points of contention , including the Afghan government ' s opposition to raids " on any Afghan homes by U . S . forces , " while Washington wants to be able to conduct such operations " in exceptional circumstances . "According to the statement , Karzai proposed two alternatives :Have Kerry himself make the case for military raids when the Loya Jirga convenes later this weekDon ' t sign any bilateral security agreement until a new Afghan government takes shape after the upcoming presidential election , set for next AprilKarzai agrees to new deadline for prison handoverCarney acknowledged military raids were an issue , calling them a matter of concern for both countries .U . S . troops were deployed to Afghanistan following the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the country .Obama has vowed to reduce U . S . troop levels in Afghanistan , with the goal to end the U . S . combat mission by the end of 2014While the final numbers could change , a senior Defense Department official said it ' s not likely to change by much . If fewer than 8 , 000 were to stay , relatively few would be able to engage in actual missions .Obama signals Afghan war ' s next chapter 	 0
BELFAST , NORTHERN IRELAND The Irish Republican Army announced Monday that it will embark on the most aggressive campaign of violence in its history if McDonald ' s Shamrock Shakes are not made available year round ." The Shamrock Shake is a frosty , minty symbol of all that we hold dear , " said Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political wing . " It is shameful that we as a people cannot enjoy this proud , symbolic beverage any more than one week a year . "" Unless the British government loosens its iron grip on this most Irish of shakes , " Adams continued , " the streets will once again run red with English blood . "British Prime Minister John Major refused to give in to the IRA demands . " The extremist threats of these people are unconscionable , " Major said in an impassioned speech before Parliament . " The Shamrock Shake is only avaliable for a limited time . "" Having to endure this appalling shake once a year is bad enough , " House of Lords member Edward Shropshire Fentwick said . " It will be a black day in England indeed when the Irish masses are free to have their barbaric shake whenever and wherever they want it . "In addition to year round Shamrock Shake availability , the IRA called for the immediate release of the infamous " Shake Seven . " Imprisoned since 1983 in connection with the bombing of a McDonald ' s Anglican Apple shake mix factory in Manchester , the radical Shamrock Shake activists maintain their innocence to this day ." If fighting on behalf of what one believes in is a crime , then let us all hang , " said Liam O ' Fachna , the group ' s leader , from his cell in Birmingham Jail . " Shamrock Shakes forever . "The IRA also demanded that the delicious , Irish Catholic themed shakes be available at all restaurants , not just at participating McDonald ' s . " No single restaurant chain should have control over our delicious , frosty heritage , " Adams said .Though a connection has not been confirmed , Monday ' s IRA announcement coincided with an explosion at a British bank in Long Strand , an East Belfast enclave of Protestant vanilla shake drinkers . In addition , a truck carrying Alpine Raspberry shake mix McDonald ' s next scheduled specialty flavor was overturned in the Ardoyne neighborhood of Belfast .In a videotaped statement from an IRA safehouse somewhere near Belfast , Uncle O ' Grimacey , the most radical member of the Grimace family , demanded the immediate loosening of Shamrock Shake restrictions throughout Northern Ireland . " Release the shakes to us at once , " O ' Grimacey said , " or the lives of your children will be forfeit . "McDonald ' s shake representative Grimace was quick to distance himself from his IRA member uncle . " All shakes in their time is my watchword , and certain flavors all year , " Grimace said . " O ' Grimacey is a radical Grimace acting without the approval of the McDonald ' s corporation . "The Shamrock Shake was banned in Northern Ireland until 1920 , when Parliament finally voted to allow its consumption once a year , during the week of St . Patrick ' s Day . Between 1968 and 1994 , more than 3 , 000 were killed in shake related violence , including some 350 deaths during the " Minty March " Riots of 1974 .According to Irish legend , the Shamrock Shake first appeared when a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of St . Matthew ' s Cathedral in Belfast cried a 16 ounce quantity of the green beverage in 1605 . 	 1
Harry Potter star Alan Rickman dies aged 69LONDON : Veteran British actor Alan Rickman , a master of playing menacing screen villains , has died at the age of 69 after suffering from cancer , his family said Thursday .The Golden Globe and BAFTA winning film , television and theatre star possessed a rich , smooth voice and brooding delivery that helped make him a sex symbol as well as an archetypal " baddie " actor ." The actor and director Alan Rickman has died from cancer at the age of 69 . He was surrounded by family and friends , " a family statement said .Rickman started out in British theatre and shot to international fame in 1988 playing opposite Bruce Willis as the German terrorist mastermind Hans Gruber in " Die Hard " .Rickman did a memorable turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham in the 1991 blockbuster " Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves " .His performance earned him the best supporting actor gong at Britain ' s BAFTA film awards ." This will be a healthy reminder to me that subtlety isn ' t everything , " he said , on receiving the award ." In Nottingham , we ' ll always remember Alan Rickman in his role as the sheriff and are so sad to hear of his death , " said Mohammed Saghir , current holder of the now ceremonial post ." His sheriff was a gloriously nasty character who it was easy to love to hate and who he appeared to have great fun playing . "Rickman also won a best actor award at the Golden Globes and the Emmys for the title role in the television film " Rasputin : Dark Servant of Destiny " ( 1996 ) .But he gained legions of younger fans with his portrayal of the largely malicious teacher Severus Snape in all eight " Harry Potter " films from 2001 to 2011 .Potter ' s creator J .

FORT WORTH , TX Filling the voids of loneliness present in their respective lives , Robert P . Hughes High School science teacher Lorraine Belmont , 33 , and sophomore Matthew Clark , 16 , have reportedly begun a sexual relationship that observers have described as being actually somewhat endearing ." I guess I should be weirded out by the fact that my teacher is getting it on with one of my classmates , but I have to admit , it ' s kind of adorable , " said sophomore Stephanie Elmore , who is in Belmont ' s honors chemistry class . " They both seemed so aimless and lonely that we were all , in a way , just really glad they found each other . "" They ' re a perfect match , frankly , " Elmore added .Faculty sources described Belmont as a sweet woman , if a bit high strung and plain looking , who in the past has dated sporadically at best . Clark , meanwhile , has been characterized by his peers as a deeply introverted student who , while rarely bullied , never had many friends and was " just sort of there . "But during the school ' s summer session , Belmont was spotted dropping Clark off a few blocks from campus a number of times , and Clark has reportedly skipped Spanish class on several occasions in order to see Belmont during her planning period , an occurrence that witnesses described as being " undeniably heartwarming to watch . "Despite the ethical problems Belmont and Clark ' s relationship may pose , members of the school community said the clandestine affair is probably the best thing for the both of them ." We were all worried Lorraine would never find anyone , " algebra teacher Willa Myers said . " My first impulse was to be upset about what she was doing , but the more I thought about it , the more the whole thing just made sense . "" She seems so much more upbeat these days , " Myers added . " She ' s even wearing lipstick . "Clark ' s peers told reporters they have seen a notable shift in his personality since he began the relationship with his teacher ." Matt really seems a lot more confident , " junior Brian Marshall said . " He ' s got this glow about him I ' ve never seen before . And , honestly , good for him . Maybe this will give him the validation he needs . "While unable to publicly congratulate Belmont and Clark on their relationship , students and faculty have privately been giddy with excitement about the couple , with even the school ' s administrators struggling to hide their smiles when they notice Belmont and Clark sneaking off during school assemblies ." Every rule in the book says I should fire Ms . Belmont for abusing the teacher student relationship , but it ' s honestly just too charming of a story , " said the school ' s principal , Marcus Wallace . " Of course , there is a 17 year age difference , but I challenge anyone to watch the two of them stare at each other from across the gym during a pep rally and tell me that true love isn ' t real . "Students even found it " kind of great " when Clark accidentally called Belmont " baby " in class last week , a slip of the tongue they said would have been creepy under any other circumstances , but just felt really sweet in that moment .At press time , students and faculty had cleared out of the school cafeteria to give the happy couple some privacy . 	 1

After demolishing a third dressing room in recent weeks , Australian international cricketer Daniel Christian has been suspended by his state team South Australia .His latest violent outburst was thought to be as a consequence of another poor performance by Christian but he ' s now revealed the real reason behind his temper tantrum .Christian told reporters , " It ' s not my poor performances or the teams disappointing run that made me lose my rag again . Frankly I ' ve come to the conclusion that I ' ve wasted my life playing this stupid game . I ' ve had enough of all the daft terminology . Googlies , leg breaks , silly mid this silly mid that . It ' s all a bloody waste of time . No one takes cricket seriously . You can stick the game up your arse . "Ironically he is now responsible for a new cricket term , " Christianing . " Meaning " to smash up a dressing room in a fit of rage .

He said , " I reckon he ' s frustrated with his and the teams performances . It ' s understandable really . I used to get quite annoyed when I got out . I even used the word damn once and told a team mate to " stuff off . " I ' m not proud of that outburst . He should take some time away from the game . In the cold light of day he ' ll realise that he ' s right , cricket is a waste of time but what else can he do ? He talks about becoming an airline pilot but imagine if he got his landing a bit wrong . He ' d smash the bloody cockpit up . I don ' t think Qantas would be too happy with that . Stick with cricket fella , that ' s my advice . "Meanwhile , Sheila Redback , who owns the only company in Australia that specialises in fixing wrecked cricket dressing rooms , is devasted . " It ' s the only business we ' ve had in years . He ' s got to keep on playing and getting out cheaply . Selfish bugger . " 	 1
RAJASTHAN , India Some call him the River Maker , others the Rainman of Rajasthan . His real name is Rajendra Singh . His nicknames come from his self imposed mission to solve his state ' s water problems , one raindrop at a time .Rajendra Singh is trying to solve water issues in Rajasthan one of India ' s driest states ." Today with global warming and climate change so many things are going on . Yes , this is the global problem . This is the modern problem . The solution is indigenous water conservation , " Singh says .Singh lives and works in Rajasthan , one of the driest states in India .It is the country ' s largest state in land mass but has only about one percent of the country ' s water resources .Singh has spent the last 25 years of his life practicing what he preaches there . His message is always the same . He says rainwater is a resource we cannot afford to waste , instead we should capture and utilize it ." If the drops come from the cloud , we can catch it ! " He says with his hands stretched to the sky . " And that drop go es into the under ground aquifer and fulfills the aquifer . If that drop comes back so it will make springs , make a river . "We caught up with him in Rajasthan ' s Alwar district . One of India ' s so called " princely states " once ruled by Indian royalty .Back in the 1980s the government declared the area a dark zone : An area villagers could no longer pump up clean water because the water table had gotten so low ." When there was a famine there was a drought I had to leave . " Farmer Narin Joshi told us who has lived in the area his whole life ." I had to work as a laborer in Delhi to make ends meet . There was no way I could earn any money here . I had to go . "That meant leaving his wife behind to raise their children and try to keep them fed ." If there is a harvest we benefit from the farm . " His wife Kalawati Devi his wife says . " And if there is no harvest we get nothing . "For 10 years Joshi worked as a snack seller in Delhi sending back money to help his family survive .He says that all changed after Singh and his organization Tarun Bharat Sangh showed up . The group came to teach the villagers something their forefathers once practiced : The building of traditional dams called Johads .The dams are made of earth and rock . They are fashioned to capture the rain so the water will trickle down and replenish the aquifer eventually giving rise to water in the wells and bringing dead rivers back to life .But the work takes a community effort . One family is not enough to get it done . Singh says his role is to teach and motivate the community ." There are more than 10 thousand water harvesting structures we have made in last 25 years . And all these structures came through the community effort . I just motivate and realize to the community and the community joined hands with us and they made it ! "It is easy to see the result when water becomes available again . Everything from water buffalo to majestic peacocks . Water snakes gather at the watering holes .Over the years Singh says his organization and the villagers of Rajasthan have revived seven rivers across the state helping more than a thousand villages .Now instead of traveling long distances carrying heavy vats of water , or migrating to the cities to make a living , the villagers can stay put and begin to enjoy their surroundings more .The availability of water brought the Joshi family back together again because the husband could finally make a living here ." I have planted many kinds of trees . For my livelihood I do farming . " He says " My family and I are leading very peaceful lives . " 	 0
Jerusalem Following an investigation , Israel apologized to Egypt this week over an August incident in which five Egyptian border guards were killed , the Israeli Ministry of Defense said .The apology , issued Tuesday , was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , who was captured by the Palestinian group Hamas more than five years ago . However , it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional Egyptian government , as relations between Israel and Egypt have become strained in recent months .On August 18 , militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack Israeli civilian targets . Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks , which Israel has said were the work of a jihadist group based in Gaza . Responding to the attacks , Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while in pursuit of the militants .The investigation into the incident was conducted by senior Israel Defense Forces officials and Egyptian army officials , the Ministry of Defense said . For security reasons , the ministry said , the results of the probe remain sealed .Israel issued a rare statement of regret three days after the incident , after Egypt suggested it was recalling its ambassador in protest .The overture , however , was deemed insufficient by many in Egypt and days later , angry protesters ransacked the Israeli Embassy in Cairo . The entire staff was hastily withdrawn after U . S . President Barack Obama personally intervened with the Egyptians to secure their safe passage , but the sequence of events dealt a blow to Israeli Egyptian relations .In the wake of the embassy incident , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would stick to its 1979 peace agreement with Egypt .In the Tuesday statement , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the August militant attack was " despicable " and " meant to murder as many Israeli citizens as possible and destroy the peaceful relations that are strategically important between Israel and Egypt , " the Tuesday statement said .But " based on the findings of the investigation , the defense minister decided to express his apology to Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire . "Netanyahu , meanwhile , spoke Thursday with the head of Egypt ' s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi and thanked him for the " central role " Egypt played in the agreement for Shalit ' s return , the prime minister ' s office said ." Your assistance warms the cockles of the heart of all Israeli citizens , " Netanyahu told Tantawi . 	 0
As rumors continue that Ken Jennings has lost his 75th Jeopardy ! competition , he has decided to reveal his winning strategy . . . and the reason his record breaking stance as the largest money winner in Jeopardy ! history has ended ." It ' s really simple , " Jennings told reporters during a special press conference at the Jeopardy ! studios . " A microchip inserted next to my ear last year for Mormon genealogy identification purposes somehow malfunctioned , and it opened a direct WiFi connection to the Google search engine . "Ken Jennings explained that due to this bizarre configuration of technology , physiology and computability , all he had to do was hear a question and Google did the rest . He explained that taking only microseconds the Google search engine results on Jeopardy ! answers were audibly transmitted back to him , securing his money making win . Not aware at first that this was the reason for his brainiac performance , Jennings related that he had been convinced he was hearing the voice of God ." I believed God was helping me win the 2 . 5 million , " he said . " But on that 75th show , the voice told me ' Page Not Found . ' That ' s when I began to suspect something was amiss . "However , it was basic technology that proved both Ken Jennings ' friend and his foe when Prudence Whitherstone , the contestant who finally ended Jennings ' championship streak , began receiving the Google results through her hearing aid ." If they had placed me on the opposite end of contestants row , I might have never gotten the Google boost , " said Whitherstone , " but I was standing next to Ken and the signal somehow crossed over to me . Sadly , it disappeared soon after . "Jeopardy ! officials stated that Jennings will not be required to return any of his winnings , and that Whitherstone may also keep the money she won while defeating him ." How can we punish Ken Jennings for this technological mishap ? " said Jeopardy ! host , Alex Trebek . " He didn ' t do it willfully , he thought God was helping him , but we will be requiring CAT scans of all future contestants to assure that this anomaly isn ' t repeated . "In a related story , Las Vegas wagering on Ken Jennings ' winning streak took a downturn when the rumor surfaced , and a plan for Salt Lake City , Utah , to erect a monument to Morman intellectualism has been postponed indefinitely . 	 1

She said she couldn ' t bear the thought of the defendant being sent to prison because of the children . 'According to Mr O ' Brien , Mrs Gosley ' s late husband had reassured her she would be cared for after his death .He said : ' He told me " Don ' t cry Tosh , you will be all right " and I was all right because he left me quite a lot of money , but it ' s vanished . The lot . 'During her trial , the granddaughter claimed in the witness box that her grandma had approved each and every transaction , including giving her about 65 , 000 in a single ' gift ' by selling shares .According to Gosley Shaw , Mrs Gosley also lent her money because she had financial problems following the break up of her marriage and lived beyond her means .Gosley Shaw said : ' She is a very , very kind and generous woman .

She was here almost daily .' She was so helpful . She would do anything for me , go to the shops , anything . I adored Katie .' She was always full of life and liked a good chat . We were good pals .' If I was down in the dumps she was the one who brought me up . She was very good .' What happened was a terrible shock . It ' s unbelievable how it happened .' If she ' d have wanted anything all she had to do was ask and she could have had it . 'During sentencing , Judge Rodney Jameson QC told Gosley Shaw : ' You stole from your grandmother who by the end of matters was in her late eighties .' She thought that you were the epitome of modern , glamorous living .' She was speaking highly of you . In many respects finding it difficult to reconcile with the person she had known until then to the person you had been over the past four years . 'Judge Jameson added : ' You did not need to do what you did . This was not in my judgement a case where necessary or significant pressure played any part in this offence .' In contrast , the theft left your grandmother virtually penniless , living on a state pension .' It is about as mean as an offence as is possible to imagine . 'Ruth Gosley ( wearing blue ) was left without heat and unable to buy clothes after granddaughter Katie Gosley Shaw ( wearing wedding dress ) stole her savings 	 0

All Blacks fly half Aaron Cruden has expressed his ' shame ' at being dropped from the New Zealand lineup after he missed the team ' s flight to Argentina on Sunday following a drunken night out .Cruden missed the assembly time for the departure and was dropped by coach Steve Hansen for the team ' s Rugby Championship tour matches against the Pumas and South Africa .He was also reprimanded by Hansen , who will likely pick Beauden Barrett to replace the 25 year old for Saturday ' s clash against Argentina in La Plata and the following week ' s match against the Springboks .New Zealand fly half Aaron Cruden is tackled by Australia full back Israel Folau' I am deeply embarrassed by this lack of judgement and have never been more disappointed in myself , ' Cruden said in a statement released by the New Zealand Rugby Union on Monday .' I carry the burden of shame and disappointment and I am deeply apologetic to my team , to my family , and also the New Zealand public .' I have no excuses . I accept full responsibility for my actions and the penalty of missing the next two games , and I will work with New Zealand Rugby to undertake any other disciplinary action to work through this situation . 'Though the team initially said Cruden had been left behind because of the late night excursion , Hansen said in Argentina that he had missed the flight .' We didn ' t have a curfew . He was out drinking and he didn ' t get there in time , ' Hansen earlier told New Zealand media in Argentina .' It ' s obviously disappointing and out of character for ( Aaron ) .

LOS ANGELES If you ask Dale Henderson , a local assassin who celebrated his eighth wedding anniversary last month , lone gunman John Kingsley has no idea how good he has it .Able to stay out as late as he wants holding innocent civilians hostage , and free to make weekend murder plans without first getting permission from his wife , the 29 year old bachelor is " as lucky as they come . "" What I ' d give to trade places with that guy , " Henderson said Monday after watching Kingsley shoot up a community college campus on the evening news . " Running around firing indiscriminately into a crowd of people now that ' s someone who doesn ' t have to wake up early to go furniture shopping tomorrow . "" Enjoy it while it lasts , buddy , " Henderson added . " Enjoy it while it lasts . "Henderson , 37 , who said he hasn ' t had a spare moment to himself atop an abandoned warehouse in months , openly admitted that he was jealous of Kingsley ' s lifestyle . Tired of always having to stop trailing a potential victim to pick up a gallon of milk , Henderson said he can only hope Kingsley doesn ' t take his freedom for granted ." John should appreciate how fortunate he is to be able to spend all night staring unblinkingly at his bedroom ' s ceiling fan , " Henderson said . " Don ' t get me wrong , I love Sheila . But sometimes a man just needs some time alone to plan the untimely death of a local judge . "After an afternoon spent wistfully leafing through old news clippings from his life as a carefree , single gunman , Henderson seemed to long for the days when he could walk up to any random attractive woman on the street , put a gun to her head , and pull the trigger without having to feel guilty .Henderson also said he wished he still had the freedom to cover the walls of his home with photos of supermodels , celebrity athletes , and other future targets rather than the dainty flower patterns his wife selected ." Often when I ' m helping Sheila clean out the attic , I wonder what that lucky lone gunman is up to with all his spare time , " Henderson said . " Probably climbing to the top of a clock tower or threatening to pump some worthless bastard full of lead if he calls the police . "Added Henderson , " God , I know I would be . "Kingsley ' s recent slaughter at an area McDonald ' s has also been difficult for the married gunman to endure , since his wife would " probably have his head " if he ever set foot inside a fast food restaurant . And , with countless new responsibilities , Henderson claimed that , unlike Kingsley , the closest he ever gets to terrorizing a post office nowadays is going out to mail Christmas cards ." It must be nice not to have to answer to anyone , or explain where you ' ve been all day , " Henderson said . " And I can ' t imagine John has ever totally missed the visiting presidential motorcade because someone forgot to put gas in the car . "Though Henderson remains jealous that , as a young wanted man , Kingsley gets to sleep in a different safe house every night , he admitted that matrimony still has its upsides ." It ' s nice to know there ' s always someone waiting there for you , regardless of how bad your day has been , " Henderson said . " Plus , the alibi thing doesn ' t hurt . " 	 1
boston, massachusetts a 22 year old medical student suspected of killing a woman he may have met through a craigslist online ad was arraigned tuesday and will be held without bail. medical student philip markoff, 22, appears in court tuesday in boston, massachusetts. philip markoff, a second year student at boston university's school of medicine, listened intently but did not speak during the hearing in boston municipal court. dressed in a blue striped shirt and slacks, markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons. his attorney, john salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that markoff is " not guilty of the charges. he has his family's support. i have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what i heard in the courtroom. all i have at the moment are words no proof of anything. " a woman identifying herself as markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e mail sent to abc news. megan mcallister said markoff " is the wrong man " and " was set up. " " unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public, " mcallister wrote. " all i have to say to you is philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly! " she accused boston police of " trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the tv stations. what else is new?? " suffolk county district attorney daniel conley told reporters, " this was a brutal, vicious crime savage. and it shows that philip markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them. " a procedural not guilty plea was entered on markoff's behalf, conley said. a boston university spokeswoman said the school suspended markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on monday. markoff is charged with killing 26 year old julissa brisman of new york on april 14 at boston's copley marriott hotel. evidence from the scene suggests that brisman " put up a fight, " prosecutor jennifer hickman said during the hearing tuesday. police said brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. she sustained blunt head trauma, hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. one of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said. markoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a westin hotel. in that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, hickman said. she was robbed of 800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, hickman said in court tuesday. police said earlier the westin victim was 29. she was not identified. authorities believe the motive in brisman's death was robbery, conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. in executing a search warrant at markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. watch police say assailant has perused craigslist adssurveillance videos from the hotel where brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man. police traced the internet communications with brisman to an e mail account opened the day before her death, conley said. using internet provider information, they found the computer was at markoff's residence in quincy, massachusetts, he said. authorities put the home under surveillance, conley said, and " the case just begins to build from there. " " this poor woman, julissa brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect, " conley said. there may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on craigslist. " if you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward, " he said. markoff is " bearing up, " according to attorney salsberg. " it's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him.... he's pleaded not guilty. he is not guilty, " said salsberg. mcallister, in her e mail to abc, wrote, " philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it. we expect to marry in august and share a wonderful, meaningful life together.

Facing certain defeat due to Barack Obama ' s insurmountable lead and his refusal to look for sex in public bathrooms , Senator Hillary Clinton resigned from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night .She then immediately accepted the Libertarian Party nomination , which was offered to her outright in a shocking and unprecedented move by a political party long believed by casual observers to identify more closely with Republicans than with Democrats .Former Libertarian Party frontrunner and Johnny come lately Bob Barr could not be satisfactorily sedated for comment ." I offer the Libertarian Party a revitalized vision , " Clinton told a small but enthusiastic crowd of party insiders . " Henceforth , let our motto be , ' What about the children ? ' "" She ' s our man , " said Libertarian Party spokesman Will Cave . " She ' s privatizing her health care model . Everyone will have to pay fifty cents to see a doctor or have brain surgery ." The Bill of Rights is important to her . She promises to build bathroom facilities and daycare centers in free speech zones so people can exercise their right to petition for redress of grievances in ineffective comfort ." She will order Homeland Security to eliminate some domestic spying programs that can be turned over to local police or voluntarily managed by busybody sheep with cell phone cameras ." She has even hinted at entertaining the notion of allowing herself to possibly consider the idea of contemplating giving some thought to mulling over sharing war powers with Congress and banning some forms of torture if she feels like it later and we don ' t nag her too much about it ." She also will not allow her vice president to run roughshod over the rest of the world . That ' s her job , and he ' ll just be her paid lackey , " Cave concluded .Because Clinton ' s nomination is a third party affair , the corporate approved neoconservative mouthpieces who monopolize talk radio are mostly united in their feigned ignorance of the situation ." Hillary who ? " said Rush Limbaugh . " Is she related to Bubba ? "" Never heard of her , " asserted Sean Hannity , continuing his denials even when confronted with a montage of sound bites of him bashing Clinton repeatedly . " I don ' t care what I said . She doesn ' t exist . I made her up . Those tapes are doctored . That isn ' t me talking . Someone get these liberal yahoos out of here ! "" I ' ve never heard of any Libertarian Party , " rasped Bill O ' Reilly . " Oh , wait , aren ' t they those Constitution waving , dope smoking , illegal immigrant harboring tax cheats who eat their children and want the terrorists to win ? This is no time for principles . We are at war . They should all be waterboarded and shot for treason . "Only Neal Boortz , a self proclaimed Libertarian , has admitted to any knowledge of the situation .In a scathing attack on his party ' s leadership , he blurted , " I can ' t believe those double crossing expletive deleted have thrown in with that Jezebel ! You can ' t trust anybody to sell out to the right people anymore ! " 	 1
the end of the world conjures up several images, the first would be the dave matthews band and that song from the " everyday " album " when the world ends ". it is quite a sexy song, you know " when the world ends, just get your things, you're coming with me. when the world ends... " bit scarey too, but what the hoo haa? woman is alive! it wasn't released because of the september 11th crap, instead they released " the space between ", well that is to say they release " the space between " here in the uk. who knows about america? going back to last year. it was november 12th, a tuesday, and i was being interviewed for a job. the job was crap and they offered me a piddling little 12 grand a year, so i told them to shove it inside their rectums and made reference to places where the sun doesn't shine. they, in turn, advised me to take a run and jump in the nearest lake. what do they know? the nearest lake i know of is lake windermere. i would be hard pressed to find a lake in london, they should have referred to the thames instead. upon leaving the interview i walk down tottenham court road, regaining my non pre menstrual composure and considering the thames option, i look at the numerous shops i pass by and window shop. god! some of these shops cater to women who are no bigger than my index finger. hate them! so, i soon come to the virgin megastore. it's a record shop. there is this sign right it says dave matthews here today! " i know them " i think to myself, so in i goes and i see albums. albums? yes! albums. i am 31 and thought albums were dead, replaced now by cds. god! the expense of replacing one's record collection springs to mind as i muse through. so, i look at these vinyl disks and recall buying such classics as malcolm maclaren's buffalo girls and other classics like adam and the ants, duran duran, culture club and more. i pick up an album and it is by some snoop droop poopy scoopy fella and there is another one by icey tea with lemon or something. kids today? what crap they listen to, eh? ok so i wait around and pick up " everyday ", that's the album by the dave matthews band and figure i will have it. well, all the shop assistants are wearing these stupid green t shirts with " i am dave matthews " plastered all over them. this dave matthews bloke must be alright with all of these people crowded around, despite the t shirts, so i bought the cd wondering if it was on vinyl. standing around and my back is killing me all i hear are americans. god! they get everywhere don't they? their chewy accents and everything. this girl with long, curly blonde hair and a figure the size of my index finger, starts moaning because " dave was meant to be out at 1 o'clock and it's now 1. 30. " " gawd! " she says, a force 9 gale coming from her mouth as she spoke, totally ruining my hairpiece. " gawd! aye only got me an hour lunch breek! " and she starts banging on about 4 albums and how pathetic it was that she couldn't go downstairs considering she was american. i think " downstairs? we can go downstairs? buggery buggers! " so i stand there with my back murdering me and this american girl breathing wrigley's spearmint gum up me nostrils. hanging around i start to recall john bon jovi. it was a fair few years back when i was walking down marble arch and couldn't pass by this building somewhere, don't recall where, because there were about 75 photographs and 85 camera crews all jostling for space to catch something. i stand around a wee bit and am told, by this wonderfully handsome chap ( yes i remember that, nudge, nudge, wink, wink ) that bon jovi will be playing. being several years younger and totally starstruck i waited. it was a mere 3 minutes before john bon jovi came out, with his guitar and started playing. if that is his own hair i am a chimpanzee. he looked straight at me, pointed and winked. i turned around and there is no one behind me. " what a tw t! " i thought, as he played " living on a prayer ". every media person shouting, screaming and clicking away. some media types shouted obscenities to get a reaction, but most went along with the ride and that night the whole episode hit uk tv and was promoted as an " on spec performance ". my ars 	 1
The baby Kate and William are expecting was not conceived as babies usually are .No , Kate had a visit from an angel one night and the result is a baby ." She was all in white a white robe and above her head was a very luminous halo . I therefore immediately recognized the lady as an angel . It just so happens that on the cover of the book Will and I have , but of which , I must admit , we still have not colored all the pictures , there is a painting of an angel . I therefore instantly knew that I ' m being visited by an angel , " Kate has told a friend .As she told William the morning after : " An angel came to speak to me at around two o ' clock . She swept a wand over my body and told me , ' Kate , you are to bear a boy child who will be King of England , Wales , some South Sea islands , and of Scotland , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , but only until those four countries have become republics ' . "" Gosh , " William had replied . " An Immaculate Conception ! This will give the Windsor dynasty a boost . Can ' t wait to hear what Gran will say about it . "As we have learned the Queen did not doubt Kate ' s story for a moment because she knew that Kate ' s baby could not have been conceived in the normal way . She knew that William had taken a vow of celibacy because a recent scientific report said that abstaining from sex made one intelligent . ( Unlike previous monarchs , he wants to be one with brains . )Her Majesty also knew that Kate would not have cheated on William because he had put her in a chastity belt to make sure she did not stray .Because of his celibacy vow , William has been sleeping every night bandaged up from head to toe to ensure that any romantic ardor would instantly be repressed . The Windsors , having decided that they would follow the Biblical example of an Immaculate Conception down to a T , are now preparing one of the stables of Queen Elisabeth ' s horses for the birth .Prime Minister David Cameron and two government ministers will be the Three Wise Men . 	 1
Washington DC Faced by increased popular pressure against its moves to control and censor the Internet , Congress has decided to sell the World Wide Web to the highest bidder ." The Internet is very powerful in its ability to encourage people to think , interact and innovate , " Rep . Peter King ( R New York ) said . " That makes it very dangerous to a government that ' s not smart enough to balance its own checkbook ." So we say the heck with it . Let ' s unload the darn thing , and it can be somebody else ' s problem . "Passed by unanimous votes in both the Senate and the House , the World Wide White Wash Act stipulates that the Internet be sold to an entity outside the United States and that American citizens be banned from using it ." We ' ve already gotten bids from China , Russia and Iran , " said Sen . Patrick Leahy ( D Vermont ) . " These are countries with regimes that know how to keep things under control . If the money is right , I can see any one of them as the proud proprietor of the Internet . "Significant American enterprises such as Google , Yahoo ! and Facebook could conceivably be destroyed once the Internet is sold ." I don ' t pretend to understand what these companies do , " said Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith ( R Texas ) . " But I know that America was a better place before they existed . "Analysts speculated that the trillions of dollars sale of the Internet would generate could reduce the nation ' s deficit . But the Congressional Budget Office pointed out that once the Senators and Representatives take their cut , there will be nothing left but " chump change . "In signing the WWWW Act into law , President Barack Obama praised Congress for " finally getting together on something , " noting that the legislation would be the high water mark of his presidency ." You wanted hope and change , Mr and Mrs American voter ? " Obama said . " Well , here ' s your change . I hope you like it . " 	 1

Them was just plain black ! " Noddy Holder fumed . " What a blinkin ' let down ! Talk about a wasted opportunity . . .

"Alice Cooper ' s snake , Yvonne merely flicked her tongue out a bit .Mick ' Simply Red ' Hucknall dismissed the choice of hosiery as " irrelevant , " saying that it was more important that the balding Prince elected to wear a red jacket , rather than one in the blue of Manchester City or Chelsea .Former Sex Pistol , John ' Johnny Rotten ' Lydon said he wasn ' t too bothered by the Prince ' s conservative hosiery choice , saying that he thought the couple looked " enchanting " and adding that he hoped they spread real English butter on the crumpets at the reception .A spokesperson for Babyshambles front man , Pete Doherty , said he had no idea if Pete would be watching or not , adding that he was probably off with George Michael somewhere getting " nutted .

the institution of marriage is unique. it is the one institution that binds women and men together to form a family, and this serves broad societal purposes. in california, a u. s. district court judge last week overturned proposition 8, the california marriage protection act. it was passed in november 2008 by california voters to recognize " only marriage between a man and a woman. " the majority of californians, including two thirds of the state's black voters, have just had their core civil right the right to vote stripped from them by an openly gay federal judge who has misread history and the constitution to impose his views on the state's people. the implicit comparison judge vaughn walker made between racism and opposition to same sex marriage is particularly offensive to me and to all who remember the reality of jim crow. it is not bigotry, it is biology that discriminates between same sex couples and opposite sex couples. a marriage requires a husband and a wife, because these unions are necessary to make new life and connect children to their mother and father. judge walker's decision will not stand the test of time and history. congress and the supreme court must act to protect all americans'right to vote for marriage. advocates of making same sex marriage a legally recognized right claim that this will have no impact on traditional marriage that it can peacefully coexist alongside traditional marriage. on the contrary, it will have profound impacts. it will create a conflict for people of faith ( and nonreligious people as well ) who fervently believe in traditional man woman marriage and the law. the bible is so clear in its support of heterosexual marriage there is little need for us to go through an exhaustive definition of biblical marriage versus the types of unions allowed by law today. the scriptures say in genesis 2 : 24 that a man is to leave his family and cleave to his wife. this concept is repeated in matthew 19 : 5 and mark 10 : 7. all the scriptures in the bible concerning marriage presuppose heterosexual marriage. we can teach our kids that there are important spiritual and societal reasons to believe in traditional marriage and oppose same sex marriage. but if same sex marriage becomes legally recognized across the country, our kids will be told that gay marriage is a civil rights issue and that those who oppose it are akin to the racists of history who opposed interracial marriage and supported slavery. we can teach our children at home that marriage is between a man and a woman, but our children's public schools will teach them that marriage includes same sex couples. both would be " equal marriages " under the law. what might this look like? in massachusetts, where a ruling legalized same sex marriage in 2004, kids in public schools are reading books depicting same sex families. at a california charter school in 2008, kindergartners'parents objected when a school newsletter alerted them to " national coming out day " a parent told a local abc tv affiliate that a teacher at the school screened a film to kindergartners the previous year showing gay families. these kinds of ill advised social experiments may produce a host of unexpected consequences. if gay marriage is allowed, the nation will soon begin to experience an increased degradation of the nuclear family resulting in fewer kids being raised by both a mom and a dad. beyond that, those of us who believe in traditional marriage and are in a regulated profession such as counselor, physician, attorney or accountant and act in concert with our beliefs, may be vulnerable to losing our professional license and our livelihood. we can be a religious charity faithfully fulfilling our mission by serving our community, such as by providing adoption and other services, but if we refuse to provide those services to a same sex couple, we have the choice of abandoning our beliefs or ending our mission. in 2003, adoption. com was sued by two california homosexual men, who claimed illegal discrimination because the agency refused to serve homosexual couples. the agency lost the lawsuit and no longer serves adoptive parents in california. an even more substantive danger lies in the consequences of gay marriage on the next generation. redefining marriage redefines family. changing the concept of family will change both the definition and the pattern of parenting. what will the landscape of america look like if same sex marriage is legalized across our nation? social scientists report what most americans have always known : both boys and girls are deeply affected in biological and psychological ways by the presence of their fathers. if the american family loses the presence of the birth dad in the home, there will be huge consequences to the growth and stability of the next generation of children in that family. for example, repeatedly, scholarly studies focused on adolescence show that early onset of puberty in girls is associated with negative psychological, social, and health problems including depression, alcohol consumption, and higher teenage pregnancy. an eight year study of girls and their families showed that a father's presence in the home, with appropriate involvement in his children ' 	 0
Berlin When the old eastern bloc finally crumbled in upon it ' s own decaying Stalinist foundations it wasn ' t only hordes of badly dressed east Germans that flocked into the gaudy neon strasses of west Berlin following closely behind the mulleted flood was the immense secret archives of the GDR .It ' s a well known fact in the west that the east German security apparatus was a ruthlessly efficient monitor of everyday life and that even the most trivial phone call was recorded and classified for use against anyone with a dissenting view or a new pair of Levis . In fact : the Stasi operated in pretty much the same way as the American intelligence agencies operate today .But a fact that is less well known to the ordinary Hans on the strasse is that after the end of world war two , when the Allied powers split their old enemy into easily digestible slices , the vast secret records of the defeated Gestapo fell silently into the hands of their Communist conquerors and there they laid quietly undisturbed for the next sixty two years gathering dust in the huge grey staatsarchiv building just off the busy Potsdammer Strasse .It is only recently that historians have managed to trawl through the countless documents and recordings and what has come to light recently sheds new light on the dark years of Germany ' s National Socialist past .One of the most astounding stories to be liberated from the dank cellars of the Staatsarchiv , concerns the amazing story of operation " Girly boy " a secret Nazi plan intended to be the dastardly overture to the invasion of Britain .The plan was conceived some time in early 1939 by the now infamous Treblinka camp doctor , Dr Ernst Shitclitz , the plan called for the creation of squads of devastatingly attractive transexuals to be trained in the cunning art of shemale seduction and then dropped by parachute along the heavily defended coast of southern England .The stated aim of operation " Girly boy " was to foster sexual confusion and spread moral decadence amongst British forces protecting the nations soft southern underbelly .Hitler personally approved the Shitclitz plan and asked to kept fully informed of all future developments concerning the operation .The cunning scheme , however , was never to come to full fruition as the Battle of Britain ended Hitler ' s plan for a full scale invasion of the British mainland .We can only now look back on Dr Shitclitz ' s devilish scheme with a sense of morbid curiosity and relieved gratitude that the horrific plan never materialized and vaguely wonder what other long forgotten plans lay quietly brooding within the old Staatsarchiv . 	 1
HOLLYWOOD HILLS Demi Lovato was to have appeared at a concert at this year ' s Wisconsin Cheese State Fair in May but she has reportedly cancelled it .Lovato , who last year spent three months at The Henry and Betty Ford Rehab Clinic spoke with iGossip ' s Taffeta Kixx and she said that after the way she heard that Governor Scott Walker had treated the states union workers there is just no way that she could set foot in a state whose leader has such low regard for teachers , police , firemen , and professional wrestlers .Lovato said that she received a text message from Governor Walker himself asking her to please reconsider because he had already printed up 2 , 000 concert posters which showed her looking so pretty dressed in her designer clothes which she no doubt purchased from the most expensive clothing store on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive .Demi said she texted him back asking if he was kidding her . She then reminded him that 90 percent of her family including her cousin Ringling Brothers Barnum Bailey circus clown Escobar " El Habanero " Lovato all are or have been members of various unions .Governor Scotty , as his wife calls him , declared in desperation that he would buy ( with the states money of course ) 10 , 000 of her latest CDs that he would personally distribute to the children of the thousands of laid off union workers .He also told her that he would send her 400 coupons for free nacho cheese dip packets . Plus he would give her season tickets on the 50 yard line to the upcoming 2011 2012 season of the Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers .Lovato responded by texting him STCATTUYA !EDITOR ' S NOTE : I used my handy Text Messaging Dictionary which I received from my brother this past Christmas and I can say that the letters Demi texted stand for ' Stick The Coupons And The Tickets Up Your A s . 	 1
The English Wine industry is mourning the loss of Nigel Pargetter who died on Sunday night after falling from the roof of Lower Loxley Hall in the village of Ambridge , Borsetshire .Nigel was the ' go to ' man in the village on all matters relating to fine wine . A keen enthusiast of Bordeaux and Burgundy , Nigel also produced wine from his own vines at Lower Loxley . Mr Pargetter had long been admired for his indefatigable optimism and was regarded as one of the key men in English regional wine .Although his death was initially presumed to be an accident , evidence now suggests that foul play may have been involved . The internet is awash with accusations that Vannessa Whitburn ( a senior BBC radio editor ) murdered Mr Pargetter in a callous act of ratings chasing vandalism .No one has seen or heard from Whitburn since a bizarre interview with the Today program on the morning after Nigel ' s fall . In the interview Whitburn confirmed that Mr Pargetter was indeed dead this before either the police or Nigel ' s family had provided any official announcement .Experts have been quick to point out that Whitburn ' s interview displayed all the characteristics of a sociopathic killer desire for attention , superiority gained by goading of the public , an inability to admit any wrongdoing .Whatever the truth of the matter , our thoughts go out to Nigel ' s wife Elizabeth , their two children and to David Archer who was on the roof with Nigel at the time of his fall .Nigel ' s death is a symbolic loss to the world of English wine and a personal loss felt by so many who were glad to have known him . He was indeed " a thoroughly nice bloke " . 	 1
Blue Tick , Ohio An 89 year old Ohio woman faces charges of petit theft and grievous bodily harm after being arrested for keeping neighbourhood children ' s balls .Edna Gonads was taken into custody by Blue Tick sheriff ' s deputy , Barney Fife , over the weekend . According to Deputy Fife , Mrs Gonads had an ongoing dispute with several neighbourhood boys who were constantly playing football near her house ." It appears it was just some kids having fun , but Mrs Gonads got a little testy and took matters into her own hands , " reported Fife , as he swaggered in front of assembled reporters outside the Blue Tick jail .Fife added , with considerable self importance , " Apparently the boys ' football kept getting kicked or thrown into the alleged perpetrator ' s front lawn , breaking her begonias . When they asked for it back , Mrs Gonads lured them onto her property with promises of fresh baked apple pie and lemonade , " stated Fife , nervously fidgeting with his bullet ." When the three boys , aged eleven , eleven and a half , and twelve , were pretty high on the lemonade , " Mrs Gonads took out her apple paring knife and relieved each of them of their balls . "Deputy Fife added , " The crime scene wasn ' t a pretty site . I haven ' t seen anything like it since the Darling boys got ahold of Ernest T . Bass for fiddling with Charlene and stuck him like a pig . It was awful , just awful . "Blue Tick officials are withholding the names of the alleged victims because of their ages . However , Deputy Fife assured reporters that Opie Taylor was not one of boys castrated by Mrs Gonads ." Andy made me check the balls straight away , and none of them was Opie ' s , " assured a high pitched and high strung Fife . " Just to make sure , I called home and had Aunt Bea do a strip search on Opie , and she reported they were both hanging right where she had left them . "In her self defence , Mrs Gonads issued a statement through her lawyer . In the statement , a feisty Mrs Gonads alleges that the three boys deserved their punishment ." It ' s my property . I warned them what would happen if they didn ' t stay out of my flower beds . They messed with my begonia bulbs so I messed with theirs . Plain and simple . "Many of Blue Tick ' s rural population were shocked by the news of the castration of three of the town ' s boys by the kindly widower . Helen Crump , a neighbour , told reporters that she knew Mrs Gonads well and couldn ' t believe the allegations ." She is a sweet old lady who baked apple pies , made lemonade and sat on her veranda listening to classical music all the time . I think her favourite was the Farinelli : Il Castrato soundtrack , " added Ms Crump , who happens to be the local Blue Tick music teacher .After a pause , and with a gleam in her eye , Ms Crump exclaimed , " All might not be lost ! Six little pre pubescent testicles would be a small price to pay if I am able to form a trio out of these three boys in time for the Mount Pilot auditions for the next X Factor ! I just hope Louie Walsh will be coaching the groups again next year . " 	 1
Patui Tui Twonga , South Pacific Following some intensive investigative work , we caught up with Godzilla on a remote island where the resurgent mutant lizard was keeping a low profile , after having been deported from the big island of Hawaii for causing a major sanitation crisis in the Kilauea lava lake . Extensive reports about the actual incident have been sparse and have tended to be rumor laden , but an unnamed source from the Hawaiian State Office of Mellow Sustainability told us that Godzilla had evacuated what remained of a couple of Japanese nuclear reactors in said location .Godzilla was basking in the sun on a western beach of Patui Tui Twonga , and he seemed to be momentarily content while sucking on an atomic warhead . We opened with a question about his recent return to the cinematic screen and then moved on to ask the intrepid reptile about a medley of topics . His unedited responses follow .Current Movie : " Yeah , it was cool being back in there , doing my thing in a ' vortex of destruction ' . ' Leastwise that ' s the way my director , Tony Ripcord , put it . But , hey , it ' s a gig pays the bills , man . ' Twas something of a drag being stuck in that synthetic digital environment , though . . . like being jailed in virtual reality , but I guess it was good for my motivation , y ' know ramped me up for eating them nuclear silos and knocking the crap outta them Tokyo buildings .

Show me real proof : Djokovic rubbishes ' absurd ' match fixing allegationATP ? Australian Open 2016 ? Match Fixing ? Novak Djokovic ? SportsTracker ? Tennis ? TheySaidIt ?Melbourne , Australia : ? ? World number one Novak Djokovic has called for those making corruption allegations to provide proof after blasting as " absurd " an Italian newspaper which suggested he could have thrown a match ." It ' s not true , " the 28 year old Serb told a tense press conference at the Australian Open when asked about the suggestion by Tuttosport newspaper about his 2007 defeat by Frenchman Fabrice Santoro at the Paris Masters .The reigning champion , who eased into the third round with a 6 1 , 6 2 , 7 6 ( 7 3 ) win over French teenager Quentin Halys in Melbourne on Wednesday , described the current speculation about tennis as " absurd " .He said it would remain speculation until there is " real proof and evidence " .Novak Djokovic has rubbished allegations of throwing a game . AFPTennis authorities have also strongly denied suggestions that evidence of corruption has been deliberately suppressed .Tuttosport suggested that Djokovic could have deliberately lost to Santoro at the Paris Masters in 2007 . Djokovic played then just after having had his wisdom teeth taken out ." What it is to say ? I ' ve lost that match . I don ' t know if you ' re trying to create a story about that match or for that matter any of the matches of the top players losing in the early rounds , I think it ' s just absurd , " said Djokovic ." Anybody can create a story about any match . That ' s my point . There hasn ' t been too many matches where top players lost in ( the ) last decade or so in ( the ) early rounds ." You can pick any match that you like that the top player lost and just create a story out of it ." I think it ' s not supported by any kind of proof , any evidence , any facts . It ' s just speculation . So I don ' t think there is a story about it . "Djokovic ' s name was mentioned in an Italian prosecution investigation into illegal betting on football and tennis . Two Italian players were suspected of accepting bribes .But the inquiry was officially closed in December .The BBC and BuzzFeed News claimed on the eve of the Australian Open that 16 top players had repeatedly been suspected of involvement in fixed matches but never faced action .Djokovic said earlier this week that he had been indirectly offered 200 , 000 to throw a first round match in St Petersburg in 2007 just before the Paris Masters . He said it was rejected and he did not go to the Russian tournament .Djokovic said on Monday that tennis corruption was " a crime in sport " but he added at the latest press conference that much of the talk is speculation ." My response is that there ' s always going to be , especially these days when there is a lot of speculations , this is now the main story in tennis , in ( the ) sports world , there ' s going to be a lot of allegations , " he said ." I have nothing more to say . I said everything I needed to say two days ago . You know , until somebody comes out with the real proof and evidence , it ' s only a speculation for me . "A host of former players have backed Djokovic and his fellow stars who have called for any evidence of alleged wrongdoing to be made public ." We need facts , not suppositions , " tweeted Martina Navratilova , a winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles . 	 0
There are only two multiple winners on the PGA Tour this season one of them is in top form ahead of the U . S . Open , and the other is Tiger Woods .Matt Kuchar moved up to second place in the FedEx Cup standings with victory at Jack Nicklaus ' Memorial Tournament on Sunday , having finished runner up last weekend at the Crowne Plaza Invitational .It is the first time the American has won more than once in one season , having also claimed the World Golf Championships Match Play title in February .His four under par 68 in the final round was crowned by a 21 foot birdie at the last hole which left him two shots clear of fast finishing Kevin Chappell , who is still waiting for his breakthrough win .The biggest names in the field world No . 1 Woods and second ranked Rory McIlroy were respectively nine and 13 shots off the pace after both carded par 72 .For defending champion Woods , Sunday ' s effort was a relative relief after Saturday ' s nightmare 79 his equal second worst score as a professional but he triple bogeyed the par three 12th hole that he had doubled in the third round . He also had a triple on Saturday .The American has won this event five times , but is struggling to regain the form that has already brought him four victories this season ahead of the second scheduled major at Merion in Pennsylvania starting June 13 ." You want everything clicking on all cylinders , especially at the U . S . Open , because everything is tested in the U . S . Open , " he said .Woods is still four short of Nicklaus ' record 18 major titles , and has not won one since the 2008 U . S . Open . He was eight over the card at Muirfield Village ." It wasn ' t that bad today , " Woods said . " It was just one hole that cost me obviously a few shots . It happens , it happens to us all . "McIlroy is also struggling for form ahead of the tournament that provided his first major win in 2011 ." I hit the ball much better today . I actually putted a little better , too . A little bit of work next week yeah , it ' s not that far away , " the Northern Irishman said after finishing in a tie for 57th ." It ' s just a little bit of an adjustment and something I can work on and something it was good to figure out this week , so I can work on it next week . "Kuchar , who has yet to win a major , was delighted after taking home the 1 . 16 million first prize in front of his wife and two children ." It ' s such an amazing feeling , this stuff never gets old , " the 34 year old Ryder Cup player said after his sixth PGA Tour victory . " To win this and have Jack Nicklaus congratulate me is a real treat . " 	 0
Today , Dr Collier , a 76 year old retired physicist from Ohio State University discovered an unlimited power source following the research done by Dr Edward Mullove a friend and colleague previously from MIT . Dr Collier said , " This was a continuation of my research on magnetism with Dr Mallove into magnetically containing a controlled fusion reaction . " He explained further " My experiment concentrated on the high temperature plasma problems but it turns out Dr Mullove was right . " Unwilling to elaborate , turned to the device for a demonstration .A Fusion Torch is a concept for the application of ultra high temperature plasmas found in fusion reactors . Dr Collier discovered how to contain this reaction in a very small space at very low temperatures using a magnetic field . He said he finally discovered a way to control the reaction in such a way so that he could " Turn the thing off without blowing up my house ! "He said his most difficult problem was having enough energy to start and stop the device . His neighbors often complained of power outages in the area and strange vibrations shaking the ground in the neighborhood . However , once started , it could power it ' s own " containment field " with almost no loss of the overall power output . The device literally makes no noise beyond a slight hum on start up . He said the loss of maintaining the magnetic field is less than . 000000000000000386 .This reporter was stunned at the results of a device the size of a trash can , powering Dr Colliers entire house for a week on the energy from a single banana peal .The ramifications of the device on the open market are mind boggling . " No more grid based energy systems for one good example ! " Dr Collier exclaimed . He has hired three private security firms for protection of the device and hopes to introduce it on the open market this year . He promises that " gas prices with drop to . 22 per gallon within a year of this device reaching the market . " He said with a grin on his face .Dr Collier was giggling when he said " I don ' t know about you , but the idea of never having to get gas for my car , or buy electricity from grid based systems sure appeals to me , but I doubt the Petroleum Companies aren ' t going to like it much ! "The world is changing and the future looks pretty good thanks to retired Physicist Arthur C . Collier . 	 1

united nations russia and china vetoed a u. n. security council resolution friday that would have imposed sanctions on zimbabwe's longtime president, robert mugabe, and 11 senior members of his government. zimbabwe president robert mugabe meets this week with arthur mutambara, an opposition leader. according to a draft of the resolution, the measure would have instituted a travel ban on mugabe and others in his government, frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime. the measure received nine votes the minimum for it to pass. however, two of the five negative votes were from russia and china, who as permanent members of the security council have veto power. one security council member abstained. the resolution was pushed by the united states after mugabe ignored the security council's appeal to postpone the june 27 presidential runoff election. the vote initially was intended to be a runoff between mugabe and opposition candidate morgan tsvangirai. but tsvangirai withdrew days before, saying mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against his supporters. with their votes, ambassadors for china and russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the security council. representatives from mugabe's party, the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ( zanu pf ), have been meeting in pretoria, south africa, with the opposition movement for democratic change this week. tsvangirai said wednesday the talks, which are being mediated by south african president thabo mbeki, are focusing on " how to move forward. " chinese ambassador wang guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in south africa on the zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions. wang said the adoption of the resolution would " unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation. " " many countries, including china, repeatedly called upon the security council to respect the position of the african countries on this question and give more time, " wang said. " china has always maintained the best approach to solve a problem is negotiation and dialogue, " wang said. " to use or threaten to use sanctions lightly is not conducive to solving the problem. " wang's comments echoed those of russian ambassador vitaly churkin, who said the security council would have overstepped its responsibilities had it approved the resolution. " recently, in the positions of a number of council member states, we have seen an ever more obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security, " churkin said. " we believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous, leading to a realignment of the entire u. n. system. " churkin also noted that, had the resolution been approved, council members would have ignored appeals from the african union to let the south african talks take place. he also accused the council of missing an opportunity to coordinate a response that would have " promoted the success of the political dialogue " in zimbabwe. speaking before the vote, zimbabwean ambassador boniface chidyausiku said his nation has been a victim of " incessant meddling " from the international community. chidyausiku blamed sanctions already imposed on zimbabwe for its underperforming economy and the suffering of its people. south african ambassador dumisani kumalo also urged the security council to give the south african talks a chance to bring about a resolution. u. s. ambassador zalmay khalilzad said the united states was disappointed at the veto. " china and russia have stood with mugabe against the people of zimbabwe... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground, " he said. " the u turn on the russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing, " he said, noting that a few days ago, the russian federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the group of eight meeting in japan expressing " grave concern " about the situation in zimbabwe. " the russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a g 8 partner, " khalilzad said. the draft resolution expressed " deep concern at the gross irregularities " during the presidential election, saying violence and intimidation before the runoff prevented " free and fair elections, " creating " an environment that did not permit international election observers to operate freely before the june 27 vote. " the united kingdom, which has been highly critical of mugabe, was a chief supporter of the united states push for sanctions. france also supported the resolution. " the security council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern africa, " british ambassador john sawers said after the vote. watch the british ambassador to the u. n. speaks about the failed resolutions 	 0
Put a face to the word " evil , " and it will probably have a toothbrush mustache and a comb over . Or , in this post 9 11 era , a white turban above an unkempt beard , the pairing barely visible through the narrow aperture of a spider hole . Even if you conjure a mental image of neither Adolf nor Osama , your personal personification of malevolence likely has one trait in common with these notorious bad boys : gender . And this among other affronts to womankind has Bridget Jelinek riled .Jelinek gets riled with some frequency . Over her twenty year tenure as president of Washington based American Women for Equality ( AWE ) , she has raised her manicured fist against many an injustice : the price mismatch between men ' s and women ' s haircuts , the scarcity of ladies rooms in university engineering buildings , the disrespect for women ' s maternal role evident in the widespread use of such phrases as " the mother of all bombs . " Jelinek and AWE made news last spring when the group ' s protest of this last indignity involved lobbing Molotov cocktails at White House police .What set Bridget Jelinek off this time , though , was Monday ' s release of an updated list of the FBI ' s Ten Most Wanted . Jelinek ' s beef with the collection of digitally sharpened mug shots now gracing post office bulletin boards nationwide ? There are no female fugitives included ." The absence left me almost speechless , " Jelinek told the Post . " I ' m floored by the fact that law enforcement fails to recognize women ' s very real capacity for evil . Homeland Security is just such an old boys ' club that they don ' t even realize their bias toward the masculine , power based , violent brand of wickedness . Women can be just as villainous . We just go about it in subtler , more underhanded ways . "Between its first issue on March 14 , 1950 and November 1 , 2009 a total of 494 menaces to society have appeared on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list , and only eight of them have been women .Despite Jelinek ' s keenness to cite this statistic in support of her theory , women ' s studies scholar Janice Gowing thinks there ' s more at work here than a male dominated government agency failing to recognize peculiarly feminine varieties of evil . She notes that though physically and mentally capable of orchestrating egregious misdeeds genocide , torture , enslavement members of the so called " fairer sex " have historically had fewer opportunities than their male counterparts to thus achieve infamy ." Search ' most evil people , ' " Gowing says , " and the lists you turn up will be exclusively male . " Sitting in her snug office surrounded by Mother Figure statuettes , the professor rattles off a familiar catalog of malefactors . " Hitler . Stalin . Vlad the Impaler . Genghis Khan . Saddam Hussein or George W . , maybe . " Even now , she says , few women hold enough sway to effect evil on the scale necessary to keep such murderous company ." Of course that could change , " Gowing concedes , gesturing toward a newly arrived copy of 2008 VP candidate Sarah Palin ' s Going Rogue .Bridget Jelinek isn ' t waiting , though , for a wave of anti intellectualism to sweep the gun toting ex governor into presidential office in 2012 . She ' s lobbying FBI Director Robert Mueller now to let AWE run workshops in which Bureau bigwigs would , through assisted reenactment of past domestic disputes and familial spats , come to better appreciate just how vile women can be . 	 1
NEW YORK A group of popular teenage girls viciously insulted the United States Tuesday , causing the populace to break down and cry following assertions that its 300 million citizens are stupid and fat and that everybody hates them .The elite clique , which consists of high school sophomores Ashley Powell , Courtney Hughes , and Marisa Reynolds , reportedly preyed on the nation ' s insecurities by mocking the way Americans were dressed and proclaiming that every U . S . resident was " a complete loser . "" Those girls are so cruel , " said Pittsburgh construction worker Joe Miller , wiping away tears from his eyes . " They made all these really mean comments about my weight and the way I smelled , and then one of them , I think it was Courtney , said that the color of my hard hat really brought out the ugliness in my face . "Added Miller , " I don ' t ever want to go back to that construction site ! "Sources confirmed the entire Midwest was filled with self doubt after the girls ridiculed the region by yawning in an exaggerated manner and declaring that everything its citizens had to say was " bor ing . "In addition , the girls ' merciless attacks left the state of Nebraska so mortified that all its residents stayed home the next morning , unable to go about their daily routines for fear of what the teenagers might be telling others about them .The exclusive trio of 16 year olds was reportedly at its most ruthless while tormenting the nation ' s women , upseting millions by spreading malicious rumors that every one of them was a complete slut . Ashley Powell , who publicly stated that they all looked like huge cows , is believed to be responsible for traumatizing the Eastern Seaboard and leaving all its female residents completely inconsolable ." They do this every time , " said 51 year old Portland , ME resident Sandra Thompson , who takes a different route to work each day in order to avoid the mean spirited clique . " You leave the house thinking you look great . Then they invite you over , smile that little perky smile of theirs , and tell you that your new skirt almost hides your huge ass . "Social worker Janet Martin , who said the popular teens were only using derision to overcome low self esteem , sobbed with her hands covering her face after the girls made fun of her low salary , meager benefits , and lack of career advancement opportunities .According to sources in his office , Houston mayor Bill White received an anonymous handwritten note from the teenagers last week stating that someone " super hot " had a huge crush him . When White followed the instructions in the message and arrived Saturday at the Willowbrook Mall food court holding a single red rose , he was embarrassed to discover the person waiting for him was Julie , that one fat girl with the braces .Though an overwhelming majority of the country fears being ostracized by the popular girls , many admitted they wished they could do something , anything , to be noticed by them ." It ' s like they don ' t even know I ' m alive , " said John Green , 91 , of Miami . " I don ' t know why I let it bother me . I ' ve lived a rich , rewarding life . But they ' re so pretty , and their hair is so perfect ! "" Why don ' t they like me ? " Davis continued . " What did I ever do to them ? "Even President Barack Obama wasn ' t spared from the popular teens ' contempt ." I was working hard on a plan to reduce U . S . oil consumption , and they were just sitting there smirking and pointing at me the whole time , " said Obama , who overheard the girls whispering that he shouldn ' t have bailed out the U . S . auto industry without first calling for stronger provisions to improve fuel efficiency . " But that ' s how they operate . They find one little flaw in your energy policy and relentlessly make fun of you for it . "" They ' re probably laughing at me right now , " Obama added . " I hate those girls ! "At press time , the group of girls reiterated its long held stance that no one in the nation has any friends . When asked for further comment , the teenagers pointed at reporters , giggled , and said , " Whatever . " 	 1

Worst President Ever , GW Bush , has released an economics report demonstrating that the War in Iraq has been an overwhelming financial success ." I did the arithmetic and when you calculate the worth of a human body and the oil profits spilling out of Iraq , even if you subtract the 50 stolen by insurgents like Halliburton , this war is a winner for oil men like me and Laura , " WPE GWB explained .He then whipped out an abacus from his holster and showed the proof :" How much is my body worth ? "When we total the monetary value of the elements in our bodies and the value of the average person ' s skin , we arrive at a net worth of 4 . 50 !The U . S . Bureau of Chemistry and Soils invested many a hard earned tax dollar in calculating the chemical and mineral composition of the human body , which breaks down as follows :Additionally , it was discovered that our bodies contain trace quantities of fluorine , silicon , manganese , zinc , copper , aluminum , and arsenic . Together , all of the above amounts to less than one dollar !Our most valuable asset is our skin , which the Japanese invested their time and money in measuring . The method the Imperial State Institute for Nutrition at Tokyo developed for measuring the amount of a person ' s skin is to take a naked person , and to apply a strong , thin paper to every surface of his body . After the paper dries , they carefully remove it , cut it into small pieces , and painstakingly total the person ' s measurements . Cut and dried , the average person is the proud owner of fourteen to eighteen square feet of skin , with the variables in this figure being height , weight , and breast size . Basing the skin ' s value on the selling price of cowhide , which is approximately . 25 per square foot , the value of an average person ' s skin is about 3 . 50 . "" Now factor in that oil is going at 100 per barrel and Iraq is producing thousands of these a day . We have more than covered the cost of the 4 , 000 US corpses . Now you may argue that there are tens of thousands of Iraqi stiffs and I hear that may be true . But when you consider what them poor bastards have eaten during the first five years of me and McCain ' s Hundred Year War . It don ' t amount to a hill of Iraqi garbanzos . I rest my case ! 	 1
According to an entertainment insider , porn star Rachel Oberlin and model Natalie Kenly simultaneously blew their breast implants while performing a sex act on Charlie Sheen at his Beverly Hills mansion Tuesday .The insider , a friend of Charlie ' s who had just come over to visit for the day , claims he heard screams of " Winning ! " " Winning " coming from Sheen ' s upstairs bedroom and then he heard what sounded like " two large pops . "" I swear , they were like cannons goin off in there ! "When the friend rushed into the bedroom , he found a naked Kenly straddled on Sheen in the famed cowgirl position ." They were crying and there was this plasma lookin ' stuff everywhere , " the source continued . " I immediately noticed two things :1 . Their breasts had shrunk from Christy Canyons to Betty Whites .2 . Charlie was wasted outta his mind . He was barely coherent , and he had on nothing but a " Screw Warner Bros T shirt . "The friend immediately called 911 and the girls were taken to nearby Cedars Sinai Medical Center .Sadly , their breasts had shriveled up too much to be saved . The girls are expected to recover though .Sheen eventually returned our calls about the incident Wednesday morning , saying , " They ' re fine ! These broads are my little angels ! They ' ll be back hot and cooking in no time !

Maine lawmakers drop effort to impeach combative governorMaine Governor Paul LePage speaks at the 23rd Annual Energy Trade and Technology Conference in Boston , Massachusetts November 13 , 2015 .AUGUSTA , Maine Maine lawmakers killed a motion on Thursday that would have marked the first step toward impeaching Republican Governor Paul LePage , whose blunt comments have often infuriated adversaries .The motion , presented on Thursday morning by eight Democrats and one independent , called for the creation of a legislative committee to investigate at least eight " allegations of misconduct " against LePage .Lawmakers seeking LePage ' s ouster contended he overstepped his authority when he threatened to withhold funds last year from a nonprofit that hired a political rival , among other charges .Legislators , including some of LePage ' s critics in the Democratic controlled state House of Representatives , voted 96 52 to postpone the motion indefinitely ." As I have said all along , this impeachment nonsense was nothing more than a political witch hunt that had absolutely no merit , " LePage said in a statement following the vote .The vote came a week after LePage drew criticism for saying out of state drug dealers were coming to Maine and impregnating " white girls . " Critics called the comments racist , while LePage told reporters he had misspoken .The majority of Democrats who spoke during a three hour long House debate favored an investigation of LePage ' s actions , but Republicans said the allegations against LePage would set the bar for impeachment proceedings too low ." What is going to be the standard , the threshold , next time that someone is disgruntled with the actions of a chief executive ? " asked Republican state Representative Ken Fredette .LePage has acknowledged threatening to withhold funding from a charter school for troubled youths , after it hired House Speaker Mark Eves , a Democrat , as president .LePage said he felt Eves was unqualified and had been offered the job as a political favor .Maine Attorney General Janet Mills , a Democrat often at odds with LePage , reviewed the charges but found no basis for a criminal investigation .Since taking office in 2011 as a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement , LePage has often engaged in a war of words with political opponents .

federal officials, amid the worst u. s. biosafety crisis in years, have dismissed 11 eminent scientists from a 23 member panel that advises the government on how and whether research on dangerous pathogens should be conducted. the purged members were informed that their service was no longer needed via an email on sunday night from mary groesch, executive director of the national science advisory board for biosecurity ( nsabb ). two of the dismissed members told reuters that the notice came without warning. the panel is overseen by the national institutes of health. serious safety concerns : the cdc has revealed still more safety breaches at some of its top level labs and 11 scientists from a 23 member safety panel were fired via email sunday nightthe action, first reported on science magazine's website, came two days after federal health officials released details of an investigation of the mishandling of anthrax samples by scientists at the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention. according to the independent, four of the scientists have since signed a petition to limit the types of research that may be done into highly dangerous flu types over fears of potential release. that probe turned up numerous additional breaches at cdc, igniting concerns about how scientists at the agency and nationwide handle dangerous microbes. in one newly disclosed incident, cdc scientists contaminated samples of low pathogenic bird flu viruses with a highly pathogenic strain and in march shipped them to a department of agriculture lab, where the viruses promptly killed all the chickens exposed to them. on wednesday, a subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the cdc's biosafety lapses.'add these to the long list of questions we have about how biosecurity is being managed,'said committee chairman fred upton, a michigan republican.'why hasn't the panel met in years, and why is now the time to dismiss nearly half the experts on this panel tasked with advising the administration on biosecurity?'string of mistakes : the action came following an investigation into lab safety brought on after dozens of lab technicians and cdc staff were potentially exposed to live anthrax due to human error in junein the sunday night email from nih, which was reviewed by reuters, groesch wrote that she'wanted to tell you that a new slate of nsabb members has been approved as your replacements, and thus your service on the board is ending.'' this may come as welcome news!'she wrote, adding that the departing members'will be missed.'an nih spokeswoman said in a statement on tuesday that'it is routine for federal advisory committees to rotate their membership over time so that fresh and diverse perspectives can be brought to bear,'and that the dismissed scientists'terms'had been renewed several times.'one of the dismissed members, michael imperiale of the university of michigan, tweeted that it was a'bizarre time to eliminate all institutional memory.'the biosecurity board does not approve particular experiments but offers policy advice on, among other things, oversight of'dual use'studies, meaning research that could be used for biowarfare or bioterrorism as well as for legitimate purposes. in 2012, for instance, the board recommended that details of experiments on an especially deadly form of avian influenza, h5n1, not be published. they feared the information could be used to create a strain that, unlike the natural form, is highly transmissible between infected people. another error : health officials have revealed that a bird flu breach occurred in addition to the anthrax debacle. a cdc lab sent another lab a sample that was supposed to be weak bird flu but had been contaminated with a potent strain and killed all the lab chickens exposed to itat the time, the board's concerns led to a 60 day self imposed moratorium on nih funded projects on h5n1. one of the dismissed board members expressed surprise that the purge included virtually all of the people with experience of the h5n1 debate and included experts known for communicating openly with fellow scientists and the public on biosafety issues. dr arturo casadevall of the albert einstein college of medicine in new york, for instance, co authored a 2012 editorial in the journal of the american society for microbiology on the h5n1 debate, calling for'a clear scientific rationale'for studies that enable pathogens to be more deadly or contagious than they are in nature. casadevall was dismissed from the advisory board on sunday night. also dismissed was microbiologist paul keim of northern arizona state university, who played a crucial role in the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people and infected another 17. keim's dna analysis of the anthrax mailed to u. s. senators and news organizations allowed investigators to trace the bacteria to an army 	 0
A 1 , 400 year old mass grave of decapitated prisoners of war has been discovered in the Mayan city of Uxul in Mexico .The 7th century grave contained dismembered skeletons of 24 victims , thought to have been prisoners of war , in what was once a water reservoir .The finding provides the first physical evidence that the violent murder of opponents , which was so often shown in Maya art , was in fact practiced .Scientists from the University of Bonn discover the remains of dismembered human bodies in an artificial cave in the Classic Maya city Uxul in Mexico . The image shows the artificial cave ' s interior during the excavations with several skulls , lower jaws and ribs' It is absolutely rare to find such a mass grave in the Maya area , ' Nicolaus Seefeld , who discovered the mass grave , told MailOnline .' The only other archaeological evidence of such a dismemberment of victims was in the site of Cancu n , Guatemala . 'Due to being covered by clay , the bones were so well preserved that it was possible to distinguish the age and sex of 15 of the 24 individuals .They included 13 men and two women who were aged from 18 to 42 at the time of their death .The mass grave was found in what was once a water reservoir . The light grey surfaces around the entrance is an impermeable stucco floor , which was destined to catch runoff and divert it into the interior of the reservoirAnalysis of teeth and bones showed that several of the deceased suffered from malnutrition and had lost several teeth to tooth decay .Some of the dead had tooth inserts of jade . The scientists interpreted this as a sign of high social status .The bones also provided clues about how each victim met their violent death .' I observed complete legs , whose bones were still in the correct anatomical articulation from the hip , to the femur , the kneecaps until the smallest toe bones , ' said Mr Seefeld .' Apart from that , I also observed other detached body parts such as severed heads , complete hands , detached feet . 'The image shows the left side of another individual ' s skull whose upper part has been entirely chopped off . The fine nature of the breaking edge shows that the destruction of this skull did not occurr after its depositionSome of the dead had tooth inserts of jade . The scientists interpret this as a sign of high social statusAfter cleaning the bones , Mr Seefeld found traces of the violent killing , such as blunt force trauma on the foreheads and traces of sharp blades , which had cut away parts of skulls and had severed the heads .' This observation excluded the possibility that this mass grave was a so called secondary burial , in which the bones of the deceased are placed at a new location ' , he said .Archaeologists from the University of Boon had been excavating in the historical Maya city of Uxul in Campeche for the past five years to uncover the origins and the collapse of regional states in the Maya lowlands .The image shows the bones of a complete foot , during the excavation . It shows how all the bones are still in the anatomical natural state , which means that the foot was severed from the rest of the body and was then immediately buried on the location where it was documentedSculpture from the late Mayan period depicts the sacrificial rites of an ancient ball game , at the end of which the captain of the losing team would be ritually decapitatedThe researchers do not yet know whether they are prisoners of war from another Mayan city or were sacrificed in Uxul or nobles from Uxul itself .Mr Seefeld is yet to excavate the western half of the water reservoir , and is hopeful more artefacts will be found .The project was headed by Dr Nikolai Grube and Dr Kai Delvendahl from the University of Bonn , as well as Dr Antonio Benavides from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History . 	 0
you're late for your flight, sweaty from having dragged your luggage to the check in counter, and stressed about making it through security before boarding begins. for some of us, this is the rule, not the exception. for most of us, it's a pretty unremarkable scenario. not so fast, says the transportation security administration. typical airport behavior like this could make you a suspicious traveler who should be subjected to questioning and additional screening and possibly referred to the police for investigation, detention or arrest. that should seem far fetched, but it isn't. the tsa continues to use pseudo scientific " behavior detection " techniques that have given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling at our nation's airports. through a program called screening passengers by observation techniques, or spot, the tsa employs thousands of " behavior detection officers " who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of " mal intent " in airport screening areas. the officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the tsa associates with stress, fear or deception. when the officers perceive clusters of such behaviors in any given individual, they refer that person for secondary inspection and questioning. the spot program relies on theories about " micro expressions, " involuntary facial expressions that supposedly appear for milliseconds despite one's efforts to conceal them. behavior detection officers look for such micro expressions while scanning passengers'faces or engaging in casual conversation with them. it's as nutty as it sounds. setting aside that the officers'perception of these behaviors is inherently subjective, there's just no evidence that deception or " mal intent " can reliably be detected through observation, especially in an unstructured setting like an airport screening area. the fact that many people find such settings inherently stressful only compounds the problem. if tsa's behavior detection officers look for stress in a stressful environment, they're going to find it, along with plenty of false positives. just about everyone outside the tsa who has reviewed the spot program has decided that it's unscientific and a waste of money. an exhaustive review by the government accountability office found the spot program lacked a scientific basis, that the behavioral indicators it relied on were subjective, and that the tsa had no effective means to test its effectiveness. in no uncertain terms, the gao recommended that congress curtail funding for the program. an independent scientific advisory group that reviewed the spot program also concluded that " no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior, including intent. " and during a congressional hearing on the program, republican rep. richard hudson of north carolina observed, " to my knowledge, there has not been a single instance where a behavior detection officer has referred someone to a law enforcement officer and that individual turned out to be a terrorist. " rep. michael mccaul of texas, the republican chairman of the house homeland security committee, stated, " i am concerned that tsa will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach. " despite this withering criticism, spot remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over 1 billion ( that's with a b ) since its inception in 2007. repeat : over a billion dollars on a misguided program that doesn't work. equally troubling is that spot has given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling an unfortunately inevitable result when law enforcement or border agents single people out based on hasty, gut level judgments about them. allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers have come not only from travelers, but also from numerous other officers. over 30 behavior detection officers at boston logan international airport said that profiling was rampant there. one of the officers told reporters, " they just pull aside anyone who they don't like the way they look if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewelry, or if they are hispanic. " another officer submitted an anonymous complaint saying, " the behavior detection program is no longer a behavior based program, but it is a racial profiling program. " the tsa has not revealed what, if any, steps it has taken to ensure that unlawful profiling does not occur in airport screening. nor has tsa explained why despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary spot contributes meaningfully to aviation security. that's why the aclu submitted an foia request to tsa seeking information on its use of behavior detection. we've received no response, so we're taking the tsa to court to get the information the public needs to fully evaluate it. people expect that when they travel, they will be screened for weapons or explosives that could bring down an airplane. they don't expect nor should they that officers will make probing judgments about their intentions based on little more than their facial expressions, or that they will be stopped, questioned and perhaps even searched because of their race or ethnicity. 	 0
chappaqua, ny after months of tirelessly supporting his wife on the campaign trail, devoted spouse and former president bill clinton breathed a resigned sigh monday and carefully folded the charcoal silk, fitted sheath dress he had hoped to wear as first lady during next january's inauguration and placed it back in its beautiful box. the 61 year old clinton, who has appeared on the covers of both time and newsweek and has recently been lauded for his work as an outspoken advocate for human rights, purchased the christian dior gown earlier this year after wife hillary announced her bid for the presidency. though he has promised to stand by her until rival barack obama is officially named the democratic nominee in august, clinton told friends that he " could not bear " to look at the dress any longer. " a beautiful gown like this shouldn't be wasted on any but the most special of occasions, " said clinton, who, before packing the garment away, spent a quiet moment running his fingers over the expert stitching and delicate cascade of ruffles. " no. this dress deserves to be worn by a real first lady. " after slowly tying the original silk bow around the box and clutching it to his chest for 45 seconds, the former world leader gently placed the dress inside his so called " first lady hope chest. " sources close to the clintons have confirmed that the chest includes items the 42nd president had planned to bring with him to a hillary led white house, among them a pair of unworn white satin gloves, some hand blown glass christmas ornaments, a pewter locket bearing a portrait of his mother, a pressed daisy, two pearl drop earrings, and a handful of wallpaper and fabric swatches. " my, my, would you just look at this all dressed up and no place to go, " said clinton, removing a ruby brooch from a small box marked " final iraq pullout. " " i suppose the american people want better for their first lady than some pie eyed boy from arkansas with a head full of dreams and all the grace of a peeled potato. i only hope michelle obama or cindy hensley mccain will have the courage to change those hideous drapes in the lincoln bedroom. " while clinton has vowed never to wear the outfit publicly, he admitted to removing the gown from its box once before, after hillary won the california and new york primaries. on that occasion, clinton reportedly stood before his bedroom mirror, held the bodice to his torso, straightened his posture before extending a gloved hand outward and, in honeyed, lilting tones, repeated the line, " oh, this old thing? prime minister fukuda, you do go on. " despite her husband's charm and optimism, sen. clinton was unable to gain enough delegates to secure the democratic nomination and will return to her seat in the u. s. senate. after she announced the suspension of her 212 million campaign, former president clinton told reporters he was " devastated " that he would never have the chance to stand before the american people on the capitol steps in the timeless elegance of dior. " it was silly of me to waste so much money on such an extravagant outfit, but when i saw it in the store, i thought to myself,'bill, that's your inauguration dress,'" clinton said. " i suppose it's for the best, though. knowing me, i would have spilled champagne all over it. still, can you imagine? " clinton has denied rumors that he will wear the high necked, cap sleeve frock at an upcoming gala at arkansas children's hospital. he has also refused to give the one of a kind gown to his daughter, chelsea, saying she is still years away from getting married and " doesn't have the waist for it. " clinton added that the most upsetting aspect of packing the tailored first lady dress away was that it meant recognizing that his decades old dream of being first lady would never come true. " i remember watching president john f. kennedy's inauguration, " said clinton, clasping his hands to his chest and staring off into the distance. " it was jan. 20, 1961. he placed his hand on the bible as everyone watched and took the oath in front of god and chief justice earl warren. and there beside him was jackie. oh, jackie. in that pillbox hat and that glorious oleg cassini masterpiece in greige wool melton. she was a wonder. " " i remember thinking,'someday, i'll be president,'" clinton continued, "'and then, eight years later and largely owing to my own massive public appeal, my wife will become president and i can be the prettiest first lady there ever was.'" at press time, clinton was seen in a low cut black evening gown holding two bottles of champagne as he attempted to gain access to sen. barack obama's campaign bus, telling reporters he only wished to 	 1
Why Eric Holder ' s endorsement of Hillary Clinton might matterHillary Clinton secured an endorsement from the nation ' s first black attorney general . Why that might matter in the Democratic primary . ?Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames , Iowa , Tuesday , Jan . 12 , 2016 .Charleston , S . C . ? As she works to maintain an advantage among African American voters in her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination , Hillary Clinton has secured an endorsement from the nation ' s first black attorney general .The Clinton campaign announced Eric Holder ' s support in a statement to the Associated Press .Holder , who served as President Barack Obama ' s top law enforcement appointee for more than five years , said Clinton " is the candidate that we need in the White House " to continue " the progress of President Obama . "Photos of the Day Photos of the day 01 12Holder ' s statement cited a list of policy areas that Clinton has highlighted in her battle against Vermont Sen . Bernie Sanders , including several that resonate strongly among black voters .African American voters favor Clinton by a wide margin according to preference polls , and they will likely make up a majority of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina ' s Feb . 27 primary and potentially in other Southern primaries that follow in March .Holder said Clinton " has bold plans to address police brutality , fight for common sense reforms to our gun laws . " He did not name Sanders , instead focusing on Republicans he said would " tear down our progress on civil rights , health care and curbing gun violence . "South Carolina is the only one of the initial four states to vote where black voters anchor the Democratic Party base of support . While polls in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire show Sanders either leading or nearly deadlocked with Clinton , her advantage among black voters leaves her with a commanding lead in South Carolina .Yet , in ? a Jan . 12 poll ? by Quinnipiac University , Sanders is leading challenger Hilary Clinton in Iowa , 49 percent to 44 percent . Trailing far behind at just 4 points is former Maryland Gov . Martin O ' Malley . In New Hampshire , a Monmouth University poll has Sanders ahead of Clinton , 53 percent to 39 percent . Other polls conducted by American Research Group and NBC Marist Wall Street Journal have Sanders over Clinton by only three points , but ? leading nonetheless . ?The former secretary of state conceivably could lose Iowa and New Hampshire but quickly regain the upper hand in the nominating contest by winning in South Carolina and several other Southern states that follow .Clinton has in recent weeks emphasized her support for tougher gun laws , aligning herself with Obama and trying to paint Sanders as an ally of gun manufacturers based on some of his previous votes in the Senate . Sanders supports Obama ' s recent executive action to expand background checks on certain gun purchases , but he has also argued that rural communities , like those he represents in Vermont , rightfully view gun restrictions more skeptically than many urban residents , including many African Americans .Gun violence is particularly important to black voters in South Carolina . In North Charleston last April , a white police officer was captured on video shooting and killing an unarmed black man , Walter Scott . The officer has since been fired and charged with murder .In June , a white gunman entered a historically black church in Charleston and killed the minister and eight others , drawing a national outcry .Sanders and his aides acknowledge Clinton ' s advantage among black Democrats , and the Vermont senator has concentrated ad spending in the state on radio stations aimed at African Americans . The message focuses heavily on his pitch for greater economic opportunity and an end to mass incarceration that disproportionately affects young black males .Tad Devine , Sanders ' top media consultant , called the ads " effective " and said the question is whether Sanders has a enough time to reach more black voters before the Feb . 20 primary in South Carolina and the March primaries across the South . 	 0

Although most items are cheaper , the savings vary and we did find examples of popular Christmas gifts that were more expensive in New York so it will pay to check carefully before splashing the cash to avoid costly mistakes .' Sterling has risen quite significantly in value against European currencies this year , which means that city break holidaymakers will have more cash to spend .' However , it is still important for them to check prices and factor in all the costs they will incur on a Christmas Markets trip .' Holiday homework will show that short breaks to eastern European cities like Prague and Riga are hard to beat for value . ' 	 0
Real Madrid sent shockwaves through the world of sport last night by unveiling Al Qaeda leader and renowned enemy of America Osama Bin Laden as their newest recruit in a Summer spending spree which has also seen them sign Christoph ' New York ' Metzhelder , Pepe and Royston ' Don ' t call me Roy ' Drenthe .George W . Bush was understandably quick to condemn the move , describing it as ' deplorable ' , ' insulting ' and ' a total embarrassment since I thought I ' d nuked this guy ' , while presidential candidate Hilary Clinton admitted her shock , especially since she felt what they really needed was ' a new left back to replace Roberto Carlos ' ( as we all know , Osama is a right winger , having winged it many times from the FBI ) .Coach Bernd Schuster however , hit back : " They ' re just jealous that we captured Osama . He ' s a real steal . "And that ' real steal ' is the subject of an Al Qaeda complaint , who allege that Bin Laden was tapped up by the Spanish giants :" Osama had four years left on his contract . We ' re not happy with Madrid ' s conduct and shall be contacting FIFA about this matter . "Real deny these allegations :" We went through the proper channels . . . and caves " .Pedrag ' Queen ' Mijatovic , director of football , was quick to explain the club ' s transfer policy amidst uproar from several quarters :" We were sitting around at a board meeting trying to think of someone to replace Beckham . So we thought to ourselves ' Who ' s more famous than Beckham ? " . . . and that ' s when it hit us Osama Bin Laden ! "However , the former Yugoslavia international responded angrily to claims that Bin Laden was , much like Beckham , just another marketing ploy to exploit the untapped market of Afganistan , though he did admit that they would be touring the region ' as soon as we can find a good bomb shelter ' and that Bin Laden was ' a bit of a one trick pony ' and would be ' primarily used as a supersub ' .Sales of Bin Laden shirts have gone through the roof in Kabul well they would ' ve gone through the roof if all the roofs hadn ' t been bombed and are particularly popular with young Muslim terrorists .However , stalwart Guti expressed doubts that the transfer would succeed :" It looks like the galactico policy is back again . I just hope this guy isn ' t a disruptive influence in the dressing room what with his whole ' I hate America . Let ' s bomb it ' schtick . I just like to chill out . "Rumours that Antonio Cassano had been sent the other way as part of the deal were met with silence , though Raul did hint that this may be the case when he said :" He was a fat prat anyway . " 	 1

Clinton invokes 9 11 in countering criticism of Wall St . donations , takes heatNov . 14 , 2015 : Hillary Rodham Clinton shakes hands with Martin O ' Malley after a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines , Iowa . ? ( AP )Hillary Clinton invoked the 9 11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night s debate , a response that drew bipartisan criticism .The former New York senator made the reference after Vermont Sen . Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry .I represented New York , and I represented New York on 9 11 when we were attacked , Clinton pointed out . Where were we attacked ? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is . I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild . That was good for New York .Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended .I n a new low , Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9 11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors , he said in a statement .The backlash also surfaced during the CBS hosted debate itself . Shortly after Clinton made the remarks , the moderators cited social media reaction , including a tweet saying she had invoked 9 11 to justify Wall Street donations .Well , I ' m sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9 11 for my entire first term to rebuild , Clinton said .Sanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild . But he also said Wall Street has too much power .Earlier , he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her .Let ' s not be naive about it . Why has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton ? he said . You know , maybe they ' re dumb and they don ' t know what they ' re going to get , but I don ' t think so .Even Clinton s former campaign manager , Patti Solis Doyle , questioned the 9 11 reference following the debate .I do think that the 9 11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism . She was the senator when the 9 11 attacks happened . She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city . And it would have been more powerful talking about terrorism , she said on CNN . 	 0

New York City Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came out of the poor house long enough today , on her current book tour , to confess to the world how hard her life has been . She and former President Clinton were " dead broke . "Clinton , speaking to Diane Sawyer , revealed for the first time that she and Bill were both members of the real family that The Beverly Hillbillies TV show was based on . That explains Chelsea .During her early years , Clinton ' s family was so poor they could only afford to send her to law school . It sure sounds like she grew up on the mean streets of Chicago .After the lean college years , Hillary married Bill and they subsisted on salaries in the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as Bill slogged through eight years in the presidency and she lived the life of luxury few ever get to experience .Fortunately , the couple was still receiving royalty checks from the TV show after selling their life story to Hollywood to help them survive this difficult period .Sadly , once they left their opulent life in the White House , the Clinton ' s were back to eating mac and cheese and beans every night since Hillary ' s only income was from her eight million dollar advance for a book deal .Bill could only chip in his own multi million dollar book deal and tens of thousands of dollars per speech he would deliver from time to time .Life had them down and then it kicked them in the heads when they were simply trying to obtain mortgages for two houses , each averaging around five million dollars . They had to live somewhere !Finally , the couple seems to be getting on their feet financially just as Hillary is potentially seeking a run for her own presidency .Experts marvel at how the couple have somehow survived on only millions of dollars a year .Hillary is just glad she can relate to the common folk , having faced so many of the same financial struggles that her poor constituents , who make only a small fraction of what she makes , deal with on a daily basis . Year after year . Decade after decade . Just like she did . 	 1
it was in a radio interview in november when spain coach vicente del bosque, tired of managers pushing their players under his nose saying he should'call up this one'or'take a look at that one ', said :'why does no one ever ask me about adrian the west ham goalkeeper?'a slightly surprised silence among studio presenters gave way to a consensus that amounted to : good question, why does no one ever talk about adrian? two months later and more people are talking about the west ham goalkeeper than ever before. jose mourinho, not prone to agreeing with del bosque, said after adrian's performance against his team on boxing day :'he was marvellous, just as he was marvellous last season '. west ham goalkeeper adrian could be in for an unexpected call up to the spain squad this yearsportsmail's pete jenson ( right ) caught up with the goalkeeper at west ham's training groundspain stays glued to the premier league during la liga's winter break and adrian's performances only enhanced his chances of becoming no 3 behind iker casillas and david de gea when the next squad is announced in march.'i heard what del bosque said and it's honour,'he says at west ham's training ground.'it's not just that he spoke about me but that he was the one who brought my name up. no one asked him.'another famous spain no 3, pepe reina, is one of the major reasons why a 28 year old from seville is now plying his trade in east london.'i know pepe very well and i spoke with him before i signed for west ham,'adrian says.'he told me : " do it, don't hesitate. the premier league is a great opportunity and you'll enjoy it hugely just as i enjoyed those years at liverpool ".'he doesn't regret taking the advice.'it wins you over more with every game. there is never a match when it seems one of the two teams believe they can't win. there are times in spain when you have a team playing one of the big sides and because they have so much respect for them the attitude is " let's defend and not lose by too many ". here everyone goes for it. everyone is brave.'spain manager vicente del bosque has talked up adrian's chances of getting an international opportunityadrian admitted he was delighted to hear the encouraging words of the spain boss earlier this seasonmanchester united's david de gea's position as spain no 1 looks solid for years to comenot that switching from spain to the premier league was easy. as with de gea, there were adjustments for adrian to make.'the play is a lot more physical here, there are a lot more high balls into the area and the refereeing is different,'he says.'in spain the slightest push on the keeper, especially if he goes down, the referee will blow. you have to watch the flight of the ball and dodge the challenges.'that's the biggest difference but i have adapted well. i was good in the air in spain and i'm big enough to cope so that has helped.'there were other adjustments to make. spanish goalkeepers are more prone to punch than catch and tend to be more comfortable using their feet. you can't imagine sam allardyce favours a punching playmaker between the posts.'it's true that here they don't like you to punch,'adrian says,'but sometimes when the area is crowded and you try to catch you can get a nudge from someone, the ball gets away, and if they don't blow for a foul it's a goal. sometimes a good punch will clear the ball very effectively so you have to mix it up. with passing the ball out from the back you can't be taking unnecessary risks, but if you are decisive then there shouldn't be a problem.'adrian was a late starter, not taking up the gloves until he was 11 and not breaking into the real betis first team until 25.'i was an outfield player before i was a goalkeeper,'he says.'i played up front until i was 10 and i loved to score goals but when my under 11 team cd altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked : " who wants to go in goal?

mound city, ks a ribbon of blacktop called highway 52 runs through the heart of this tiny eastern kansas town. not much distinguishes this road from countless others, except for the violent, head on collision that, on the evening of april 24, claimed the lives of five people from the town of mound city. it is on the shoulder of this otherwise ordinary road that a makeshift shrine to the victims has been erected. with plastic flowers, stuffed animals, and hand painted signs, the grieving townspeople of mound city resolved to consecrate the death site in the most trite and hackneyed way possible. " this is a truly tragic event, " said mound city resident trudy pierstorff. " it's painful enough to lose one person you know, but five, well, it boggles the mind. i'm going out to the site today to pay my respects and leave a few mylar balloons. " according to the linn county sheriff's department, jason gullickson, 18, was heading north to nearby pleasanton at a speed approaching 90 mph when he lost control of his 1992 plymouth sundance and collided with a ford taurus in the opposite lane driven by 42 year old james drabeck. drabeck, his wife alma, 40, and daughter kelly, 13, died instantly. gullickson and a passenger, kimberly femia, 17, died later of massive head injuries. a second passenger, 17 year old michael allen, survived the crash but remains in critical condition at methodist medical center in pleasanton. to cope with this incalculable loss of life, within hours of the accident, the citizens of mound city responded with a spontaneous outpouring of crappy mementos. despite the presence of such disturbing reminders of the crash as tire marks, headlight shards, and blood stained pavement, mound city residents have come here day after day, adding more tacky shit to the steadily growing pile. " it's staggering to think we won't be seeing jason and kimberly anymore, " said mound city high school english teacher john pentland, who laid two synthetic red roses with plastic baby's breath atop the ever growing heap of embarrassing kitsch. " i've been having nightmares every night since the accident, " said lynette searcy, 38, sister of james drabeck. " but somehow, i know that jim, alma, and kelly are with god in heaven now. " searcy then honored her deceased family members with a crocheted clown doll in a tiny kansas city chiefs t shirt. passersby on hwy. 52 also stopped to pay their respects. off duty sheriff's deputy scott tierney was moved by the tribute. " i'm a family man like james drabeck, and it's sobering to think that everything can disappear like that in the wink of an eye, " tierney said. " he must have been quite a guy to warrant that purple horse pi ata. " it is not just tasteless bric a brac that makes up the shrine : ill conceived signs and corny poems abound, as well. friends of gullickson felt the best way to tell the world how much they missed him was with the words " see you at the crossroads " written in glow in the dark green paint on a slab of cardboard. bordering the sign was a collage of items representing jason's favorite things, including a mound city mustangs logo, several icehouse beer labels, and a crudely cut out image of jesus christ. " you and jason were so great togeather sic, " reads a poem to femia from classmate danielle schoyer. " i liked having deca and choir with you you were looking so forward to the senior class trip to washington i will throw a coin in the potamac sic for you. " though the remainder of the poem was illegible, its ink washed out by an overnight drizzle, it no doubt continued in this mawkish vein. allen, the lone survivor of the crash, has not been spared the tawdry tributes. stuffed pandas, bouquets of carnations, and " stone cold " steve austin balloons adorn his hospital room, as well as a construction paper placard bearing the proclamation " u r a hero!!! " spelled in macaroni and glitter. " i'm sure once michael regains consciousness, he'll be glad so many people are pulling for him, " said andrea allen, michael's mother. " a few days ago, he was awake long enough to see the sign and ask,'how was i a hero, mom? i was in a car accident.'then he slipped out of consciousness again. i'm sure the painkillers are clouding his reasoning.

WASHINGTON Millions of Americans and thousands of federal employees awoke Monday to find the national mail service in disarray after a group of rowdy teens on a joyride reportedly destroyed up to 90 percent of the postal service ' s nationwide infrastructure with a baseball bat .Citing more than 45 billion in damages from the late night escapade , the United States Postal Service has suspended all mail delivery and requested relief aid to rebuild more than 650 demolished post offices . The agency is also seeking supplemental funding to clean up the letters , packages , and crushed Budweiser can the teens left in their wake ." These hooligans have absolutely no respect for property , fellow residents , or their country , " Postmaster General John E . Potter said as he picked up pieces of the USPS headquarters that had flown across the street and into a neighboring yard . " This is the third postal service I ' ve had to replace this year . "According to police documents , Potter told investigators he was working late at his office Sunday night when , around 11 : 30 p . m . , he heard the sound of a loud muffler and rock music coming from outside USPS headquarters . Potter said he ran outside to see what was happening , but by the time he arrived the teens were speeding off down a gravel road , giving him only enough time to throw a crab apple at the departing car , which he described as " a rusted out old Buick . "Authorities have thus far not been able to identify the teens responsible , who remain at large and in serious trouble ." It ' s those Murphy twins and their no good friend Tim Strougle , " Potter said while shaking a broom . " What they did was destruction of property , plain and simple . Those kids should know better than to tamper with a federal mail service agency it ' s a felony . "Potter went on to argue that the irresponsible teens should have to personally pay the rebuilding costs of his agency ' s infrastructure , a punishment he believes would " teach them a lesson they won ' t soon forget . "Added Potter , " Someone ' s going to have to spend a whole day digging a new hole for that foundation . "Though FBI agents assigned to investigate the nationwide act of vandalism would not comment on any potential leads , they did disclose that the task force has ruled out a number of suspects , including those two Anderson boys from just up on Hoyt Road ." Sure , they ' ve gotten into trouble in the past , but their father Dave Anderson set them straight after the shenanigans they pulled last Halloween , " said Special Agent Brian Richards , who told reporters the FBI was enlisting the help of municipal law enforcement agencies and snoopy neighbors from across the country in the investigation . " Nor do we have reason to believe that Shane and Lance McMurray were involved in this terrible crime . They ' re good boys . Mowed my lawn last summer . "Tampa resident Eric Thompson , 39 , was one of countless American citizens outraged by the night of teenage mischief ." I just don ' t get it , " said Thompson , standing in front of his broken local postal branch . " Why would someone want to ruin a perfectly good post office ? Don ' t they have anything better to do ? If this is what kids today do for fun , I don ' t know what to tell you . "Added Thompson : " Now I ' m not going to get my magazines until who knows when . "While many Americans remain convinced that whichever local teens are responsible should be punished to the full extent of the law , some feel the public is overreacting ." Everyone ' s getting all riled up over nothing , " Attorney General Michael Mukasey said . " The U . S . Postal Service got a little banged up so what ? We did the same thing when we were younger . "" Who knows , maybe old man Barrington ran over the damn things , " Mukasey added . " He shouldn ' t even have a license anymore , he ' s so darn nearsighted . I wouldn ' t be surprised if he knocked over all those buildings and didn ' t even realize he did it . "On Tuesday , the USPS announced they have begun taking extreme measures to prevent further destruction of federal property . As part of the new strategy , beginning next month security officers will take posts in the bushes surrounding USPS facilities in all major cities , and a select number of new offices will be reinforced by constructing a smaller office inside a large post office and filling the middle portion with cement ." I can ' t wait for one of those punks to take a swing at one of our mail centers after that , " Potter said .According to FBI records , the destruction of the U . S . Postal Service was the most significant incident of rampaging teens since the entire U . S . Air Force was keyed during the homecoming in 1998 . 	 1
President Clinton an nounced today that after 20 years and a slow , painful healing process , the U . S . will again invade Vietnam . " For a long time , we have said we don ' t need another Viet nam , " Clinton told a joint session of Congress . " But now , more than ever , America needs to be divided . We need another Vietnam . "American ground troops will be flown in via helicopters to ransack villages . Unrelenting napalm bombing missions will obliterate thousands of acres of Vietnamese farmland and rain forest . Clinton also plans to use chemical weapons like Agent Orange to inflict long term physical damage to Vietnamese civilians and American soldiers alike . " Furthermore , " Clinton said , " I believe the time is right for American soldiers to rape and kill more Vietnamese women and children . "Clinton urged our nation ' s young people to do their part by organizing protests against the war ." It is up to the younger generation to put a wedge in our national pride , and make the soldiers doubt their mission overseas , " he said . " I want to see flags burning on our campuses . " The president promised to order National Guardsmen to shoot students who engage in protest of any kind .Eighteen to 30 year olds are being conscripted by the thousands at local armed forces recruiting offices . But many eligible men are burning their draft cards and escaping to universities , seminaries or Canada . Clinton applauded these men for helping create a class war ." With your help , " he said , " America can be split into the haves and the have nots . Those with the means will escape the war , while those without will be sent overseas to die . "Clinton said he hopes the majority of those who die are impoverished blacks , or at the very least , poor white southerners .Clinton called on the Vietnamese to take as many U . S . prisoners as they can . " Only then can we , as a nation , be truly demoralized by war , " Clinton said . The president looks forward to hearing tales many years from now of brutal , unspeakable torture , and of the dehumanization of U . S . soldiers in POW camps . He promised that his administration would do very little to return the soldiers when the war is over .The president promised that soldiers will be heckled and spat upon when returning to America after the war . " I myself will stand by the transport planes when our soldiers come back , and I ' ll yell , ' Babykiller ! ' "Clinton urged soldiers to impregnate Vietnamese women during the war so their half Vietnamese children will be shunned from birth as Yankee blooded freaks . " And in many years , " Clinton said , " when those children come here to find their fathers , we will stand united and call them freaks , and send them back . "Clinton said he hopes to see news footage even more disturbing than the famous film of the Vietnamese youth being shot in the head at point blank range by a laughing U . S . general . " And that picture of the naked Vietnamese girl running through the streets as her village burns behind her . I want to see more pictures like that one . "The war will be fought half heartedly until January 2000 . 	 1
( Washington D . C . ) Republican lawmakers today passed the first of a series of bills authorizing the use of the Keystone Pipeline as a " humane and cost effective method for transporting illegal Mexican aliens back to their homeland . "The legislation also appropriates 1 . 3 billion dollars to build feeder extensions of the pipeline throughout the country in order to avoid bottlenecks at what will be known as Launch Centers , where deportees will begin their lawful journey south .Congressional leaders initially thought the bill would face stiff resistance among moderate Republicans , but after a PowerPoint presentation of a secret pilot project which had already successfully repatriated 75 , 000 aliens through the pipeline , the legislation cruised through both chambers only one Democrat voted for the bill ." We were exceedingly careful to ensure that this method would be , above all , thoroughly safe for those being transported . It ' s a victory of technology really , " said the bill ' s co sponsor , Representative Mo Brooks ( R Alabama ) . " There were those who scoffed at our vision , as if we were merely shoving human beings into a sealed pipe and letting them flow downhill in an oilstream . That ' s as barbaric as it is absurd . We had some of the best scientific minds in the nation working on this system . In the pilot , we had not one single injury a few complaints , but not one fatality . Not one ! Out of 75 , 000 deportees . "Slim titanium capsules low cost versions of a deep sea submersible manufactured by Baker Hughes deliver aliens one at a time from Launch Centers to Espiga de Bienvenida ( The Welcoming Spigot ) in the city of Heroica Matamoros in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas . The tiny capsules , first developed by scientists at Bryan College and funded largely by the Discovery Institute , are equipped with ample water and oxygen , pencils , sketch pads and Chinese stress balls it has been reported that they offer an almost womblike ride within the flow of oil . The capsules reach speeds upwards of 120 mph trips down the pipeline range from 3 minutes to several hours , depending on where the alien is inserted into Keystone ." There ' s not one of us on our side of the Technology Subcommittee that didn ' t first take a test ride in the capsules , " said Rep . Don Young ( R Alaska ) . " And so we speak with authority on the comfort and safety of the vehicle we wouldn ' t think of exposing others to what we ourselves would seek to avoid . " Young later clarified his statements , admitting that his caucus didn ' t actually get inserted into the pipeline , but traveled in an open air capsule simulator down the length of the corridor in the east wing of the Capitol . " Even so , " said the congressman , " it was fun , kinda like a bobsled run . "The bill ' s other co sponsor , Senator Jesse Helms , Jr . ( R NC ) , said , " I have every faith in the system , the vehicle the process . I imagine the trip to be something like the journey of cells through the bloodstream Something soothing and life affirming . Like , you know , carbamide or something , just gliding along in the noble blood . "Representative Brooks added that the deportation system would save " about thirty cents per taxpayer per annum " over traditional methods of busing illegals . " People die in vans and buses . Every year too many to count . But do you know how many people died last year in pipelines ? Zero . Yeah , that ' s right . Zero : that ' s how many ! "Although the Keystone Pipeline originates in Alberta at the Hardisty Terminal , Canada announced it would not be participating in the initiative . 	 1
In a rare moment of unscripted candidness , American President George Bush spent time away from answering questions at a recent speech to students at the University of Kansas to voice his displeasures and concerns about small countries ." Small countries complicate everything and end up attacking each other a lot , " the President stated , " not to mention that it ' s hard to find them on maps . "Bush said he remembered the simplicity of the Cold War , and sometimes wished back to the days when there were only two countries in the world ." Even though we didn ' t like each other , at least we knew where the other guy was coming from . Nowadays , I can barely keep up with all these new countries , let alone know what they want . Sure , I can still find Russia , and Canada , and China ' s not too much trouble , and Australia ' s the big island . But the rest of them , it can be difficult . "As for Mexico , " It ' s not really small , but it ' d still be better if we could make a state out of it . "Bush then praised the pioneering efforts of the European Union to simplify the world ' s geography ." At a time when countries seem to be splitting up rather than joining together , I applaud the efforts of the European Union to act a little bit more selflessly , " said Bush . Adding , " It ' s about time a fairly big country like Germany took matters into its own hands and decided to unite the continent . "Still , according to the President , the European Union is the exception . And there are plenty of examples of small countries only leading to trouble ." Take the Middle East . The biggest trouble spot in the world today , and it ' s absolutely filled with dinky , little countries . But just imagine how quickly they ' d all make peace if someone went there and made a Middle Eastern Union . One country , no more fighting . "This need to unite was especially true of countries with similar sounding names , Bush continued ." Iraq and Iran are right next to each other and only one letter different . Why are they two countries ? If they ' d have joined together five or six years ago , then we ' d only have to invade once . And God Almighty knows what the world needs is less wars . "Asked if that was a reasonable and realistic solution , Bush answered by drawing on the experience of the United States itself ." Just look at us . We ' re a great example of what I ' m talking about . Each of our states is like a little country in itself , but we ' ve got a whole fifty of them in what we call America . Now , wouldn ' t the whole international situation be a heck of a lot simpler if North and South Korea just followed the lead of North and South Dakota ? "Bush then switched tone , becoming more philosophical , as he speculated on how smaller states would fare in the arena of politics in the years to come ." I don ' t think they ' ll do well , " the President stated bluntly . " Just imagine what it ' ll be like once we discover extra terrestrial lifeforms . The big countries won ' t have any problems , because you can see them well enough from up in space . But if you ' re one of those small countries , then how are the aliens ever going to see you , let alone be able to make out what you ' re called . "He then held up a map of the world and demonstrated how larger countries will take the lead in inter planetary trade based on the fact that they have more physical space on which to write their names ." The United States , for example , will be able to use a much bigger font than , say , Greece . As a result , Americans will thrive in the Martian markets while the Grecians will fall more and more behind . "The American President finished his speech by thanking the enraptured students but urging patience and caution ." Obviously , a world government , one really big country , will be an ideal solution for the future . But we need to take baby steps first . After all , small countries are countries , too . And they can tie up military resources just like the big ones . You can ' t change horses in mid stream until the mission ' s accomplished , " he concluded . 	 1
Are you a smoker who uses a pub in Westminster ? Do you carelessly drop your cigarette butt on the ground ? From October you could end up being exterminated .This is a new measure by Westminster City Council to deal with the problems of discarded cigarette butts found outside buildings in the area . Yesterday a source in the council revealed that the council has ordered 5 , 000 daleks , famous for their appearances in the long running Doctor Who series screened between the 1960 ' s and 1980 ' s . This is as part of a zero tolerance measure to deal with smokers who carelessly drop their cigarette butts on the street .' Cigarette butts left on the street has become a major problem in Westminster , ' a council spokeswoman revealed , ' Every day our street cleaners remove three tons of cigarette butts from pavements throughout the borough which poses an additional risk of cancer for our street cleaners . Metal ashtrays have been provided but people still don ' t use them . It ' s time to take action . 'From October all 5 , 000 daleks will patrol the streets of Westminster looking out for smokers who drop their butts . The daleks have been specially programmed to exterminate automatically all culprits .However those exterminated don ' t die . ' We have fitted the daleks with special lasers which when in contact with their target have a severe laxative effect , ' the spokeswoman explained , ' As smokers tend to cough they will just have to be very careful about their smoking or face the risk of having unpleasant accidents . 'Neither Boris Johnson , the Mayor of London , nor the BBC were available for comment .Boris Johnson is 28 . 	 1
During Andy Murray ' s victorious run at the US Open two years ago , Jo Wilfried Tsonga issued a cri de coeur that got somewhat overlooked at the time .The gifted Frenchman had been knocked out in the second round and was reflecting on the frustration of playing in the era of the then dominant trio of Rafael Nadal , Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic .Striking an unusual tone of despair for such a genial and easygoing man , he said : ' I work hard every week , I give a lot of myself every day but I never get rewards . That ' s why sometimes it ' s tough . I ' m not a machine . 'Barely a week later Murray had won his first Grand Slam title , and Tsonga ' s words became a measure of his achievement .VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail ' s Mike DIckson preview Murray vs TsongaTest : Andy Murray will take on Jo Wilfried Tsonga for a place in the quarter finals of the US OpenFederer , Aus Open QF : lost 6 3 , 6 4 , 6 7 , 6 3 .Djokovic , Miami Open QF : lost 7 5 , 6 3 .Nadal , Italian Open QF : lost 1 6 , 6 3 , 7 5 .Nadal , French Open SF : lost 6 3 , 6 2 , 6 1 .Federer , Cincinnati Masters QF : lost 6 3 , 7 5 .The mercurial man from Le Mans has carried on since as one of those players Czech Tomas Berdych is another who at a different time in history would have been good enough to claim one of the sport ' s biggest prizes .Sometimes this has sapped his motivation , but he arrives for his fourth round appointment with Murray , which begins at around 7 : 30pm UK time on Sunday , at a time when his enthusiasm has been fully rekindled and he is ready for the fight .They are trying to reach the quarter finals , a stage made by Caroline Wozniacki , who out slugged Maria Sharapova 6 4 , 2 6 , 6 2 on Sunday to score a hugely popular win and become one of only four top 10 players left in the women ' s event .Undone : The British No 1 has a poor record against players in the top 10 so far in 2014Sharapova was given a code violation for time wasting and her slow play aggravated the Dane , whose career revival continues after her split from Rory McIlroy .Tsonga underwent a revival of his own when victory earlier this month in the Canadian Open got him inspired after a mediocre first half of the season . In Toronto he defeated Murray , Djokovic , Federer and Grigor Dimitrov all in the same week .The quarter final against Murray was far more competitive than their meeting in Miami in late March , when Tsonga was extremely poor . He looked to be going through one of his existentialist phases , wondering what the point of it all was .Battle : Murray has dropped two sets so far en route to the fourth round in New YorkMurray , who has slipped to No 9 in the rankings , has pondered the same thing at times , having achieved so much between the Olympics and Wimbledon the following year .Climbing back up the mountain after back surgery must have seemed a forbidding task , but now he has an excellent chance of ridding himself of the statistic that has dogged him since winning Wimbledon that of not having beaten a top 10 player .Tsonga was No 12 when defeated in Florida and , in pure ranking terms , that has been his biggest scalp this season . The Frenchman is now at No 10 , although Murray is dismissive about the significance of that benchmark .Threat : Tsonga has won just twice against Murray in 11 meetings so far in their career' It ' s better almost not to think about it too much because I ' ve played 500 or 600 matches in my career and you ' re going to have moments when certain things are hard , ' he said in the wake of his third round victory .' There are periods when some players struggle to serve out matches , sometimes it can be struggling to come back from tough situations , sometimes it can be struggling to stay ahead or sort of having ups and downs in matches you ' re going to go through that in an 800 , 900 match career . 'Tsonga has said he wished he had thought of hiring Amelie Mauresmo , who will be in Murray ' s corner for what will be a 12th encounter between the two .Murray , whose game can defuse the Frenchman ' s power , usually prevails and he leads their series 9 2 . It is their most important meeting since the Wimbledon semi final of 2012 . 	 0
Distraught and tear stricken roadies have never doubted the existence of the wicked imp that tangles perfectly laid guitar and sound cables when rock bands are touring . It ' s always a disappointment to find your immaculately placed equipment all messed up and untidy .Yet , the Oxbridge Centre for the Promotion of Reason , Progress and Scientific Evidential Enquiry Has Finally Proved that the tangle fairy does not exist .Yes : apparently , the existence of a tangle fairy is implausible in terms of the known laws of biology , physics and psychology of mass delusion .Indeed : no photographs or videos of a tangle fairy have emerged , so we ' re on shaky empirical ground here .In addition , the whole idea of a tangle fairy is not merely unverifiable , but entirely unfalsifiable , and hence utterly irrelevant to any serious scientific discussion .But roadies are outraged :" We all know who this creature is . You put the cables in nice and neat , and when you finally arrive at the gig , they are all tangled . . ." I mean , I hate these poncey scientists talking above us , from their ivory towers and shoddy laboratories . How can they talk down to us like this . I ' ve never met a single roadie who hasn ' t been harmed by this wicked supernatural being . "However , Archbishop Welby is less disparaging :" The Church of England does not currently have a stance on the existence of the tangle fairy . . ." And as we are a broad church , with a plurality of opinions on matters not fully essential to salvation , I can only reiterate that we should not let ourselves become divided over matters which are really not fundamental questions in our faith ." So , let ' s focus on the core issues , first and foremost . "But some of the more fastidious members of the Archbishop ' s flock are not impressed .Indeed , one traditional diehard Anglican warned :" Typical fuzzy wuzzy equivocation from the man on the top . I mean , if we give our enemies an inch , they ' ll take a mile . I ' m wanting to hear some really strong leadership on this issue" You know , secular humanists atheists Darwinists may think that there isn ' t a tangle fairy , but I once saw him with my own eyes when we were having a beer or two and a cheeky smoke , whilst preparing for a Graham Kendrick tribute medley in the Greater Birmingham Post Denominational Megachurch Congregation Centre ." I mean , if we can ' t even agree on these so called minor issues , what chance will there ever possibly be for us to agree on the fundamentals of the historic Christian faith ? " 	 1
WASHINGTON A two year investigation conducted in five major cities has exposed a widespread campaign by the formidable Rest and Fluids industry to infiltrate thousands of doctors ' offices and dictate how they treat minor illnesses .The investigation the full details of which will be disclosed in this newspaper over the coming months documented thousands of instances in which sick patients were repeatedly instructed , often verbatim , to " lie down and drink plenty of liquids . " This treatment , recommended a staggering 4 out of 5 times on average , was in each case prescribed by a physician known to have recently enjoyed a golf vacation courtesy of Big Rest and Fluids ." You have no idea how deep this goes , " said Dr X , a physician who wished to remain anonymous . " They ' ve got everyone , from the pediatricians and family doctors , right on down to the school nurses . We ' ve had the cure for the common cold for nearly 40 years , but it ' s still ' rest and fluids , rest and fluids . ' Why ? Because these guys are getting paid through the nose , that ' s why . "" The complimentary king sized beds , the downy soft comforters , the absolutely ravishing women , " Dr X continued . " It ' s a sick , sick world . "The American Rest and Fluids industry first rose to prominence during the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 , when there existed only meager competition from quarantines and prayer . After gaining influence during the ' 20s and ' 30s , mainly through mob connections and a few corrupt U . S . senators , R F was again buoyed in 1947 following the introduction of employee sick days .What began as a small scale racket has today grown into a multinational organization , with billions of dollars devoted each year to pushing its pro napping , broth focused agenda ." At this point , it may be impossible to unseat the power Rest and Fluids has over the American health system , " patients rights activist Oren Michem said . " With their promises of free La Z Boy chairs and high priced hotel rooms , it ' s no wonder they ' ve cornered the cold market . Sure , they never come out and ask , ' Can Rest and Fluids count on your loyalty ? ' But the intention is obvious . "" It took my son nearly a week to stop sneezing and coughing , " Michem added . " Who ' s to say a regimen of strenuous exercise and fasting wouldn ' t have helped him more ? "To date , no doctors have been willing to testify against these so called Rest and Fluids " fat cats " for fear it would destroy their careers . In fact , a number of physicians have already been blackballed for prescribing echinacea and other over the counter remedies .Worse yet , some fear violent retribution for not toeing the Rest and Fluids line . In 1997 , four Chicago doctors who were known to prescribe cough syrup were found dead at the bottom of a pool of NyQuil . Officially , these deaths were blamed on the less powerful Natural Causes industry , but many still believe the message delivered that day was clear .Representatives of Rest and Fluids have refused to comment on the allegations ." My clients have nothing to say about this or any other litigation involving R F , " said Robert Marconi , one of the industry ' s legion of high paid defense attorneys . " Rest and Fluids has done nothing wrong and will fight these charges for as long as it takes . They can ' t prove a thing ! "With a recent 12 . 3 million donation to several prominent Washington bureaucrats , Rest and Fluids will most likely continue its stranglehold for decades to come . That is , unless one young and energetic nurse practitioner from Louisiana has his say .This newspaper has recently learned that whistle blower Nathan Bellows has collected a mountain of evidence outlining years of blackmail and corruption on the part of R F . Evidence , Bellows said , he plans to leak to 12 major media outlets later this week .Bellows lives at 138 Juniper St . , Apt . 3H , Folsom , LA , 70437 . He goes jogging every morning around the nearby reservoir and is always alone . 	 1

Sure , overall the numbers look OK , as the third place Seahawks logged 113 yards rushing on the day , but a deeper look shows that Wilson was responsible for a whopping 28 percent of those 113 yards . Meanwhile , Lynch and second string back Rawls combined for just 81 rushing yards and zero touchdowns .If the team ' s run game falls flat , Wilson doesn ' t have the talent around him to make the plays with his arm .Wilson praised his offensive line during the postgame press conference . " Guys just really stepped up tonight . They really showed up in a big way against a very , very tough defensive line , and that was really exciting , so their confidence just continues to grow . "Wilson was referencing the fact that the unit allowed no sacks on the night , but the reality of the situation is that the veteran QB was routinely flushed out of the pocket thanks in part to a shoddy O line that has already allowed a ridiculous 31 sacks on the year .In addition , his receiving corps ? outside of Jimmy Graham ? is nothing to get excited about .Relying on Wilson and his athleticism to extend so many drives is dangerous , as it could easily result in an injury for the two time Pro Bowler .Wilson is smart and possesses a rather high football IQ , so he generally doesn ' t run unless it ' s totally necessary . However , a look at the stats tweeted out by the NFL Network earlier on Sunday paints the picture of a ticking time bomb and the possibility for a major injury :Russell Wilson : the most sacked , the most hit , the most knocked down quarterback in the NFL this season . pic . twitter . com hI0LPCMDnAIt ' s not just the possibility of injury that should be of concern to the Seahawks . The fact that they ' re falling behind and then relying on Wilson to make plays with his legs is a concern moving forward as well .Falling behind was never something the Seahawks had to worry about over the last few years , as the team ' s defense generally held teams to so few points that a bailout was never necessary .This year , though , Seattle ' s defense hasn ' t quite lived up to the hype . It is already allowing 2 . 4 more points per game than in 2014 ? and 3 . 9 more points than in 2013 .The Seahawks need Marshawn Lynch to step up and take some of the heat off Russell Wilson .It may be unrealistic to expect the team ' s defense to keep up its historical level of dominance , but it doesn ' t change the fact that additional pressure has been heaped on the offense , which forces it to do something that it doesn ' t do particularly well : score points .This year , the Seahawks rank ninth in the NFC in points per game , averaging just 22 points over their first eight contests .Speaking of offensive struggles , expect those to continue over the next few weeks .Of their next eight games , four will come against teams that rank in the top half of the NFL in total defense ? that includes two games against the Cardinals . Even worse for Seattle is the fact that six of those eight games will come against teams that rank in the top half of the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game .These teams should be able to contain Wilson on the ground . This will force the Seahawks ? who manage just 214 yards per game through the air ? to throw the ball more often , exposing one of their biggest weaknesses on offense .So , all told , when asked how long the Seahawks can rely on Wilson to keep saving them with his legs , the answer is : not long . 	 0

From raping women , to raping young boys , to rape jokes , to rapes resulting in pregnancies , to inflammatory public remarks concerning rape , America simply couldn ' t get its fill of brutal sexual defilement this year . And with unwanted violations still hot on the lips of the nation ' s top lawmakers , rape doesn ' t appear to be going anywhere anytime soon .Athens , GA resident Scott Jorgenson , the Antichrist , had a particularly noteworthy 2012 , purchasing a new condominium in March , finally moving in with his girlfriend , Trish , and remaining intent on provoking the downfall of all humanity . The very incarnation of evil itself , the 32 year old website designer and spawn of Lucifer also earned a sizable raise at work and , in addition to seeking to undo all that is good and pure in the heart of mankind and retiling his master bathroom all by himself , helped his office bowling team to a league title .2012 was a landmark year for the minority or whatever , who made their voices heard like never before and blah , blah , blah . Many minority groups , including African Americans , Hispanics , women , same sex couples , and whoever else took on a more prominent role in the nation ' s political discourse , or something along those lines . They also made great strides for better pay and equal employment opportunities , making the case that they deserve to be treated as valuable members of society and whatever other bullshit they were whining about all year .From Africa and the Middle East to the shopping mall and movie theater right down the road , the assault rifle seemed to be everywhere in 2012 . The international and domestic megastar was simply unable to stay out of headlines this year , as the young , the religiously obsessed , and the mentally unstable couldn ' t get enough of the fully automatic weapon . With the gun ' s popularity only on the rise , 2013 is poised to be an even bigger year for the high powered military grade rifle , so keep an eye out for it .Internet commenter Nick Mayfield , 32 , enjoyed a breakout year in 2012 , posting on such sites as Reddit , Facebook , Twitter , The Huffington Post , and Buzzfeed . Expressing his views on politics , music , movies , celebrities , sports , general pop culture , and the opinions of other Internet commenters , Mayfield initially burst onto the scene in mid February after calling a fellow YouTube user a " fukin faggot " for posting a low resolution trailer for The Avengers .It was another notable year for 68 year old Ronald Trump , the older brother of real estate mogul and multimillionaire Donald Trump .

The game will also use pylon cameras that film the goal lines and sidelines on each side of the field , and they ' re embedded with microphones to enhance what CBS calls the " natural sound of the game " .The network announced the new technology Tuesday at a TV critics gathering in Pasadena .Be proactive Use the " Flag as Inappropriate " link at the upper right corner of each comment to let us know of abusive posts . It provides " an unbelievable ground level view " , said McManus of the cameras , which were deployed Monday night during college football ' s national championship game .

Lavrov : Policy of restraining Russia continues , though high time to drop itRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gives his annual news conference in Moscow , Russia , January 26 , 2016 . ? Maxim Shemetov ReutersThe US and the EU are still pursuing a dangerous policy of restraining Russia , including the NATO military build up near its borders , Russia s foreign minister said , adding that Moscow is ready to cooperate on an equal and mutually beneficial basis .The policy of restraining Russia continues , though it is high time to drop this policy and file it in the historical archives , Sergey Lavrov told a media briefing in Moscow .The Russian foreign minister agreed that relations between Moscow and the west would never be the same again .Our western colleagues say sometimes that there will be no more business as usual with Russia ? and I m confident that statement is absolutely correct , Lavrov said .There will be no more business as usual after they attempted to impose agreements on us respecting the interests of either the European Union or the US in the first place , trying to convince us that they will not damage our interests , he said . That s over now .Moscow is ready for close , constructive cooperation with its western partners , yet solely and only on an equal and mutually beneficial basis , without interference into each other s internal affairs , with respect for the principal interests of each side , Lavrov said .Western countries are still trying to accrue one sided benefits " and even attempting " to punish us for conducting an independent international policy , Lavrov said .Of course , we take that into account in our actions . But that s not our choice .NATO ' s build up near Russia s borders is shortsighted , the Russian foreign minister said , adding that Moscow would keep an eye on the concentration of military potential in neighboring countries ." Now we see the counterproductive and dangerous policy in relations with Russia , including the build up of NATO ' s military potential near our borders and the creation of global European and Asian segments of a global US missile defense , " Lavrov said .He added that Moscow considers such actions destabilizing and shortsighted .We re not interested in the EU getting weaker , leave alone the union splitting up . We are interested in a united and strong European Union , a comfortable partner on the economy and all other issues . But we cannot fail to see the current developments , Russian foreign minister said , emphasizing the decisive role of Germany in maintaining EU s unity .No peace talks to resolve the Syrian crisis can be successful without the Syrian Kurds participating in them , the Russian foreign minister said . Yet the final decision on whether to invite the Kurds remains with the UN ' s Syria envoy , Staffan de Mistura , and Moscow is not going to veto it .We ve been hearing from certain members of the international Syrian support group , I d say from one member , doubts about whether the Syrian Kurds , more specifically the Democratic Union Party PYD , should be invited to the talks . I believe that without that participant the talks will fail to deliver the result we expect , which is a final political settlement in Syria , Lavrov said , pointing out that the Kurds make up to 15 percent of Syria s population and inhabit a considerable , moreover crucial territory . 	 0
The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January .Marwan , whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir , was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah ' s central command .The FBI said in February that a DNA sample understood to be from a severed finger taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan .But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist .The FBI had been offering a 5 million reward for information leading to Marwan ' s capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court .It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the Philippines based Abu Sayyaf .Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012 .The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , the largest rebel group in the region .But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono , in the southern province of Maguindanao .The mission went disastrously awry .Forty four members of the police ' s elite Special Action Force ( SAF ) unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters ( BIFF ) a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government .According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict ( IPAC ) last month , the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS .In the immediate aftermath of the assault , the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire , before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a " blocking force " became engaged in an eight hour firefight with MILF fighters .According to the IPAC report , the SAF " blocking " company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived ,Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died . The clash shattered a three year ceasefire with the MILF , authorities said .A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest .Bowdich expressed the FBI ' s " sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive . "While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines .The IPAC report argued that the " single minded focus " of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress ." The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , " read the report , which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan .The report argued that , although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf , he was not " the master bomber that his reputation suggested . "Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U . S . allies , killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target .The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan ' s who described the Malaysian as " a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

BOSTON , MA A gorilla employed by the Boston Police Department has been placed on administrative leave after he threw feces at homeowner Henry Louis Gates Jr .The 410 pound , 14 year old male known as " Rebel , " who has a sign language vocabulary of more than three hundred words , reportedly became agitated when a member of his troop exerted territorial dominance at the home of Gates , then had his claim called into question .Tearing off his police uniform , the knuckle walker pounded his chest furiously and bared his teeth , screaming as he charged the Harvard professor before stopping short and pelting him with several handfuls of feces ." Rebel " then signed several sentences of " jungle monkey gibberish " before proceeding to trash the department , scattering hundreds of files until subdued by a tranquilizer dart .The behavior raises questions concerning quotas in the department gorillas share nearly 99 of their DNA with humans , so liberal loons in Massachusetts had rallied for years to include the highly intelligent primates on the force .The Boston Police Monkey Patrol Association issued a release stating , " The actions of this gorilla in no way represent the ideals held by other dedicated primates who proudly serve the Department . "" Please , try to understand , " said Police Chief Silverback as he picked a bug out of the hair on his leg , inspecting it closely before finally popping it in his mouth . " We ' re doing the best we can with what we ' ve got . It ' s a jungle out there , folks ." Hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo . . . Hah ! ! Hah ! ! Hah ! ! " he added . " Thbbblbblbbffftth ! !

menasha, wi after seeing the rough cut of his new tv commercial, bob dieber, 46, owner of menasha lanes, told the 30 second spot's creator to make it look " more matrix y, " sources reported tuesday. " yeah, it definitely has the matrix thing going like i wanted, but i can't help feeling like it could have more, " dieber said of the ad, slated to air on appleton green bay upn affiliate wacy 32 during upcoming judge hatchett telecasts. " there needs to be more special effects or something. like maybe a bowling ball flying through the air in slow motion. that'd be a pretty funny twist. " the ad, as scripted, features dieber bowling in a dark trenchcoat similar to the one worn by laurence fishburne's matrix character morpheus. after bowling a strike, dieber turns to the camera, strikes a martial arts pose, and says, " at menasha lanes, you are the one. " though the commercial conveys the low prices, fun family atmosphere, and new bumper bowling one can enjoy at menasha lanes, dieber said it lacks the " dazzling computer y feel " of the matrix and the matrix reloaded. " is there any way we can work in those falling green letters or something? " dieber said. " and i'd love to throw in some of those levitating effects. there could be a shot of me in the snack bar, and i jump into the air and just stay there while the camera spins all around me. that'd grab people's attention. " dieber's suggestions have caused headaches at hot spot films, the local production house shooting the ad. especially frustrated by his efforts to up the matrix ante is director andy schuba. " we pride ourselves on being the commercial production house in the fox river valley area, " schuba said. " we have a state of the art editing suite and a special machine dedicated to titling effects. but the things bob wants to do would run 10 or 20 times over the budget for this project, if we could even do them at all. " in spite of his limited resources, schuba has made every effort to satisfy his client, trying to closely replicate the multiple camera " freeze " shots popularized in the matrix films. with only one handheld hi 8 video camera, schuba attempted to slow down the ball as it approached the pins, then " pan around the other side of the ball quickly. " the effort ended in frustration. " cameraman derek gund was supposed to run around the ball as it was rolling down the lane, but his shots were all too bumpy to use, " schuba said. " on the third or fourth take, he twisted his ankle in one of the gutters and had to take the rest of the week off. normally, i wouldn't even try something like that, but menasha lanes is one of our biggest accounts, and we really want to keep them happy. it's been tough, though. " schuba said that dieber, though well intentioned, does not understand the technical complexities of his ideas. " he's really hands on with his ads, but in the end, he doesn't really know what he's getting into, " schuba said. " he wants full cgi effects, multiple camera stuff, stop action filming. you just can't do that stuff on a 900 budget. " spoofing hit movies is nothing new for dieber : the matrix spot is menasha lanes'fourth movie inspired ad in the last decade. the first was a 1993 terminator 2 inspired ad in which dieber donned a leather jacket and said, " bowl here once... and you'll be back. " " people really got a kick out of that one, " dieber said. " i can't tell you how many people would see me in the street or standing in line at the post office and shout,'hey, terminator!'years later, i still get that every now and again. " in the summer of 1995, the terminator ad was followed by a wayne's world ad, in which dieber, wearing a long black wig and brandishing a guitar, invited viewers to " party on at menasha lanes! " " that was a good one, too, " dieber recalled. " the kids loved it. " in 1999, looking to tap into the austin powers craze, dieber donned a purple paisley sports coat and shouted, " menasha lanes is shag alicious, baby! " the ad, which has run for the past four years on local milwaukee bucks telecasts, will be retired in september when the matrix spot is set to debut. schuba, who collaborated 	 1
Click here to read Martin Samuel ' s full column on Radamel Falcao .' They hate the way you walk , ' begins the latest stupid adidas advert , ' they hate the way you talk . . . ' It ' s Luis Suarez time again , folks . Oh , sure , the rest of the adidas roster is there , Gareth Bale , James Rodriguez , Karim Benzema but by focusing on the hatred top footballers receive , the spiel is plainly inspired by one man .Shamelessly , adidas ' s posters at the World Cup showed Suarez , teeth bared , like a ferocious beast , and tried to make a selling point of his previous poor behaviour .They were hastily taken down when he bit an opponent for the third time in his career , and fans took to posing with the pictures as if putting their heads in a lion ' s mouth . Suarez and adidas were mocked mercilessly , but deservedly .Luis Suarez ( centre ) is no stranger to controversy and has invited fans to ' bring on the hate ' in a new advertSuarez , surrounded by negative headlines , is portrayed as the ' Target Man ' as he poses and smiles hereSuarez was caught up in another moment of infamy when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last summerGareth Bale stars in the advert as the Real Madrid star poses with the words : ' There will be haters '' There will be haters , ' is the latest campaign message . And indeed there will . But not when Suarez ( below ) just plays his football . Last season , on the back of a brilliant and unsullied Premier League season , Suarez ' s fellow professionals made him their player of the year and the football writers did the same . He was universally praised for the performance that knocked England out of the World Cup , too .Then he bit Giorgio Chiellini , got banned , and Uruguay were soundly beaten and eliminated in their next game by Colombia .So , in fact , people don ' t hate the way Suarez walks and they don ' t hate the way he talks . They hate that he keeps biting people . And that adidas tries to sell its football boots off the back of this . They really hate that .adidas are launching their latest set of f50 , predator , nitrocharge and 11pro boots with the advert 	 0
ENCINITAS , CA In a completely inconsequential event that has already captured the imaginations of thousands , amateur sailor Michael Gilmer , 29 , announced Monday he would be embarking on a sea journey around the world to actively decrease awareness of significant global issues .Gilmer ' s expedition , which will cover approximately 28 , 000 nautical miles and bring absolutely no exposure to any urgent environmental or social causes whatsoever , is expected to last roughly 90 days and draw millions of eyes around the world directly away from events of actual , crucial import ." I hope to use my lifelong love of sailing to take part in a completely irrelevant novelty stunt that in no way benefits humanity , " Gilmer said of the non news event that will needlessly cycle in and out of the top spot on news websites for weeks . " The goal here is to really make people think about a young , overconfident asshole on a boat rather than any pressing matters of substance that actually affect people ' s lives . "Added Gilmer , " Even if just one person reads a news article about my pointless ego trip instead of a story about the global financial crisis , then I ' ve done my job . "The utterly irrelevant boat ride , which Gilmer plans to document by video so that people can oc cupy precious hours of their time watching clips of a self satisfied little shit in a cramped sailboat cabin as if it were an actual event of significance , will in no way address climate change , ocean conservation , unemployment , workers ' rights , cancer research , or any wars or conflicts anywhere in the world .Gilmer whose inconsequential personal history thousands of Americans will actively choose to make space for in their long term memories told reporters he has been planning his meaningless and distracting journey for quite some time , citing his own completely self serving narcissism as his sole inspiration ." I saw so many people out there refusing to take time out of their day for bullshit media sideshow events like mine , and I thought , ' Something needs to be done , ' " said Gilmer , whose circumnavigation will actually be covered around the clock by real , paid journalists whose job it is , ostensibly , to bring the most significant issues of the day to the American public . " The fact that I ' m getting this much media attention already is a real blessing for me and literally no one else . "A number of major corporate sponsors whose only concern is to have their names attached to a big news story with lots of coverage have already pledged to donate a dollar for every nautical mile Gilmer sails , with the money going to help offset the cost of his travels rather than toward a charity devoted toward the betterment of the human race .In addition , dozens of major news outlets have already promised they will act astonished and impressed by Gilmer ' s completely unconstructive accomplishment , a landmark that many , many others have previously reached , going back more than a century , and that is in no way worthy of nationwide , let alone worldwide , recognition ." It won ' t be easy of course there are going to be some rough winds and huge waves that I ' m sure you ' ll hear described as though they were the kind of thing that had an effect on the famine currently ravaging Somalia or something , " said the man who with every word he speaks magically decreases the number of words printed on the subject of AIDS in Africa or the potential for democracy in the Middle East . " But whenever things do get hard , I ' ll just remember what I ' m doing this for and take comfort in the fact that the hearts and minds of literally thousands of people are stupidly invested in me . "At press time , something was happening in Washington . 	 1
Why top Republicans are working doggedly to help Bernie SandersDemocratic presidential candidate Sen . Bernie Sanders , I Vt . steps off his bus as he arrives to speak at a town hall , Tuesday , Jan . 19 , 2016 , at Santa Maria Winery in Carroll , Iowa .Some of the most powerful figures in the Republican Party are doing everything they can to help Democratic presidential contender Sen . Bernie Sanders .It ' s been a strange race from the start ? an insult spewing outsider trumps an establishment favorite on one side a Denmark loving socialist mounts a serious challenge on the other ? and during Sunday evening ' s fourth Democratic presidential debate , things got stranger .During the debate , the Republican National Committee sent out four separate e mails defending the Vermont senator against Hillary Clinton on issues ranging from single payer healthcare to guns to Wall Street , as reporters noted across Twitter .The RNC is sending reporters multiple rapid response emails defending Bernie Sanders from Clinton ' s attacks . Very unusual .On Twitter , Sean Spicer , the RNC ' s chief spokesman and strategist , tweeted multiple messages supporting Sanders and his points with the pro Sanders hashtag FeelTheBern .And following the debate , Republican operatives did their best to cast Sanders as the debate winner ." Clinton needed a win last night . Instead , everyone is talking about how well Bernie Sanders , her chief rival , did , Jeff Bechdel , a spokesman with the Republican political action committee America Rising , told reporters .Call it a long running tradition of campaign capers , a sincere understanding of the saying , " The enemy of my enemy is my friend . "For Republican strategists eager to help their chief enemy ' s enemy , strengthening Sanders now will weaken Mrs Clinton in the general election . At least , that ' s the theory . ?My guess is that Republican operatives know that Clinton is likely to win the nomination even if Sanders upsets her in Iowa and New Hampshire . But an extended challenge will force her to use up money too early , and nudge her farther to the left , ? Jack Pitney , a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California , told Bloomberg News . A t this stage , campaigns will grab for every advantage they can get .In fact , all the way back in June 2015 , the conservative National Review ran a piece urging readers to " Support Bernie Sanders ! This is a call to action for every Republican anxious to win back the White House in 2016 . "" Republicans have a pre primary opportunity to strengthen Bernie Sanders s financial position so that he will have ample resources to dog Clinton and turn her into a raging leftist during the primary season , " Myra Adams , a conservative writer and former Bush and McCain staffer , wrote for the Review . ?In fact , Sanders is competitive in both Iowa , which hosts the country ' s first caucus , and New Hampshire , which hosts the country ' s first primary . Sanders wins in those states could seriously injure Clinton ' s national lead .And some Republicans are already salivating at the prospect of a Sanders nomination .We ' re going to win every state , Ohio Gov . John Kasich said in last week ' s Republican debate , if Bernie Sanders is the nominee ." Wild , socialistic , liberal Bernie Sanders " would be " easy to beat , " RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said recently on the " John Gibson Show . "Of course , it ' s hardly the first time partisans on either side have worked subtly , or not so subtly , to choose their opponent .In 2012 , Democratic Sen . Claire McCaskill worked diligently to boost Republican Rep . Todd Akin in his primary race so that she could face ? and beat ? him in the Missouri Senate race general election . She did , and won by more than 15 points .But perhaps the most salient example comes from 2008 , when Rush Limbaugh waged a campaign , " Operation Chaos , " encouraging millions of his supporters to " bloody up Obama " and prolong the Democratic primary fight by supporting ? you guessed it ? Hillary Clinton . 	 0
ITHACA , NY In a stunning medical breakthrough , a team of Cornell University biogeneticists announced Tuesday that it has developed a revolutionary new synthetic hormone that retards the human aging process , enabling individuals to extend the churning , meaningless void known as life by upwards of 20 years ." This remarkable new hormone will enable millions of people to live longer , healthier lives , " said Dr Marlene Peretz Worthington , head of the Cornell team . " Once the substance wins FDA approval and is made available to the general public , ish emptiness of our spiritually blank lives should be that much more inescapable . "According to Peretz Worthington , between 1990 and 1998 , 250 test subjects between the ages of 68 and 81 were injected bi weekly with Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase , an experimental DNA modifying hormone that " freezes " the genetic codes that regulate aging . In all 250 subjects , the drug slowed down the aging process by at least 30 percent , adding years to their futile , purposeless existences .In addition to retarding aging , Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase has proven effective in fighting disease . Experts cited the example of Gus Dermott , a Charlotte , NC , dockworker whose nightmarishly empty life of grueling menial labor nearly ended when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig ' s Disease . When administered high doses of the hormone over a seven month period , Dermott showed such rapid improvement that doctors now estimate he will be able to return to his soul crushing , spiritually hollow toil within as little as three months ." I was bedridden , just waiting to die , " Dermott told reporters . " But now , they tell me I can go back to that same dock where I ' ve already wasted almost 20 years of my life , and waste the rest of it while waiting to die there instead . "Gertrude Anne Klingbell , an 89 year old Alzheimer ' s Disease sufferer from Shaker Heights , OH , had equally miraculous results using the hormone ." I used to be blissfully unaware of my pathetic , pitiable state , " said Klingbell , whose Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase treatments have restored her mental faculties . " Now , the doctors say I can live on without any purpose whatsoever for years , trapped helplessly within the bleak prison of shattered dreams and blasted hopes that has been my life . "According to Cornell ' s Dr Sunil Gupta , Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase also has applications in treating cancer ." The cancer patients who participated in our study expressed a deep sense of hopelessness and despair , not only over the disease , but the horrifying awareness of the random injustice of the world that contracting the disease instilled in them , " Gupta said . " Now , that sense of misery in the face of an uncaring universe can be stretched out over many years of grueling family crisis , despair , painful chemotherapy and surgery , instead of mere months . "Despite its early successes , Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase has yet to be proven effective in fighting some life threatening diseases , diseases which still may offer us eternal respite from the screaming vortex of unending blankness that defines the human condition . But as medical science continues its pointless fight to indefinitely prolong the existential void of modern life , the revolutionary new hormone represents the most promising development in years ." Thanks to Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase , the wasteland just got a little bigger , " said American Medical Association executive director Dr Gordon Puhl . " We ' re all very excited about the new drug and its potential to imprison patients even if only for a few more desperate , agonizing years in lives they can make no sense of , see no point in , and find no worthwhile purpose for . As we slowly learn to accept that our pretensions to relevance and meaning are but so many fragile , illusory constructs which crumble like sandcastles in the face of the universe ' s utter indifference to our plight , one thing is certain : Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase and other such medical advances will ensure that , for each of us , young and old alike , terminally or mildly ill , our suffering is far from over .

After years of investigation , Scientists at Dyson ' s Research and Development labs in Sussex have isolated the single greatest cause of obesity in the western world ." It ' s the toaster , " said Geoff Fry , head of the Single Slice Toaster Development Team , or SSTDT . " The toaster is making people fat . "According to the research since the invention of the two slice toaster in 1978 , America has been getting fatter , with other western countries quickly catching up ." America buys more toasters and makes more toast , " said Fry . " They ' ll even make waffles in them , and the problems are all the same . "Apparently , because toasters ( " And waffle irons , " said Fry ) heat up two slots , people believe it would be a waste of electricity to just make one slice of toast ( " or waffle ! " said Fry ) ." Who can resist a hot slice of buttered toast ? " asked Fry . " Except for the lactose intolerant . And when that ' s doubled , which makes sense given the fact that there is another slot there , just heating up for no good reason , unless it has bread in it . "Fry has postulated with conclusive mathematical proofs that two slices of hot buttered toast ( " Or waffle . . . " said Fry ) is twice the calories of a single slice of hot buttered toast . . . or waffle ( " Thank you , " said Fry ) . Twice the calories is twice the weight gain . Also , twice the toast , is twice the cost , thus pushing up the cost of living . Anything that could solve this conundrum would be a boon to the world ' s waistline and economy ." Fortunately , " said Fry . " We at Dyson ' s toaster research facility have come up with the perfect solution . "Going on sale in the next couple of months is the Dyson Single Slice Toaster ." This also does waffles , " said Fry . " It looks like a standard four slice toaster . And indeed it can toast four slices , but instead of two elements heating up , it only heats up those slots with toast in . "This will halve electricity bills and reduce waistlines across the gluttonous western world .For those that cannot afford a Dyson Single Slice Toaster , give the other piece of toast to a friend . 	 1
( DENVER ) Last Thursday , fans of the hit Fox TV show American Idol watched as Bobby Bennett crooned his grand finale after America ' s verdict . He was supposedly voted off the show after viewers across the continent watched his Wednesday night performance . Three others were also evicted during Thursday ' s episode , where performances from Tuesday and Wednesday were briefly highlighted .An anonymous source within the American Idol compound in Los Angeles has now leaked that Bennett was not " voted off " like the other three the results were tampered with by producers after Bennett failed to produce anything controversial in his past or present that could be used to hype the show in the coming weeks ." We don ' t always use the fireworks , " said Anna , not her real name . " Usually , we use it at the beginning to start everything off with a bang , but we ' ll also air it during the middle when the ratings start to sag . The so called Brittenum controversy proved to be such a real winner for us , and so we kept the ball rolling this week by spreading the news about the provocative layout Becky O ' Donohue did with her twin sister , Jessie . That was absolute genius ! Our website was nearly floored by the traffic seeking out anything and everything they could about Becky . We were going to run on that for another week or two , but the Extra TV show aired it a day late , and poor Becky got evicted . By Monday , she ' ll be forgotten , so it was Bobby ' s turn under the microscope . We needed something on him to leak , and frankly , there just wasn ' t a darn thing ! "Bobby Bennett , back home today in Denver , not only confirmed the story , he faxed to us a transcript of a meeting he secretly recorded when producers confronted him about not keeping his end of the bargain . " They were really pushing for me to be gay , or something along those lines . ( A producer ) kept asking me about that , and even asked if I had ever been an escort , or ever used the services of one ! I kept telling them I hadn ' t , and that it wouldn ' t be such a good idea anyway , considering the controversy poor Clay Aiken is suffering from right now , and that ' s when they hit me with the clincher . They said there was no way I would win the competition , and being controversial was the only way I could provide entertainment so , that made it okay . "Our calls to Fox went unanswered , except for a call from their attorney threatening legal action if we mentioned any Idol producer , or employee by name , or released any transcripts or other materials to back up our allegations .So , we asked Bobby a few questions ourselves :" You ' re not gay , bisexual , or have any peculiar sexual habits ? "" No , " Bobby replied ." You ' ve never posed nude or half nude for any publication ? "" I was in the summer edition of Mountain Music Bazaar , but I was fully clothed . "" You ' ve never committed any crime . . . "" Heck , no ! " Bobby interrupted us ." No identity theft , no assault and battery . . . "" No ! "" No shoplifting . . . "" Never . "" Traffic violations ? "" Well , I did get a ticket last year . . . "I encouraged him to continue ." Well , I was parallel parking at the County Court House , and I accidently left my rear left fender five inches outside the parking zone . "" What were you doing at the Court House ? " we asked , thinking we still might have a story ." Registering to vote . "So , there you have it , America . Bobby Bennett was thrown off the show for being . . . boring . 	 1
LANDOVER , Md . A look at Washington Redskins players who were " up " and those who were " down " in a 35 18 playoff loss to the Green Bay Packers :TE Jordan Reed : He showed once again why he s considered one of the best receiving tight ends in the NFL . How he didn t end up in the Pro Bowl remains a mystery . But Reed makes athletic plays and once again shook defenders , beating them to areas they were trying to take away . He finished with nine catches for 120 yards and a touchdown and remains a crucial building block .P Tress Way : His success early in the game gave the Redskins a chance to compete . He pinned Green Bay inside the 13 yard line twice in the first half and three times for the game . Way averaged 50 . 6 yards per punt with a net of 44 . 6 .RB Alfred Morris : This might have been his last game as a Redskin . It s not as if he had some dominant game , but he looked pretty good when he did run the ball , finishing with 50 yards on 11 carries . Again , it wasn t a great game but it was solid and perhaps this is a nod to a guy who had a strong tenure in Washington .Run defense : The Packers , and quarterback Aaron Rodgers in particular , did an excellent job of preventing the Redskins from substituting . That , in turn , made a difference in the run defense . The Redskins allowed 141 yards on the ground they could not afford to let the Packers have success in both the run and pass game . They failed on this account .Pass rush : The Redskins could not generate any sort of pressure after some early success . Credit Rogers for quick throws , but he also had enough time on passes that took longer . The Redskins could not take advantage of Green Bay s weakened offensive line .WR DeSean Jackson : Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Jackson needed to run more aggressively to the end zone on the touchdown that turned out to not be one . Jackson also opted not to extend the ball , perhaps fearing it could be poked away . But after that catch he only had one more reception for three yards . The Packers did a good job taking him away , but he needed to be more of a factor . 	 0
The police officer who shot an unarmed teenager in Ferguson two weeks ago learned his trade on a force that was disbanded over racial tensions , it has emerged .Darren Wilson shot black teenager Michael Brown dead on 9 August , sparking weeks of protests and charges that the town ' s police force is racist .Now the Washington Post reports that Wilson ' s first job as a police officer was with a nearby force in the city of Jennings that was scrapped over racial tensions following a series of controversial incidents .Inauspicious : Darren Wilson received a special commendation for his services with the Ferguson police in February but had his beginnings in the town of Jennings where the entire police force was dismissed in 2011In one , a Jennings officer fired his gun at a mother fleeing in her car with a child in the back seat .In another , an officer beat a woman on her own front porch .The city council concluded that the force had been discredited with the local population and dismissed every officer .An incomplete picture of Texas born Ferguson officer Darren Wilson has emerged since the shooting , when authorities say the white six year police veteran killed Michael Brown during a confrontation in the predominantly black city where all but three of the 53 police officers are white .The Brown family ' s attorneys have labeled Wilson as a murderer , though the investigation continues and no charges have been filed . The 28 year old officer has gone underground since the shooting , with relatives refusing to reveal his whereabouts or discuss the shooting or Wilson ' s background .But snippets of his life have emerged . Court records show Wilson divorced last November .His parents were married only four years before divorcing in 1989 in Texas .His mother Tonya Durso , also known as Tonya Harris , went on to marry twice more and died at the age of 35 when Wilson was just 16 .Online court records show that she pleaded guilty in 2001 to a dozen felony stealing and forgery counts in Missouri ' s St . Charles County just west of St . Louis and was sentenced to five years on probation , with the judge suspending a five year prison sentence .After her death , Wilson was placed under the guardianship of Durso ' s second husband Tyler Harris until a St . Charles County judge dissolved that in mid 2004 .Young life lost : Darren Wilson shot an unarmed Michael Brown , 18 , six times , resulting in his deathWitnesses say Brown was walking in the middle of the street with a friend before being stopped by Wilson , who moments later shot the teenager dead , 	 0
NEW YORK Three hours after placing Al Gore in the " dead " column , NBC News retracted its projection Tuesday , changing the vice president ' s status to " too close to call . "" I ' m sorry , but it now appears that we reported Mr Gore ' s death prematurely , " NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw announced on air at approximately 2 : 15 a . m . EST . " The latest readings show his red blood count down to 3 . 1 . At this point , it could go either way . "Gore , shot Monday by a Republican sniper during a foray into the Bush controlled territory of New Hampshire , has been clinging to life in a hospital just across the Vermont border .According to NBC News correspondent Tim Russert , nurses and anesthesiologists leaving the operating room at various points during a 14 hour operation on Gore were exit polled regarding his chances of survival ." When several sources reported a direct hit to the spinal cord , everyone thought it was all over , " Russert said . " It turns out that report was erroneous . The shot missed the spinal cord by a hair ' s width . "Early in the evening , NBC ' s on screen outline of Gore was colored blue , signifying life . At 11 : 17 p . m . EST , it turned red , indicating death . When word arrived that Gore had a pulse but no signs of brain activity , the outline reverted to its original uncolored state , meaning " unconfirmed . "In the hours following the erroneous report , NBC was more cautious about making projections , posting the latest readings from Gore ' s blood pressure monitor but refraining from speculating about his overall status .Democratic Party chairman Ed Rendell expressed anger over what he called NBC ' s " shoddy , irresponsible journalism . "" Who knows how this could affect how Gore is perceived when he attempts to gather military support in disputed states ? " Rendell said . " NBC should know better than to call the outcome of an operation before the body is even closed . "NBC was not alone in prematurely calling Gore ' s death . CBS , ABC , and CNN all made the same mistake ." In our efforts to bring Americans the most up to the minute news on the war for the White House , we made some hasty decisions , " CBS anchor Dan Rather said . " I ' d like to apologize to all of our viewers , as well as to the entire Gore junta . " 	 1

rough seas are delaying the connection of the vessel helix producer to the ruptured oil well in the gulf of mexico, a spokesman at the oil cleanup command center in louisiana said wednesday. the linkup " may be in place by saturday, " he said. officials have said that the hookup is partially completed despite the bad weather, but once it is done it could draw up to 53, 000 barrels of oil a day. but charles gaiennie of the unified command's joint information center in houma, louisiana, says the current " sea state " is delaying the operation and that many louisiana cleanup activities, such as skimming and flights delivering aerial dispersants, have been " stood down " because of the rough weather. he said that if there's is " a window of opportunity to deploy resources, we will do so. " newly retired coast guard adm. thad allen told reporters wednesday it will be 24 to 48 hours before the sea calms enough to finish the linkup. allen also told reporters that relief wells must be drilled an estimated 200 to 225 feet farther before they intercept the leaking well bore. he said that officials still expect that the relief wells will not be completed until august. on wednesday, the advocacy group " alliance for justice " released a report on oil industry ties among 5th circuit judges. the report comes ahead of oral arguments set to begin thursday in hornbeck offshore services v. salazar, the case that challenged the obama administration's six month ban on deep water drilling. ajr's 9 page report claims that many appellate court judges have extensive ties to the oil industry, including jerry edwin smith, william eugene davis and james l. dennis, the three judges who will hear the administration's appeal of the drilling moratorium. the group also says district judge martin feldman, who issued the order prohibiting the drilling moratorium, has financial interests in oil drilling companies. oral arguments for hornbeck v. salazar will begin thursday afternoon at the u. s. court of appeals in new orleans. meanwhile, louisiana gov. bobby jindall joined navy secretary ray mabus and u. s. sen. mary landrieu on a flyover of affected areas, including the barrier islands, port fouchan, grand isle and the mississippi river. the tour lasted about 90 minutes. and in mississippi, state authorities report that they've received eight of the nine skimmers produced in france. officials have closed more beaches in hancock county and continue to press cleanup efforts. officials say 550 bags amounting to 8, 250 pounds of oil related debris have been cleaned from a mile long stretch of beach in waveland. federal estimates say between 35, 000 and 60, 000 barrels ( about 1. 5 million to 2. 5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the gulf daily since april 22, when the deepwater horizon sank two days after an explosion aboard the drilling rig. " the intention is to intercept the well bore, well down below the surface near the reservoir, then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up, " allen said. " that will allow them to basically plug or kill the well. once that's done, you could do things like remove the blowout preventer, bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened. " also, a massive airship, or blimp, and a sea vessel that can suck oil out of the ruptured well are expected to arrive in the gulf region at the end of the week to aid in oil disaster response efforts. their arrival is being delayed because of rough weather, said stephanie hebert, spokeswoman for the cleanup effort. the u. s. navy airship will be used to detect oil, direct skimming ships and look for wildlife that may be threatened by oil, the coast guard says. it had been scheduled to reach the gulf on tuesday. the 178 foot long blimp, known as the mz 3a, can carry a crew of up to 10. it will fly slowly over the region to track where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore. the navy says the advantage of the blimp over current helicopter surveillance operations is that it can stay aloft longer, with lower fuel costs, and can survey a wider area. the coast guard has already been pinpointing traveling pools of oil from the sky. " the aircraft get on top of the oil. they can identify what type of oil it is and they can vector in the skimmer vessels right to the spot, " coast guard capt. brian kelley said. but the problem since june 30 has been the ability to clean it up before it approaches land. bad weather has made that task more difficult. fears over the spill now extend all the way to florida's atlantic shores. small tar balls continued to wash ashore wednesday at cocoa beach, just south of cape canaveral. the u. s. coast 	 0
Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker says he feels no pressure to run for president at 47 because a certain political rival of his is toying with the idea well into her 60s .Walker , who was recently re elected for a second term , says he believes that the closer you get to running for president , the more you realize how crazy you have to be to actually do it ." The closer you get to something like that the more you realize and I say this only half jokingly that you have to be crazy to want to be president , " he said . " And anyone who has seen pictures of this president or any of the former presidents can see the before and after . No matter how fit , no matter how young they are , they age pretty rapidly . "Noting the toll a presidency takes on one ' s health , Walker opened up about his bald spot becoming an issue on the campaign trail ." One of the frustrations for my campaign staff is they felt for whatever reason my opponent largely faced little or no scrutiny about anything , so it was an interesting contrast when I talked about the bald spot on the back of my head , which has admittedly grown beyond just being the focal point of a story or two , " Scott said . " It was just one of those things where you raise your eyebrows and say , ' really ? ' But , you know , it is what it is . "But despite his national presence and ongoing speculation about a 2016 presidential run , Walker says that he still feels compelled to serve out his term as governor ." The only thing I think someone . . . should run for president not because they want to be or yearn to be , but because they feel called to , " he said . " Right now , I still feel called to be the governor of the state of Wisconsin , and I ' m going to do the best job I can over the next four years . "This is not the first time the potential 2016 candidate has taken a dig at Clinton ' s age . Shortly after the latest midterm elections , Walker told Fox News that Clinton , who recently turned 67 , embodies " old " politics ." I think the biggest loser ( in the midterms ) was Hillary Clinton , " Walker said . " She embodies Washington . She embodies that old , tired top down approach from the government . I think in the states as governors , we offer a much better alternative , and I think there ' s a number of us who would be good prospects out there . " 	 0
CHICAGO American Trans Air Flight 282 from Chicago Midway to Newark took a turn for the tedious Monday , when undercover air marshal Kirk Gillam was drawn into a conversation about passenger Terrence Delsman ' s patio for the majority of the two hour flight ." Most people just take whatever tiling option their contractor gives them , " Delsman told Gillam . " But I did research online and opted for terracotta . I couldn ' t be happier . "Gillam is one of an estimated 4 , 000 marshals placed in the cabins of U . S . commercial airlines by Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge in an effort to tighten aviation security .Gillam , a former Navy SEAL , trained for 12 weeks last year in tactical terrorist suppression aboard an aircraft . Delsman , who was traveling to Newark on business , single handedly spruced up his backyard in July .The flight long discussion about patios was prompted by an umbrella advertisement in a SkyMall catalog sitting open on Gillam ' s lap ." That ' s close to what I have in my yard , " Delsman said . " But mine was a lot cheaper . A lot cheaper . I know this great place in Elmhurst that sells top brand stuff . You should check it out if you ' re ever doing some remodeling . "Delsman also told Gillam about the difficulties he had getting his patio furniture delivered , the quality of his outdoor barbecue set , and the benefits of citronella candles over tiki lamps ." The lamps just don ' t work as well as the candles , " said Delsman , unaware of the 9mm automatic hidden inside Gillam ' s coat pocket . " The candles smell better , too . "" Uh huh , " Gillam said . " Those come in the metal buckets , right ? "Gillam , who knows 18 different ways to disarm a knife wielding adversary , nodded rhythmically as Delsman related the simple pleasure of lounging in his newly finished patio ." Sure , it was hard work , but it was worth it , " Delsman said . " Sitting out there in the summer with a drink in my hand , watching the sun go down . . . Sometimes I ' ll invite the neighbors over . "In an interview Tuesday , Gillam said he has learned to remain focused on his mission preventing hijack attempts and ensuring the safety of airplane passengers and flight crew even when he ' s involved in casual conversations ." I ' m not allowed to bring a book on board , and I certainly can ' t sleep , so talkative passengers tend to target me , " Gillam said . " I ' m on anywhere between two to four flights a day . Usually , people just talk about their kids or jobs , but this week , I ' ve heard about everything from working at Disneyland to breeding Wheaten Terriers . It ' s really not that bad . Although I am kind of tired of talking about how many airlines don ' t serve dinner anymore . "Continued Gillam : " I do a visual scan of the entire cabin every five minutes while we ' re in flight , to see if anything is brewing , but the people talking to me don ' t seem to notice . "When asked his opinion of the U . S . government ' s decision to order foreign airlines to place armed air marshals on some international flights , Gillam seemed indifferent ." I guess that would be fine , " Gillam said . " It ' s part of my job to be flexible . I ' m not much of a talker , though . I can usually get through these short trips , but an eight hour flight to Ireland beside a Chatty Cathy might be more than I could handle . I should ask if I ' m allowed to wear headphones as long as I have the sound turned off . "Ridge praised the air marshals for helping to keep the nation ' s skies safe ." The marshals are to be highly commended , " Ridge said . " Despite being forced into excruciatingly mundane conversations about everything from stock portfolios to the proper way to make a pork roast , these men remain vigilant .

When I was studying economics , " said Osborne , " on a night course in Northwich three weeks ago , I discovered this theory that the length of women ' s skirts correlates exactly to the state of the economy . "According to the theory Osborne has seen , when the economy is booming , women wear mini skirts , and when the economy is in downturn the skirts get longer and longer ." I think the whole thing got messed up when women decided to start wearing trousers all the time , " said Osborne , with a touch of lament in his voice . " The economy didn ' t know how to handle that . "Osborne believes that if women all start wearing mini skirts again , then the economy will pick up in time for the next election ." For the sake of the British people ! " cried Osborne , " Girls hitch up those skirts ! Tartan ! Flared ! Pleated ! Or Pencil ! Almost show your knickers ! But don ' t , we ' re called the Conservative Party for a reason . All our parties are conservative affairs with sparkling water not champagne and cocoa with absolutely no cocaine . "Women of the UK are being urged to wear mini skirts even when it ' s cold wet and miserable , " for the sake of the economy " .Poppy Delevingne , model and almost royalty , has worn a mini skirt for most of her adult life ." I like the mini skirt because my legs are so long and skinny , " she gushed . " I like the way they make me look when I ' ve just had a pedicure and fake bake smoothed all over them during a sensual massage , all creamy and smooth . "However , she didn ' t believe that Osborne was on the right lines . " I think Osborn needs to realise that skirt length is at best optimistic dressing by women during opulent economic times and at worst a false syllogism with no correlation . In either case , the length of women ' s skirts will have zero impact on the state of the British economy and should he wish to see a marked improvement , he should give the job of running it to somebody who understands economics .

Nobody knows heartbreak like Mac Buck , editor of App World ! At least , as far as he is concerned , nobody has ." My heart has been broken so often , " said Buck , " that it has come to resemble a second hand jigsaw puzzle : a million pieces not all from the same puzzle no picture and several important pieces missing . First there was losing my wife , then the researcher on App World ! Daphne , spurned me . Well , I say spurned . It was more that I never asked . "There have been cases of death by broken heart , but generally , it ' s not fatal , or the teenage years would be the final years . But whether young or old , one problem remains : how to mend a broken heart . Step into the breach French applelet company , Le App ." They say time mends a broken heart , " said Buck . " And every iPhone already has the time on it . I can state categorically that the time on an iPhone did not mend my broken heart . What Le App have done is speak to love psychologists at the Parisian Institute for Love , the foremost institute for investigating love in the city of love . "The psychologists , or in French , le psychologists , have discovered that the destruction of photographs of loved ones plus other memories aids the healing process , speeding it up by a factor of ten ." The typical heartbreak lasts one twelfth of the length of the relationship , " said French love psychologist , Dave Handy . " So it takes a year to get over a twelve year relationship and a month for one that lasts a year . By destroying all of the pictures and memories , this can be speeded up , so getting over a year long relationship can take less than a week . "The app makes it look like photos are going up in flames or being shredded or both . It allows memories to be likewise destroyed ." The good thing about this app , " said Buck . " Is that I can take a photo of the Valentine ' s Day teddy I bought for Fraze and mine ' s first date and then shoot it with lasers and flame throwers before dunking it in acid and shredding the remains . "But does it work ?" You know what ? " said Buck . " It damn well worked . I feel really good . " 	 1

Yet again the once sleepy village of Little Divot finds itself at the centre of a national scandal after improper use of a rich tea biscuit was discovered at a local tea room .Staff at the Blue Rinse Tea Rooms were left aghast after one of them caught a man dunking a rich tea into his cup of poncey coffee rather than the traditional dunking in tea scenario .The man at the centre of it all , Duncan Busquets of Trollope Lane , has since become the target of a vicious hate campaign thought to have been started by village biscuit officianado ' s . He has regularly found packets of smashed up biscuits on his front step ever since the incident as some sort of warning .The incident was spotted by eagle eyed staff member Vera Swingbucket . She explained what she had seen . " Well , I saw that the man had ordered a poncey coffee and some rich teas , which was a bit odd to start with . I just laughed it off really . Next thing I knew he ' d got this crazed look in his eyes and started to dunk the rich tea in his coffee . I tried to stop him but he was too quick for me . I had to go and have a lie down out the back on some baps to calm my nerves . The man is clearly a brute , no two ways about it . If it wasn ' t for the fact that our customers are so old they can hardly move , he would of started a riot . Hanging is too good for him . "Dangerous Dunker Duncan as he ' s now known locally claims it ' s all a big fuss over nothing . After wiping some crumbs away from the corner of his mouth , he told us . " So I dunked a rich tea in my coffee . Big bloody deal . There ' s no warning sign saying ' Dunking rich tea biscuits in coffee is prohibited ' . Come to think of it , it ' s a bleeding tea room . What are they doing serving coffee anyway ? They should have a look in the mirror before having a pop at me . As far as I ' m concerned it ' s a storm in a coffee cup . Ha ! See what I did there ? "President of the Little Divot biscuit society , Jamie Dodger , doesn ' t see the funny side of it . He told us , " It may not be illegal but it breaks with tradition and conformity . Frankly , I ' m shaken beyond comprehension at this horrific news . It ' s yet another example of everything that ' s wrong with this country . It ' s bad enough seeing poncey coffee being served in the village , but someone having the brass neck to do what he did , well , it takes the biscuit . He ' s the sort of uncouth , culturally ignorant moron who probably thinks a Jaffa cake is really a biscuit . I ' m outraged . Absolutely outraged . "The rich tea biscuit is said to be recovering well after its ordeal . Biscuit doctors reckon he ' ll be ready to be dunked in a cup of tea early next week . 	 1
at the close of 2012's skyfall, the big fiftieth anniversary installment of the james bond film series, we'd come to the natural conclusion of a de facto " becoming bond " trilogy for current 007 daniel craig. beginning with the 2006 reboot casino royale, and continuing through 2008's quantum of solace, we'd seen bond's first mission, his first true love, his first betrayal, and learned of the childhood trauma that shaped him into the international man of mystery that we all know and love. with a newly introduced, newly youthified q ( ben whishaw ), a brand new miss moneypenny ( naomie harris ), and ralph fiennes as a freshly installed m to give bond his marching orders, it sure looked like the pump was primed for the kind of traditional heightened reality 007 escapades that audiences had been thrilling to right up to the beginning of craig's tenure. but not quite. with spectre, number 24 in the infinitely enduring franchise ( and at 150 minutes this one really is an exercise in infinite endurance ), there's yet more origin to unfurl. continuing the craig era trend of each sequel picking up on continuity and plot points from the previous one, spectre ( again directed by sam mendes, marking the first time a director has done back to back bonds since john glen's record five consecutive entries during the'80s ) finds our man in mexico, tracking down and eliminating some terrorists before their plan to inflict mass casualties can be carried out. following this crackerjack pre credit sequence, we learn that bond was actually carrying out the final wishes of the previous m ( judi dench, who exited last time ). to that end, bond follows the terrorism breadcrumbs and ends up in rome, learning that a whole host of seemingly disparate terrorist acts are all the work of one organization, the ominously named spectre. now, longtime fans of these flicks and their particular iconography will immediately recognize that name as belonging to a group that bedeviled 007 for the most of the earlier films ( identified by the very first bond villain, 1962's dr no, as the special executive for counter terrorism, revenge, and extortion ). when the question of who created spectre ( whether bond author ian fleming or his one time collaborator kevin mcclory ) presented a legal roadblock, the organization quietly disappeared from the films. the last time they had a substantial effect on the action was in 1971's diamonds are forever. mind you, that was seventeen movies and forty four years ago, so clearly the series managed just fine without them. if anything, the concept of spectre was well and truly ruined when austin powers used it as the basis for mike myers'comical dr evil. for the new, rebooted spectre, they've dispensed with the acronym, but kept the cloak and dagger methodology. the organization's enigmatic leader oberhauser is played by christoph waltz, whose true identity probably won't come as a surprise to anyone following the series for awhile, but since the creatives are intent on doing the j. j. abrams " mystery box " thing a la star trek into darkness, i won't reveal that here. waltz is an interesting choice, though he comes off more spritely than sinister, and an attempt to give his character depth by tying him into bond's backstory mostly falls flat due to our unfamiliarity with both the character and the backstory. now, skyfall did something similar as well, but there was a deftness to its touch that helped make this rather glaring contradiction seem less pronounced. what spectre attempts is to tie together several plot threads that we didn't even know had been left dangling in each entry since casino royale, and make it feel like the filmmakers have been building up to some grand reveal. unfortunately, that reveal doesn't really hang together as well as it could, and kind of falls apart in the execution ( as does the forced romance between bond and lea seydoux's dr madeleine swann, which i guarantee will elicit unprompted guffaws ). spectre isn't the worst bond movie, nor is it the best. it's a little too long, a little too indulgent, and a little too scattered to be top tier 007, but it nonetheless? benefits from solid action sequences and the sizable reservoir of audience goodwill for this franchise. in his fourth go round as ian fleming's immortal creation, daniel craig lacks none of the charm and physicality that's made him the best actor to assume the role since sean connery. however, with some question as to whether craig will be back for a fifth go, i'm starting to wonder if we could end up with a situation where an actor comes and goes from 	 0
NEW YORK Following years of speculation regarding the paternity of her 25 year old son Ronan Farrow , who was born in 1987 during her relationship with Woody Allen , actress Mia Farrow admitted in an interview with Vanity Fair this week that her son could have actually been fathered by Frank Sinatra , Mario Puzo , George McGovern , Robert Altman , Anthony Perkins , Milton Berle , Robert Redford , Michael Caine , Danny Aiello , or Bruce Dern , or possibly even Francis Ford Coppola , John Cassavetes , Tony Curtis , Dustin Hoffman , Quincy Jones , Sydney Pollack , Joe Mantegna , Liam Neeson , John Irvin , Bob Balaban , or William Hurt . "Even though we were only married for a few years , Frank was the love of my life , and the truth is I never really split up with him , or , for that matter , Dudley Moore , Kurt Russell , Walter Cronkite , Richard Gere , Gore Vidal , Oliver Stone , Bob Costas , Burt Bacharach , or Prince , " the 68 year old actress and humanitarian told reporters , noting that while she was seriously involved with Allen from 1980 until 1992 , she still " had never really forgotten " former flames Henry Rollins , John Malkovich , Michael Dukakis , Huey Lewis , Paul Newman , and Bill Laimbeer . "But then , of course , about a year before Ronan was born , I had also recently reconnected with ' Pistol ' Pete Maravich , Mikhail Gorbachev , Michael Landon , David Lynch , Jim Henson , Prince Charles , O .J .Simpson , Bruce Hornsby , Fred Rogers , Ted Turner , George Peppard , Jeffrey Dahmer , Phil Collins , Grandmaster Flash , David Duke , Gordon Lightfoot , and Greg Louganis , whom I realized I ' d never really gotten over .So they ' re possibilities as well . "Family sources also reported that Ronan Farrow has spent Father ' s Day the past three years with song parodist " Weird Al " Yankovic . 	 1

After it was reported that Brett Favre sent a text message to Green Bay Packers GM Ted Thompson saying he wanted to come out of retirement , this reporter has learned that it was all a ploy to get a suicidal John Madden down from a 45th story window ledge in downtown Chicago ." John has been distraught and despondent ever since Brett announced his retirement . He stopped drinking and he stopped eating . . . well , he stopped drinking , " said a source close to the legendary coach and NFL analyst . " When it because clear to him that his muse and inspiration may not ever play again , he decided to end it all . "After Madden who was in Chicago as the keynote speaker at the Brotherhood of the International Buffalo Wings Lovers convention decided to end it all , police called Favre ." Brett was great , " according to Stan Nuncrop , spokesman for the Chicago P . D . " We gave Mr Madden the phone while he was on the ledge and the two talked for some time . I heard Favre tell John that he ' d just text messaged the Packers GM and said he planned to come out of retirement . Madden came in immediately . "Afterward , Madden looked down at the street below and told officers that he was glad he didn ' t jump , and used a telestrator to show the police how he would have gone " Boom ! Thwap ! " on the pavement .Mental health workers who are monitoring Madden have yet to tell the football legend that it was all a ruse to coax him off the ledge and that Favre isn ' t coming out of retirement ." When he ' s told , it ' ll be on the ground floor , and we ' ll also make sure all cutlery is removed from the Madden Cruiser " according to a source close to the family . 	 1
SANTA FE , NM Author Jessica Kingley expressed regret Monday that she had " pretty much used up all the hardship " from her early life in her recent first novel Bitter Root , leaving her nothing to write about for her follow up book ." In writing Bitter Root , I drew heavily on my experiences growing up poor and neglected by my alcoholic parents in an economically depressed small town in southern Oklahoma , " the 36 year old Kingley said . " Apparently , I drew a little too heavily , because I don ' t have any personal trials and tribulations left for the next one . "Bitter Root , the fictional story of a young woman named Jessie Strong growing up in the desolation of an economically depressed small town in southern Oklahoma , was heralded by The Chicago Sun Times as " a searing , painfully honest portrait of a young girl ' s hardscrabble adolescence on the plains . "The success of Bitter Root , which climbed to 16 on the New York Times bestseller list , netted Kingley a second book deal with Viking Press worth a reported 450 , 000 . Kingley said the prospect of writing a follow up seems daunting ." I ' ve already used the time my dad , in a drunken rage , burned down the house , " Kingley said . " I used the time my grandmother died and everyone in my family missed the funeral . I used the stuff about the summer the river dried up . I even used that corrupt police officer my cousin dated , even though I only met him once . I just don ' t have any more memories with that kind of dramatic heft . "During her painful years growing up in Oklahoma , " where oppressive heat bears down on chained dogs longing to run run ! and never look back , " Kingley experienced a number of other hardships firsthand . At 16 , she ran away from home the night her father threatened her with a gun . At 18 , she fell into a string of unhealthy relationships that led to a near fatal bout with bulimia . At 19 , she underwent the physically and emotionally wrenching experience of having an abortion .Unfortunately , the protagonist of Bitter Root underwent every last one of these tragedies , as well ." Jessie is a troubled spirit , " Kingley said . " She ' s the type of person who ' s too strong willed to listen to others . She ' s a woman who has to make her own way in this world . So , what happens after she survives her traumatic childhood and , at 20 , finally leaves Oklahoma behind to create a new life for herself in New Mexico ? A bunch of stuff way too boring to write about . "Kingley has already taken several unsuccessful stabs at a second novel . First , she tried writing about a young woman facing adversity growing up on the Louisiana Bayou . Discovering she knew little about Bayou culture , Kingley changed the setting of the book to an economically depressed town in Appalachia , but ultimately found she had a hard time identifying with the characters she created ." After those false starts , I thought maybe I needed to branch out and try something totally different , " Kingley said . " I started a sci fi novel about a young woman and the hardships she faces growing up in a uranium mining colony on a sparsely populated planet in the Andromeda Galaxy . It didn ' t really pan out . "Kingley also attempted , without luck , to find inspiration in her more recent struggles ." I thought I could get at least a short story out of the time my car broke down last year , " Kingley said . " The opening paragraphs about the smoking , stalled car sitting on the shoulder of the highway were pretty good , but it kind of lost momentum when I got to the part about being approved for a loan and picking out a Saturn with my friend from grad school . "The experience of trying to finish " Curls Of Smoke On A Highway " made Kingley realize her recent life may not be suitable for novelization ." Pretty much everything after 1990 is a wash , " Kingley said . " That ' s when I landed my writing residency at the University of New Mexico . After that came my book deal . Then I got married , and my husband and I bought a house . So , right now , my only hope is giving birth to an autistic child . I ' ll keep my fingers crossed . " 	 1
CAMBRIDGE , MA According to a promising new economic report published Wednesday by the National Bureau of Economic Research , a steadily growing number of Americans have become delusional enough to open their own businesses .The report , which described its findings as " highly encouraging for near term economic growth , " confirmed that over 200 , 000 small businesses were founded in 2013 by entrepreneurial Americans who have completely and utterly lost their grip on reality , and noted that the number of bold and frankly insane Americans applying for new business permits had risen markedly over the past year ." The recession of 2008 devastated small businesses throughout the country , but thankfully , recent data have shown a sizable increase in the percentage of Americans who have completely fooled themselves into believing that starting an independently run business is not only a viable option , but one that actually makes sense in the current economic climate , " said James Hemley , an economist at MIT and lead author of the report . " Every day , we ' re seeing more entrepreneurs who are deluded to such a degree that they are confidently investing their entire life savings in new and unquestionably ill fated restaurants , storefronts , and online businesses . "" What ' s remarkable is that these completely deranged people have such an ill placed faith in the long term stability of the small business landscape that they ' re somehow optimistic about their financial future , " Hemley continued . " And that utter detachment from the real world is great news for the economy . "Hemley explained to reporters that in spite of the litany of clear indications that the global economy remained highly unsettled and hazardous , a bright new wave of Americans are currently forging ahead under the fundamentally flawed and entirely irrational belief that their new businesses will attract wealthy investors and establish a loyal consumer base . The promising trend has also reportedly led thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs to conclude that securing large bank loans at high interest rates which will almost certainly lead to insolvency and personal financial ruin is a good idea ." The most encouraging sign we ' re seeing is that many new entrepreneurs are living in such a far fetched , dreamlike stupor that they ' re actually making significant investments in infrastructure and payroll , " Hemley said . " These entirely nonsensical investments will certainly have a positive impact on the job market , as these new ventures create thousands of new jobs for several months until these doomed companies can no longer keep their doors open and inevitably collapse into bankruptcy . "According to the encouraging report , 67 percent of self identified new entrepreneurs are deranged to such an extent that they ' ve convinced themselves the U . S . economy has rebounded to the point that a small business can not only turn a profit , but thrive and eventually expand . The study also found that 78 percent are so severely demented that they believed a tiny , independently run business could compete with the far larger and more powerful national corporate hierarchy .Furthermore , the report confirmed that nine in 10 new entrepreneurs had bought into such an illusory fantasy world that they genuinely believed opening a small business would ensure a steady paycheck , a comfortable life for their families , and a good education for their children , rather than accepting the future of devastation and hardship that certainly awaited them within the next 18 months once their businesses were gone and they were left with nothing ." According to our projections , the number of totally senseless entrepreneurs will only continue to grow over the next several quarters , and as they invest more and more money money that they will never , ever get back into their businesses , their local economies will benefit , " Hemley said . " It just goes to show that in spite of everything even the most basic and plainly apparent common sense the great American entrepreneurial spirit will never die . "" As long as these people continue to be out of their goddamn minds , our economic future appears bright , " Hemley added . 	 1
KARACHI , Pakistan The president of the Pakistani Olympic team Kandarbad Peshabdu is extremely upset with the International Olympic Committee .President Peshabdu has just received a text message from the IOC informing him that the entire Pakistani team will have to retake their urine tests , as the specimen bottles were all lost in transit .FedPax was hired by the IOC to handle the shipping of the urine specimen samples .A FedPax representative Wallace Tallytuckle , 51 , sent out a shipment tracer notice and it appears that somehow the entire Pakistani urine specimen sample shipment , instead of being shipped to London , somehow ended up in the Argentinian seacoast town of Salsa Caliente .Mr Tallytuckle , stated that a local shepherd named Milos Cilantro , Jr . , actually signed for the box . When he was asked what he did with the contents of the box he said that he threw it all in the dumpster since it was filled with little bitty bottles of piss .And so now the entire Pakistani team has to redo their urine tests .President Peshabdu stated that he is extremely furious at the fact that the IOC is conducting much more extensive background checks on the Pakistani athletes as compared to any of the athletes from the other 204 participating nations .A spokesperson for the IOC identified as Reginald P . Boffingwood has informed President Peshabdu that the Pakistani athletes are not being singled out .He pointed out that everyone knows that Pakistan is Taliban and Al Qaeda territory so they certainly cannot be to careful .He stated in no uncertain terms that the last thing we need is for a terrorist pretending to be a Pakistani shot putter to toss a bomb disguised as a shot put into the stands .Sports Balls Illustrated Daily will keep you abreast of any Summer Olympic developments as they develop . 	 1

DUBLIN , OH Representatives for the restaurant chain Wendy ' s announced Tuesday that due to the item ' s continually dismal performance , the company would be discontinuing the widely disliked hamburger sandwich .The hamburger sandwich , which Wendy ' s sources described as a ground beef " patty " placed between vegetables and two slices of bread , has long been the restaurant ' s worst selling menu item , leading executives to decide that the time had finally come to phase it out of all 6 , 650 Wendy ' s locations ." For more than 40 years , we ' ve tried in vain to get the hamburger sandwich to catch on with our customers , but it is now clear that we ' re never going to make that happen , " Wendy ' s CEO Roland Smith told reporters . " We knew from the beginning that the hamburger sandwich wasn ' t going to be for everyone , but we still hoped in vain that it might develop a nice little niche following over time . Unfortunately , it never did . "" After millions of dollars and countless man hours , we have arrived at a very simple truth , " Smith added . " People just flat out don ' t like hamburger sandwiches . "Originally devised as an alternative to classic Wendy ' s favorites like the cucumber tea sandwich or the watercress and beet salad with a light vinaigrette , the hamburger sandwich has languished on the restaurant ' s menu for decades , due largely , officials claimed , to an unwillingness among customers to order something outside their comfort zone .While the company has experimented with variations on the hamburger sandwich over the years , Wendy ' s representatives said such efforts have all been met with quizzical reactions and sometimes even outright revulsion from customers ." Honestly , we tried everything , " Wendy ' s research and development head Charles Cullen said . " We tried including free packets of our tomato catsup sauce , but people said the sauce was too sweet . Then we tried putting some cheese on top of the patty , but people didn ' t like how the cheese melted on the meat . We even tried stacking two hamburger sandwiches on top of each other , but of course everyone hated that because it just meant having to eat more hamburger sandwich . "" There ' s just something about the combination of flavors in a hamburger sandwich that naturally turns people off , " Cullen added .Company sources also announced that they would be phasing out their unpopular French fried potatoes , which were added to the menu in an ill fated , and some said bizarre , attempt to find a pairing for the hamburger sandwich a combination deemed " thoroughly unappetizing " by 95 percent of Wendy ' s customers in a recent survey .The side item will reportedly be replaced by the restaurant ' s beloved fresh celery sticks in all combo meal deals .Though Wendy ' s has sunk nearly 150 million dollars into the hamburger sandwich project since 1969 , Smith maintained that Wendy ' s would remain financially solvent ." Every company tries new ideas , and every company has successes and failures , " Smith said . " Back in 1991 , when we added windows to our restaurants where you could pick up your food in your car , we heard our customer ' s complaints loud and clear : ' Cars are for driving and food is for eating . Don ' t try to mix the two . ' And so we stopped . This whole hamburger sandwich debacle will be no different . "Wendy ' s , of course , is only the latest in a series of fast food restaurant chains to fail on a large scale with the hamburger sandwich : Similar botched attempts have been made by McDonald ' s , Carl ' s Jr . , Jack in the Box , and the short lived all hamburger sandwich concept restaurant Burger King , which opened and closed its doors within eight months in 1994 .Many industry analysts are saying that continued failure to introduce new products into an already established restaurant chain can have dire financial consequences ." We ' ve seen many companies in the past nearly bankrupt themselves with these kinds of ideas , " food industry analyst Norm Horwitz said . " Look at KFC with their disastrous bucket full of breaded and fried chicken campaign . Or Dairy Queen with their cup full of ice cream and cookies . Perfect examples of why restaurants should stick to what they know . "" In my opinion , they ' d all be better off if they stopped trying to think outside the box and just gave people what they wanted already , " Horwitz continued . " Something simple like a nice bowl of zucchini goulash with a side of quinoa , and maybe an omega 3 fish oil supplement for the ride home . " 	 1
Washington D . C . Next month , after a grueling schedule of signing executive orders , President Obama and his family will take a two week vacation to the dilapidated ruins of Martha ' s Vineyard , Mass . , for some much needed rest .The president ' s pen and phone will be flown in by the Air Force One helicopter and separately from the family and the presidential dog .In recent weeks , President Obama has been complaining of carpal tunnel type symptoms and doctors think it is due to his constant overuse of his executive authority , stemming from his belief that he rules the country by decree .During the two week vacation , the president will receive daily hand and wrist massages , water therapy , and electrical stimulation to the nerves in his overworked hands .Mr Obama already suffers from arthritis in his middle finger on both hands from constantly flipping off Republicans and the American people .Doctors commented to us that every other part of the president ' s body seems to be well rested and in good shape . His writing hand appears to be the only part of his anatomy that is being overused at this time .Staff have worked up mock executive orders for the president to sign as part of his rehabilitative therapy . Their hope is that he will be strong enough to continue bypassing Congress after some down time .While the president works hard to strengthen the tendons in his pen and phone hand , the First Lady will spend her time shoving carrots , tomatoes and arugula down the throats of locals .The first daughters will catch some fun in the sun and enjoy spending taxpayer money on souvenirs and other useless junk .When FLOTUS was asked how she reconciled the first family going on a lavish vacation while the poor languished at the border , the First Lady responded , " Let them eat cake !

FOXBORO , Massachcusetts It is no secret that the New England Patriots organization has been quite embarrassed at the off the field antics of tight end Rob Gronkowski .An inside source spoke with Rufus Reno of Sports Balls Illustrated Daily and said that Mr Gronkowski is threading on very thin ice .The player is the highest paid tight end in the history of the NFL and yet he acts like a bigger and taller version of Justin Bieber .Many loyal Patriots fans are starting to question Gronkowski ' s worn out story about him being tired .As one New England fan put it , " Well hell , I would be tired too if I stayed out partying till 3 and 4 in the morning . "Gronkowski just signed a six year contract that will pay him an amazing 9 million per year .And yet the 24 year old continues with his childish antics such as cavorting with porn stars , cheerleaders , and pole dancers .One of his fellow teammates , who did not want his name mentioned , quipped that a lot of the NFL players are commenting that Rob is the male version of Lindsay Lohan .Reports are that there are lots of strippers in the Boston area who perform dressed as number 87 .Word coming out of the Patriots front office is that they are fed up with his Paris Hilton like prima donna antics and if he does not tone down his partying ways , he may find himself on the trading block .A Gillette Stadium beer vendor said that he overheard Gronkowski talking on his cell phone and he said that he is the greatest player in the history of the Patriots team .SIDENOTE : Rob Gronkowski justifies his immature antics by saying that at least he isn ' t even in the same league as his former teammate Aaron Hernandez who is now wearing prison orange instead of Patriots red , white , and blue . 	 1
Relocating sports teams should pay back public funds , McCaskill saysSen . Claire McCaskill , D Mo . testifies before a subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Dec . 9 , 2014 . The subcommittee hearing focused campus sexual assault cases . ( AP Photo Lauren Victoria Burke )' We were not prepared for the cruel attack and false claims made by our local team owner , ' task force writes in letter to NFL . Read moreST . LOUIS ? Sen . Claire McCaskill , exasperated by the imminent relocation of the St . Louis Rams , has begun drafting a bill to claw back public dollars from professional sports teams that prematurely leave their hometowns .McCaskill , a Democrat , said Sen . Roy Blunt has expressed interest in cosponsoring the bill .Blunt , the state s Republican senator , could not immediately be reached for comment . He told reporters earlier in the day that not every problem is a federal problem . Still , he said he was certainly open to talking about other ideas .McCaskill has been pressuring the National Football League over the past year to keep the Rams in St . Louis . She spoke with Commissioner Roger Goodell the night before Tuesday ' s NFL owners vote ." St . Louis stepped up , in good faith , " she told the Post Dispatch on Wednesday . She called plans to spend 400 million in local and state tax dollars on a 1 . 1 billion St . Louis riverfront stadium a " massive " public investment , and the region s second , following construction of the Edward Jones Dome itself .? Consensus among regional leaders : St . Louis is done with professional footballBut the NFL instead approved Rams owner Stan Kroenke ' s request to move the Rams back to Los Angeles ." I ' m confident at this point that the NFL used excuses to turn down our stadium project , " she said ." There ' s no question in my mind that , years ago , Stan Kroenke made up his mind he was going to L . A . "He worked methodically , and , at some points " maniacally , " to get there , she said . Kroenke ' s relocation proposal to the league , which called St . Louis a " struggling " city , incapable of supporting three professional sports teams , " purposely burned the bridge with St . Louis , " she continued . He knew it would infuriate St . Louis fans ." The notion that we can ' t support an NFL team is laughable , " McCaskill said , " just laughable . "She called the NFL ' s process a " very smelly onion , " and the years spent planning the new St . Louis stadium a waste ." It appears to me this was a useless exercise , " she said .Senators have a history in demanding accountability from the NFL . When the Bidwill family was threatening to move the St . Louis Cardinals football team to Phoenix , for instance , Missouri Senators Jack Danforth and Thomas Eagleton pushed a bill to mandate league relocation procedures . The bill made it out of committee , but before it could get a vote on the floor , the NFL adopted its own set of relocation guidelines , using very similar language , McCaskill noted .Her office is in the early stages of drafting legislation . Staffers said the goal is to make sure communities are treated fairly if a sports team that benefits from public funds ? such as playing in a publicly financed stadium ? decides to move to another community .McCaskill said she s not being vindictive . " I have a chance to make sure no other community will get treated like St . Louis , " she said . " The heart of the NFL isn ' t just in the mega media markets . "Others are already examining more exactly how Kroenke won NFL approval to leave Missouri , she said . " There ' s a lot of things we have to take a look at , " she said .McCaskill hinted that regional leaders may be considering a suit against the NFL . If the NFL didn t comply with its own relocation guidelines , her staff later clarified , it is possible anti trust laws were violated .If so , McCaskill said , " I think that ' s a real problem for the NFL , legally . "A new team in St . Louis , of course , would ease the sting , McCaskill said .There is some hope , she suggested , that the Oakland Raiders might move to St . Louis . Owner Mark Davis has said several times he s looking elsewhere .The quirky owner stopped briefly to talk to the Post Dispatch on Wednesday morning in Houston , site of Tuesday s owners meeting . He confirmed he was interested in other cities .Chuck Raasch of the Post Dispatch contributed to this report .Copyright 2016 stltoday . com . All rights reserved .

The most important decision Mitt Romney has made in his campaign so far , the selection of Wisconsin Rep . Paul Ryan for his running mate , tells us two things and neither bears good news for the middle class .First , Romney has fully and unequivocally embraced the extreme Ryan budget plan . Earlier this year , he called it " marvelous " now he ' s made it his own . The Romney Ryan plan would throw seniors under the bus and undermine their health security by ending Medicare as we know it . It would increase health care costs for seniors , including those on fixed income , by thousands of dollars a year .The extreme plan proposed by this year ' s Republican ticket would bring huge tax breaks to millionaires , paid for by tax hikes on the middle class , and massive cuts to investments that strengthen the middle class priorities like education , health care , energy and scientific and medical research . Whether you are a college student trying to pay for school , a veteran worried about your health benefits , or a senior worried about retirement security , the Romney Ryan plan is bad news . It would have devastating real world effects on people young and old across the country .By the numbers : Paul RyanRomney and Ryan have put ideology ahead of what ' s right . They refuse to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans under any circumstance not another dime , ever . Unlike the Bowles Simpson deficit reduction plan or the president ' s balanced plan to reduce the deficit that include asking everyone to pay their fair share , the Romney Ryan budget would reduce the deficit on the backs of seniors and the middle class .Even the U . S . Conference of Bishops admonished the Romney Ryan plan . So did a group of nuns who recently traveled by bus across the country with the message that our budget is not just our country ' s fiscal map , it is our moral one . They rightly pointed out that , as it says in Corinthians , " If one part suffers , every part suffers with it , if one part is honored , every part rejoices with it . "On the political front , Ryan ' s selection is yet another sign that Romney is running to the far right and is the most extreme conservative candidate we have had in generations . The embrace of an ideologue like Paul Ryan may appeal to the Republican Party ' s Tea Party base , but it will completely alienate independent voters , especially in battleground states .Opinion : Paul Ryan and Gen X GOPSeniors in Ohio and Florida have every reason to worry what a Romney Ryan administration would do to them when Medicare is handed over to private insurance companies and Social Security is subject to the whims of Wall Street . Voters should also consider that , even as our nation faces threats of terrorism and remains at war , for the first time in modern presidential history the Republican ticket lacks any national security credentials . It ' s no coincidence , then , that its views on national security are dangerous and ill considered .Any voter wondering about our leaders ' values should consider what they do in the room when the tough decisions are on the table . While President Obama was in the Oval Office , making the toughest calls any president has had to make how to save the economy from depression , rescue the American auto industry , bring affordable health care to millions of Americans or take out Osama bin Laden Paul Ryan was in a different room .How Romney campaign kept Ryan tap under wrapsHe was sitting side by side with fellow House Republican ideologues John Boehner and Eric Cantor as they risked the full faith and credit of the United States , regardless of what it would mean for the middle class , jobs and women ' s rights .If there ever was a question about what this election is about , today ' s announcement answers it . Throughout this campaign , Mitt Romney has lacked a clear vision . Now he ' s embraced a radical ideologue with a dangerous one . This election is absolutely a choice between two visions for our country ' s future . Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have solidified their roles as rubber stamps for the reckless and failed economic theories of the past .The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile . 	 0

A group of Republican senators rushed to Washington in the middle of the night to pass emergency legislation to force a retrial in the recently concluded Michael Jackson child molestation case ." We have reason to believe that the jury made a terrible mistake in this case , " said John Cornyn ( R TX ) . " This new piece of legislation seeks to remedy that mistake . "" I question the jury ' s verdict in the Michael Jackson case , " Tennessee senator Bill Frist said in a press conference Thursday . " I question it based on a review of the Entertainment Tonight video reenactments of the trial I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office . "The Michael Jackson Act of 2005 declares that , " All individuals in California who are named Michael Jackson and are on trial for child molestation must , until the end of the year , be required to undergo two criminal trials to determine his guilt . " No other individuals were listed in the Act .Rick Santorum ( R PA ) added , " Whenever we have a legal dispute involving kids , as we clearly had in this trial , we will err on the side of children , the most precious members of our society . "In a press release , Michael Jackson , a 46 year old musician who experienced some mild popularity in the early 1980s , called the legislation " ignorant . "Some Democratic senators criticized the legislation , including Illinois Sen . Dick Durbin ." This Michael Jackson Act ' is straight out of Nazi Germany . Josef Stalin and his pals would have signed this in a heartbeat . It is , by a very wide margin , the most fascist piece of legislation signed in the history of the universe , " Durbin said on the senate floor . " Move over Pol Pot , we have a new dictator in town , and his name is the GOP . "Former presidential candidate John Kerry ( D MA ) also directed some criticism towards the legislation , saying that the Michael Jackson Act " will , in all likelihood , be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court . Never before has the Senate passed legislation that affects only one person , because that ' s not how we work . And it is because of those reasons that I applaud the passage of it . "The new trial is expected to begin next Monday . 	 1
BURBANK One of the main stars of the Disney Channel , Selena Gomez was suddenly taken ill and rushed to the hospital .Gomez , aka Justin Bieber ' s girlfriend had just made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno when she suddenly told her personal assistant that she was feeling dizzy , kind of like when she hears Sarah Palin going on and on about something that President Obama did or did not do .She was quickly given a bottle of water and told to lie down in Jay Leno ' s office . Leno started to leave his office telling Selena ' s assistant , Mindy Grillbrewster , that he did not want to be the cause of any rumors about him and Selena that would get back to Justin .The assistant giggled and told him that he was old enough to be her father and then she changed it to grandfather .Leno , who does not have much of a sense of humor , told Grillbrewster to help Selena get up and put all of her clothes back on and help her out of his office .He said that he had already arranged for his wife Mavis to drive her to the hospital in his 1938 Hispano Suiza DuBonnet .Gomez was quickly admitted into Our Lady of The Silver Screen Hospital . She did not have to go through the standard 13 page admission forms procedure since everyone in Los Angeles knows Mrs Jay Leno .Selena was immediately carried by two hospital orderlies up to her room on the 13th floor .Gomez asked one of the older female nurses if she could be placed on another floor since she was superstitious of the number 13 .The nurse identified as Tularosa " Shotsy " Gettysburg put down her chart , arranged her name tag since it was upside down , and informed Gomez that this was Our Lady of The Silver Screen Hospital in Los Angeles and not The Whole Enchilada Hotel Spa in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico .Just then Nurse Gettysburg realized that her patient was the Selena Gomez of Disney Channel fame . She asked her if she could have her autograph . Gomez softly smiled and told her to go to eBay and buy one on line .As Selena waited for the doctor to show up and check her out , Mindy asked her if she had any idea as to what her mystery ailment could possibly be .Selena smiled . She put down her copy of NBA Weekly and confided to Mindy that her mystery ailment was brought on by the fact that she missed her boyfriend JustinGomez said that the same thing had happened once before when he had returned to Canada to help his mom paint her bedroom .Selena said that one of the symptoms of her ailment is that her tonsils swell up and actually touch each other making it hard for her to eat pizza , burgers , pitas , or barbacoa tacos .She said that once Justin shows up and touches her the tonsil swelling will go down immediately and she will be fine .Bedroom Pillow Talk is reporting that Selena Gomez informed them that the nation ' s ' First Kiddoes ' Malia and Sasha Obama have agreed to appear on Selena ' s Disney show ' The Wizards of Waverly Place . ' She noted that they have agreed to donate their appearance fee to The 2011 White House Christmas Party Fund . 	 1

The White House on Wednesday dismissed an Iranian threat to deploy warships near the U . S . coast , and military experts said Iran lacks the naval capability to do so .Overnight Tuesday , Iranian state news quoted a commander as saying his country plans to have a " powerful presence " near the U . S . border .In response , White House spokesman Jay Carney said that " we don ' t take these statements seriously , given that they do not reflect at all Iran ' s naval capabilities . "Pentagon spokesman George Little echoed Carney ' s point , saying Iran has the right to send vessels into international waters , but " whether they can truly project naval power beyond the region is another question . "" I wouldn ' t read too much into what came out of Iran today , " Little said , adding : " I think what is said and what is actually done can be two different things . "State run Press TV in Iran said similar plans were announced in July . However , no Iranian warships ever deployed . In February , two Iranian navy vessels traversed the Suez Canal in the first such voyage by Iranian ships since 1979 .Richard Herrmann , director of the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University , said Iran ' s navy is too small with too miniscule a budget to remain for long off the U . S . coast ." This is hard to take seriously , because Iran ' s navy is very small . This force , whatever it may be , is going to be puny , especially compared to the U . S . Navy , " said Herrmann , who specializes in the use of imagery and posturing in international conflicts . " Iran doesn ' t have the capability to come within close proximity to ( the United States ) to conduct hostile activities . Even if ( Iran ) launched missiles , we would sink their ships immediately . "Iran lacks battleships or aircraft carriers . Its forces are capable of patrolling the Persian Gulf and sailing a short distance in the Indian Ocean , Herrmann said , but keeping ships stationed near the United States , so far from Iran , would be too expensive for the government ." They would need a place to resupply , refuel , restock crews with food and water . They couldn ' t afford that unless they got help , " Herrmann said . " I would imagine they could get help from somewhere in South America , maybe Venezuela . "Venezuela and Iran are allied by their anti U . S . sentiments .Michael Connell , the director of the Iranian studies program at CNA , a Washington area think tank that specializes in naval analyses , agreed with Herrmann ." Their navy can ' t reach our coastline right now , " Connell said , describing the Iranian announcement as " bombastic rhetoric . "" It ' s posturing " by Iran intended for both its domestic and regional audience , Connell said . Making such pronouncements projects a dominant role including naval power , whether or not they can back it up , he added ." The Iranians have been historically annoyed that we have a naval presence in the Persian Gulf , which is kind of their backyard , " Connell said .The worst move the United States could make now would be to overreact , said John Mueller , the Woody Hayes chair of national security studies at Mershon ." Hopefully this won ' t play into ( American ) neo cons who are itching for a war with Iran , " he said . " The best thing to do is ignore it and treat it with the contempt it deserves . If Iran wants to waste their time and money on a dwindling supply of fuel ( to keep ships ) bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean , then let them . "The idea of Iran moving ships near the U . S . coast is not on par with the Soviet Union flying planes off the coast of Alaska during the Cold War , Mueller noted . The Soviets ' move was legal , and was considered a gesture intended to irritate the United States , he said ." Those were different circumstances and different players , " Mueller added .Herrmann cautioned that while moving ships near the U . S . coast may not be a real threat , Iran is certainly capable of harming the United States but closer to Iran .Iran could attack U . S . ships in the Strait of Hormuz , a waterway between the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf , on the south coast of Iran . Such attacks could disrupt oil markets and scare American tourists , Herrmann said . 	 0
Dan Quinn understands the struggle for sought after coaches in playoffsAtlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn discusses job hunting during NFL playoffsFalcons head coach Dan Quinn spoke with SI ' s Don Banks on what it s like to be a head coaching candidate during the NFL playoffs . Quinn began interviewing for coaching positions last season while he was with the Super Bowl bound Seahawks .Last year at this time , as the ? Seahawks geared up to make their second consecutive Super Bowl run , Dan Quinn went into self imposed blackout mode , cutting himself off from the temptation to let the NFL s frenetic hiring season morph into an all consuming obsession . After all , the Seahawks defensive coordinator knew his January job hunt ? and he was perhaps the most prized head coaching candidate on the market , interviewing with five different teams ? could not become his primary occupation .So with the biggest job interviews of his life lined up , Quinn undertook that delicate dance that postseason bound head coaching candidates have to execute , attempting to stay fully in the present while weighty matters that determine their futures play out . And the more Seattle won in the playoffs , the more Quinn was forced to play the waiting game , due to the league rule that prohibits any team from hiring a coach whose team is still active in the Super Bowl tournament .? NFL coaching tracker : Breaking down all of the Black Monday movesIt s a tricky and nerve wracking balancing act that can make coaches feel as if they re working without a net .It totally tested me , in a real cool way of having the mindfulness to make sure to be right where you re at , instead of into the future , says Quinn on Thursday , days after completing his first season as the ? Falcons head coach , a job he accepted two days after Seattle s Super Bowl loss to New England last February . It was like the greatest challenge , but one that pushed me to know I could do that if I had to .At least if he kept his proverbial blinders on and stayed away from technology for long stretches of time .I know I had to do some tricks for my own self to help me stay on point , Quinn says . I interviewed with the first club the Tuesday night after the regular season ended , and I made a decision that night that I m not going to look at the internet again until I m done with our season . So it went from ( Dec . 30 ) until after the Super Bowl that I didn t look at the internet . I just didn t want to know the speculation or where the story was with any of it . And there were some days I left my phone in the console of my car . I didn t want to see it .Quinn feels as if he was one of the lucky ones , in that the vast majority of the head coaching interviews he sat for during the past two postseasons came during the bye week that Seattle earned as the NFC s No . 1 seed in the playoffs , a vantage point the Seahawks used to reach those back to back Super Bowls . He met with the Vikings and Browns in early 2014 , and had a chock full dance card in talking with the Jets , Bills , Bears , 49ers and Falcons last year .This season , that January juggling act might attempted by popular candidates like Carolina defensive coordinator Sean McDermott , New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels ? or Cincinnati offensive coordinator Hue Jackson , all of whom work for highly seeded playoff clubs . The Panthers and Patriots have first round byes , but the Bengals do not , and Jackson is scheduled to interview with the Browns , 49ers and Dolphins on Sunday in Cincinnati , just hours after the Bengals play host to Pittsburgh in a first round playoff game Saturday night .Having the bye made all the difference for me , Quinn said . Had it not been for those byes , I don t know if I would have handled it in the same way or been able to go through the process in the same way . I didn t have the mental challenge to say , Oh , I should be looking at this opponent or this thing , because we didn t even know who we were playing yet that first weekend . It got harder the longer the process went , but the first interviews were a really cool experience to meet owners and general manager and share your philosophy with people around the league . I met guys like Ron Wolf and Ernie Accorsi , who were helping advise some of the searches , and I thought that part was awesome .In trying to mesh the present with the future in terms of his time and his job demands , Quinn said another key was the early prep work that he did in putting together his written presentation for the interviews , as well as working on the assembly of a potential coaching staff . He carved out the only time he could for those phone calls . 	 0
Bob Bipschwitz was buried this morning . Bob was a bottler back before machines did the jobs of men .Bob had a knack for keeping things in bottles , things like soda bubbles , bobbles , beads and bows . Bob loved to bottle . It was his calling . When he was eleven ' Big Bobby Bip ' as he was known to his friend , bottled bees and beetles . Even then he was a master . Friend Freida Freud said , " He sure does like to put things in bottles . "Bob never had any formal training , just a rash of empty beer bottles due his fathers prolific hobby . Big Bob senior was a master drinker . He was unaware of his sons penchant for bottling , as he spent most of his evening passed out under the families porch . This was fine with Bob . The more bottles the better .As Bob grew up he tried to showcase his talents , but no one really understood him . Mostly people just yelled at him as he walked about town with two belts loaded up with a bunch of beer bottles . He would bottle anything left alone for a minute or two . Such was his skill , and so fast was his trade that most folks didn ' t even see him at work ." That little nutter wearing a brace of belts loaded with beer bottles , just bottled up my car keys and about two dollars and fifty cents in loose change ! What ' s wrong with him ! "Never leave anything lying idle when Bob was on the scene . Not unless you wanted it sealed in a beautiful brown thick bottomed bottle . So when he sought employment at the bottle company he was a perfect fit .He walked in and bottled up the bosses wallet faster than you can scream " What in tarnations are you doing boy ! " Yes , once the boss laid his eyes on Bobs skill and his speed , he though . " This kid will work weekend for next to no pay . " He was hired that day and worked straight through till morning , then he put in just one extra shift . Bob was content and came eagerly to work everyday of the week , and of course he brought is own tools .Bob Bipschwitz bottled at Bette Bottle Barn for 30 odd years before automation blew his bottle capping days away . Where does a lifetime bottle stuffing Bob go after that ? No one else really had use for his skill . So after months of looking , Bob Bipschwitz did the only thing he could think of . He bottled himself .The neighbors found him in his backyard , smiling contentedly sealed in the biggest bottle they had ever seen ." He seemed very happy . I mean , he sure did like to bottle stuff , it just seemed fitting . Given his skill he should be well preserved for a number of decades . "So Bob Bipschwitz was buried this morning , bottle and all , like some sort of strange time capsule to the boy who never really adapted to a world who couldn ' t use him . Sealed up for eternity , a happy Bob floated off to that great bottling plant in the sky . 	 1
US Democratic nomination : Hillary Clinton backs Barack Obama ' s record in response to Bernie Sanders surgeThe former Secretary of State is neck and neck with the ? Vermont Senator ? in Iowa and New Hampshire , the first two states to decide who to nominate for the White HouseDemocratic presidential candidates , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders on stage for the NBC News debate in South Carolina at the weekend AFPHillary Clinton has been forced to change tack and aggressively embrace the record of President Barack Obama in response to the increasingly successful campaign by her self proclaimed Democrat Socialist rival , Senator Bernie Sanders . ?Her move follows signs that Mr Sanders threatens what her campaign hoped would be straightforward wins in Iowa and New Hampshire , the first two states to decide who to nominate for the White House .Clinton shaken by rise of Sanders in early pollsAlthough nationally she polls strongly against Mr Sanders , he is neck and neck with her in Iowa , which kicks off the nominating scramble in two weeks time . And in New Hampshire , next door to his own Vermont , he may be slightly ahead .Her advisers hope her new tack will endear her to traditional Democrats as well as younger voters in Iowa . It was on vivid display in the final debate between Democrat hopefuls before the Iowa caucuses ? the primary in New Hampshire will follow a week later ? on Sunday evening in Charleston , South Carolina . Mr Sanders lambasted Ms Clinton on a range of issues , in particular what he called her far too cosy relationship with Wall Street .If Americans are fuzzy on the other Democrat runners , they may feel they already know quite enough about Ms Clinton , who has gone from US First Lady to Senator to Secretary of State , navigating serial media maelstroms along the way . It ' s exhausting to enumerate them ( Whitewater , Monica , Benghazi , the email server ) . She cried in New Hampshire in 2008 yet failed to stave off Barack Obama . Now she ' s after the nomination again . She has had a lousy campaign so far , yet this remains hers to lose .The self described Democratic Socialist Senator from Vermont is technically an Independent on Capitol Hill but almost always votes with the Democrats . Since jumping into the nomination race , he has stunned probably even himself with the huge crowds he has drawn and his success at raising money from grassroots supporters .Mr O ' Malley , the Governor of Maryland until the start of this year and before that Mayor of Baltimore , seemed well placed to challenge Ms Clinton . He has a strong record of progressive accomplishments in his state . So far , however , while his speeches are well received , his polling numbers have remained pathetic .Mr Chafee , who shod horses as a young man , was a Republican US Senator for Rhode Island who defied his party and voted against the Iraq War . In 2011 , he was elected as the state ' s governor as an Independent . Now he ' s running as a Democrat . His pet project ? He wants the US to say goodbye to Fahrenheit and go metric .Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb has dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , although he has hinted that he might still run as an independent .Ms Clinton is haunted by memories of 2008 when Mr Obama stunned her in Iowa , winning the state s caucuses that year . Although he later lost to her in New Hampshire , the damage was done . Her decision to play the continuity card , promising to build on the progressive foundation laid by Mr Obama , carries risks . She is doing it in a year when voters in both parties are showing an appetite for anything but the status quo ? thus the blast into orbit by Republicans of Donald Trump . And if she becomes the nominee , it will surely offer easy bait to Republicans , all of whom relish rubbishing the president .But that is how she went after Senator Sanders plan to introduce free health care for all in the US , along the lines of Britain s National Health Service . What that would mean , she insisted , was tearing up the Affordable Healthcare Act , or Obamacare : This is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama , of the Democratic Party and our country ? and we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance . 	 0
SALEM , IN The primary masturbation materials of Salem Middle School eighth grader Jeremy Royce were relocated to a new , safer area in his room following a close call Monday .The contraband materials , which include a 1982 " Sex In Cinema " issue of Playboy featuring onetime Hugh Hefner companion Barbi Benton a coverless copy of Gent found near the railroad tracks and a black and white photo of ninth grader Susie Sherwood in a cross country track uniform from the Salem Middle School yearbook , were transferred from the back of Royce ' s sock drawer to an area above a panel in his bedroom ' s ceiling as a result of Monday ' s incident .According to reports , at approximately 3 p . m . , Royce , 14 , returned home from school to find his four year old sister Brianna not only in his room a place , he said , she " is not allowed to play in " but actually using the sock drawer in question as an improvised play boat for her Caribbean Cruise Barbie . Upon discovering his sister playing in and around the drawer , Royce promptly drove her from the room and relocated the masturbation materials .Secondary masturbation materials , such as Kleenex , moisturizing lotion and other various household materials , " have no need to be hidden " at this time , said Royce , speaking on condition of anonymity .Royce said that Monday ' s incident ended a 10 month sock drawer residency for the pornographic materials ." Last October , I decided the sock drawer would serve my concealment purposes best , after noting that the contact paper at the drawer ' s base had become somewhat non adhesive , allowing the magazines and other paraphernalia to be safely hidden underneath , even if all the socks in the drawer were to be removed , " Royce said . " I don ' t think my sister found the crucial flap that provided access to the secret hiding spot , but , as I ' m sure you can understand , the incident gave me enough of a scare to move the materials . "With the sock drawer no longer a viable storage area , Royce has moved the masturbation materials to what he hailed as " the most foolproof , secret storage spot yet " : the inside of a panel in his bedroom ' s drop ceiling style insulation ." Nobody ever looks inside the ceiling ever , " Royce said . " And even though the ceiling ' s support struts are designed only to hold the weight of the light foam panels of the ceiling proper , I have tested them extensively and they are more than capable of handling the additional weight of the pornography . "Given the current state of masturbation material safety , Royce is confident he will be able to maintain plausible masturbation deniability well into his college years . Furthermore , the presence of 36 ceiling tiles in his bedroom means virtually unlimited future storage space for additional masturbation related materials , creating greater than ever opportunities for accumulation of pornography , should the need for such expansion arise .Monday ' s close call represents the third near discovery of masturbation related paraphernalia in the Royce household since March 1996 , prompting the second relocation in Royce ' s 18 month masturbation history .The materials were relocated to the sock drawer on October 12 , 1996 , following an incident involving his mother , Elaine ." Originally , I had the items hidden under my mattress , on the side of the bed facing the wall . It was a good spot : The magazines were pushed far enough back into the space between mattresses that they wouldn ' t likely be found , even in a crisis situation , " Royce said . " But then one day , my mom changed my sheets while I was at school . Even though I don ' t think she saw the magazines , I immediately decided it would be best to move them , not wanting to tempt fate . "Royce ' s father , Edward , the original owner of several of the magazines before their discovery last summer by the younger Royce in the woodshed , expressed approval for his son ' s new plan ." The ceiling thing sounds like it should work out fine , from how you describe it , " Royce , a public works superintendent for the nearby town of Plovis , told reporters . " I ' m just glad Jeremy got that stuff out of the sock drawer before his little sister found it . If she ' d pulled those magazines out and brought them to us , asking what they were , well , she ' s only four , and Jeremy and me both would have caught holy hell from his mother . " 	 1
The World famous Genetics Research Institute ( GRI ) , also known as ' Genny ' ( pronounced as Jenny ) recently issued a limited circulation 568 page report that details the increasing propensity of the GOP to engage in extramarital affairs and other sexual transgressions . The study was commissioned by the Democratic party and approved by Rahm Emanuel , President Obama ' s Chief of Staff .Based on reliable sources , POLITICAL NEWS PULSE discovered the existence of the clandestine project and was able to interview Genny ' s Dr Jean Baptiste Rousseau , Chief of Research , on June 25 . The latter indicated that a study was indeed commissioned soon after President Obama ' s victory in November , 2008 . The client was the U . S . ' s Democratic Party and the study was approved by Emanuel . Apparently , the Spitzer scandal struck a nerve and the Dems wanted to avoid another sexual disaster and to , especially , be able to nail the Republicans in kind .Although not stated in the proposal , the implication was that if the GOP could be caught with its pants down , the Democrats would have a major advantage in almost any election , local and national . And , because it was not classified ' Level A , ' Genny ' s designation for ' Client Only , ' Dr Rousseau was able to tell Pulse some details , although the proprietary information sourcing and evaluation methodologies employed could not be discussed .Some of the findings :In time , the results of the study will appear in major political publications on the Internet and in hard copy . In response , a combined counterattack is planned by a Limbaugh O ' Reilly Hannity conservative GOP team to discredit the findings .Said President Obama , " We ' ve got ' em by the scrotes and they ' re screaming unfair , unfair ! We beat ' em ! "Reported by Jacques Le Coq D ' Amour 	 1
The Paris attacks leave the question : why France ?Ten months ago Place de la R publique was a symbol of French defiance , now people gather in shock and disbelief . Europe correspondent Nick Miller reports from Paris .Every Western capital knows that Islamist extremists would love to strike a blow at its heart . But few are so tantalising a target as Paris .The Eiffel Tower stands illuminated on the skyline , a symbol of Parisians ' pride in their city .The short answer is that France fights jihadists worldwide has one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe ? and arguably the most divided society . It also has a steady stream of guns pouring in from across continental Europe ' s porous borders . It is a potent , explosive mix ? as shown by the Charlie Hebdo ? attacks of January ? and now the Paris shootings ." This is for Syria , " one of the Paris attackers reportedly said . But he could have said it was for Mali , or Libya , or Iraq .Indeed , France takes pride in its proactive stance against Islamists worldwide , especially in the face of what is frequently seen as British and American retreat . Over 10 , 000 French troops are currently deployed abroad ? over 3 , 000 in Western Africa , 2 , 000 in Central , and 3 , 200 in Iraq .The feelings of isolation and exclusion can be overwhelming , with few high profile Muslim role models in business or politics . France ' s stridently secular state , the banning of the burka and the power of the Front National have not helped to ease tensions between communities .Mohamed Merah , the Toulouse shooter of 2012 , grew up in a tough banlieue ? , began as a small time delinquent , was sent to prison ? and emerged a hardened jihadi with " meaning " in life .Mehdi Nemmouche , author of the May 2014 murder of four people in Brussels , was also radicalised in prison ? travelling to Syria when he was freed and then coming back to attack the Jewish museum .Ch rif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly ? both followed a similar trajectory of lack of opportunity , descent into criminality , prison and radicalisation .Inside France ' s prisons , 70 per cent of the inmates are estimated to be Muslims ? by law , France cannot ask a person to state their religion , so official data is unavailable . In England and Wales , by comparison , Muslims account for 14 per cent of the prison population , according to Home Office statistics , and five per cent of the population nationwide .In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks The Telegraph reported how France was struggling with radicalisation inside its prisons ? and , unlike Britain , had very few Imams to enter the cells , and limited de radicalisation programmes . In April Rachida Dati , the former justice minister and now a special rapporteur on radicalisation , told this paper that France was not doing enough to fight the power of Islamist radicals behind bars .And another constant source of concern for the French authorities is the ease with which weapons can be trafficked into France .Belgium has long struggled with illegal arms it is believed the Charlie Hebdo attackers sourced their weapons there .

no team has more premier league points in 2015 than liverpool and brendan rodgers'team have been on a roll. they've lost just once since the end of november, have daniel sturridge back and go into tomorrow's game at home to manchester city just two points off the top four. but thursday night's penalty shootout defeat in istanbul by besiktas was a huge blow. it's a knock to their confidence at a crucial time while, for the first time, the europa league winners qualify for the champions league, a competition liverpool need to be in. brendan rodgers has done an excellent job in recent weeks, but now he needs to keep his team positiverodgers talks to his team before the penalty exit against besiktas on thursday night in istanbulso as his weary players returned from the 4, 400 mile round trip to turkey just 48 hours before facing city, this is arguably rodgers'biggest task of the season. liverpool are great when they are on a roll but when they hit a road block we've seen that the wheels can come off. rodgers'team have shown a mental weakness in adversity before, their season starts to unravel and they can't let that happen again. it would not be a disaster if they lose to city, who will be desperate to close the gap on chelsea to three points. but if they do, rodgers needs to teach his team to move on quickly. last season they crumbled after their 16 game unbeaten run ended, throwing away a two goal lead at crystal palace a few days later to surrender the title. that sort of collapse must not happen again and it is up to rodgers to ensure that. last season, after demba ba capitalised on steven gerrard's slip, liverpool fell off the pace in the title racethrowing away a lead at crystal palace ended liverpool's title ambitions as they crumbled under pressuredefeat to besiktas will leave the squad shaken, but rodgers must ensure they don't suffer the same fatehe is such an impressive, innovative, tactical manager. he's made 3 5 2 look like a good system while louis van gaal has struggled with it. he switched to it to get more of the ball in midfield after teams started pressing steven gerrard and stopping them play. now his team are bossing possession again. he now has two sitting midfield players and two attacking ones in front, usually raheem sterling and philippe coutinho. it's very difficult to play against those two tiers of midfield. but management is as much about knowing how to control what's going on between your players'ears, helping them bounce back from adversity. one of his big strengths seems to be creating a feelgood factor. you see pictures from melwood of the players laughing and joking at training and that positive atmosphere carries onto the pitch. he has done trememdously well to turn liverpool's season around following a slow start and the seismic blow of losing luis suarez. simon mignolet has returned to form, but by publicly dropping him rodgers did the wrong thingafter teams started closing down steven gerrard, rodgers has shown his ability by changing systemshe has got more out of coutinho in his new role and drafted in the exciting jordon ibe, although it is frustrating that he is cup tied from his time at derby because no one at anfield put a clause in his loan contract. the manager's tactical nous and work on the training ground are his big strengths but you also have to say the right things to make your players walk on air. i was unsure that saying simon mignolet would be out of the team'indefinitely'earlier in the season was the right move. it might have taken weeks for mignolet to recover from that and he admitted that it was his wife, not the manager, who helped him get over it. maybe rodgers needs to work on his managerial skills a bit, to make his players feel great when things aren't going so well. rodgers has done brilliantly to bring the best out of brazilian playmaker countinho in the new systemsome of the liverpool summer signings, including mario balotelli, have been disappointing all seasonif they want another season in the champions league, now is the time liverpool have to show their classbut not everything has been perfect. why were mario balotelli and rickie lambert brought in when they don't fit the rodgers mould of closing down the opposition and working hard? and what has happened to adam lallana, who has gone from england starter to in and out the liverpool team and is a shadow of his former self? the same can be said of dejan lovren, a 20m signing from southampton who has started just one premier league game since the 3 0 defeat by manchester united in december. he was lauded as one of the best defenders 	 0

NEW ORLEANS Lady Gaga performed before a sell out crowd at The Ooh La La Convention Center in the city known as The Big Easy .After her concert , Lady G spoke in her dressing room with Tequila Tallyho of Left Coast Mirror Magazine .Miss Tallyho has interviewed such noted celebrities as Charlie Sheen , Pippa Middleton , Pamela Anderson , and the much tattooed Kat Von D .Lady Gaga was asked about the The Attack of The Zombie Emoticons which she will soon begin filming along with Ian Somerhalder and Taylor Lautner .The Lady , as Vice President Joe Biden calls her , took a sip from her bottle of Southern Comfort and remarked that she would almost be willing to do the film for free .Tallyho smiled and asked her if she had ever met either of the two actors before . Lady G thought for a moment and then replied that she had met Somerhalder briefly last summer at Derek Hough ' s Casa Cha Cha Cha where he had thrown a summertime party for President and Mrs Obama .She then said that she had met Taylor Lautner when he was dating Miley Cyrus right after he had ended his long time relationship with Lily Collins .Lady G said that Taylor and Miley were standing in line at a G Spot of The Barbaric Banshee Band concert in Redondo Beach .Tallyho asked the songstress if she could talk a little about the upcoming movie . Gaga replied that the movie is being directed by Bandini Borrapelli , who directed The Gay Barbarians Vs . The Vampires of Vancouver .In the film Lady Gaga will play the part of Agnes Wheatcracker , an unemployed pole dancer . One night around midnight Wheatcracker meets Hoyt Fantucker played by Ian Somerhalder and his cousin Winchester Nightgarden played by Taylor Lautner at a Burger Bitch Restaurant in San Francisco .The three soon become close friends and contrary to what Wheatcracker ' s grandmother Babushka McZucchini , 84 , thinks the trio does not engage in a menage a trois AKA a threesome .Lady Gaga pointed out to Miss Tallyho that it certainly was not because she did not try to get the director to have the writer write it into the script .She grinned as she took another swig from her Southern Comfort bottle and said that she would have loved for her character to have engaged the two Southern cousins in a bit of good old fashioned mattress merriment .Lady G said that according to the movie script , the trio soon decide to go camping at California ' s Yosemite National Park .And one night as they are sitting around a campfire roasting chestnuts and listening to a Rolling Stones CD they are suddenly attacked by a gang of crazed zombie emoticons .Without giving away too much of the plot the highly inebriated Fantucker , Nightgarden , and Wheatcracker literally kick the bejeebers out of the zombie emoticons who are soon seen hightailing it at an exceptionally high rate of speed for the Nevada border .Lady Gaga disclosed that as the closing credits begin to role and the film ' s theme song is sung by Ke ha , the trio will be seen quietly slipping into Wheatcracker ' s pup tent for what director Bandini Borrapelli calls a bit of obligatory vavavooming .The motion picture will be filmed on location in Lima , Peru , which has a forest that greatly resembles Yosemite National Park down to the petrified woodchucks , woodpeckers , and beavers . 	 1
Fotokol , Cameroon A Cameroonian soldier lies in a trench , the tip of his Kalashnikov rifle pointing toward the Nigerian town of Gambaru , which has been taken over by Boko Haram terrorists .A pickup loaded with Chadian troops crosses the bridge into Gambaru to reinforce their peers locked in an hours long heavy exchange of gunfire with Boko Haram fighters .A suspected terrorist attempts to cross the El Beid River , which separates Gambaru from Fotokol in Cameroon , but is hit by a bullet from a Cameroonian soldier .That battle took place on February 11 , but " fighting here has become a daily occurrence , " says Maj . Nlate Ebale of the Rapid Intervention Battalion known as BIR of the Cameroon military .Earlier this month , Boko Haram militants attacked Fotokol , burning churches , mosques and homes . They also slaughtered youths who resisted joining them . Almost 100 people died in the attack , said Col . Jacob Kodji , commander of the 4th Inter Military Region .The dusty roads of the once bustling town are now deserted . Frequent exchanges of gunfire between Boko Haram fighters and the combined Cameroonian and Chadian soldiers have driven many away . Only elderly people and some children remain , Kodji says ." Chadian troops here have the mandate to fight Boko Haram right at their base in Gambaru , " Ebale says . " We have to secure this bridge and stop the terrorists from crossing over into Cameroon . So we do work in synergy with Chadian forces here . "In February , Chadian troops launched a large offensive in Gambaru , using land and air forces , killing some 200 Boko Haram militants , Kodji says .But Boko Haram keeps coming back ." We register at least one to two Boko Haram attacks in different localities a day , " he says .Several African nations including Niger , Benin , Cameroon , Chad and Nigeria have pledged to deploy 8 , 700 troops , police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram .The violence in northeast Nigeria has caused more than 157 , 000 people to flee into Niger , Cameroon and Chad , Adrian Edwards , spokesman for the U . N . High Commissioner for Refugees , said in February . Nearly 1 million more people are believed to be internally displaced inside northeast Nigeria , according to Nigeria ' s national emergency management agency , Edwards said .Capt . Bea Hob , who commands a Cameroon BIR unit , says that on October 15 , Boko Haram carried out simultaneous attacks on the Cameroon towns of Amchide and Limani , killing eight Cameroonian soldiers and dozens of civilians .Amchide , 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) from Fotokol , borders Nigeria ' s Borno state , a stronghold of the Islamist terrorist group . Since the insurgents began regular cross border raids this year , killing hundreds of Cameroonians , most of the town ' s residents have fled south . Only a few elderly people remain , Hob says .Amchide has become a military base to protect the area from insurgents . Soldiers patrol the streets in armored vehicles and lie in trenches . But the military has become a major target for Boko Haram attacks ." It was at about 4 a . m . when we heard them shouting from four different angles of our base . Then it was clear that their intention was to strike our base . It was definitely a difficult situation to handle , given that they were coming from different directions ." I ordered that the lone tank we had should be deployed in such a way that the terrorists would think we had at least four tanks . So we would rush to one angle , shoot for about 15 minutes and then rush to the next angle , shoot for 15 minutes . . . . Within hours , we were able to put the terrorists to rout , " Hob says .He said Boko Haram has been shifting its tactics . Unable to carry out direct combat with Cameroonian soldiers , they use improvised explosive devices to ambush military convoys and civilian buses , disrupting movement of goods and people in the region .Cameroon security sources say that Boko Haram attacks villages " to steal food , carry out forced marriages on the girls they kidnap forcefully recruit children who are later brainwashed to joining their hate doctrine , as well as steal weapons . "Porous borders ease their incursions into Cameroon .A spokesman for the Cameroon Defense Ministry , Col . Didier Badjeck , says that since the war began some two years ago , Cameroon has killed more than 2 , 000 Boko Haram fighters and lost about 100 soldiers . 	 0

The Company ' s collection include Calico , Google ' s health and longevity effort Nest its connected home business Fiber , its gigabit internet arm and its investment divisions such as Google Ventures and Google Capital , and incubator projects , such as Google X . These will be managed separately in Alphabet . Over time , however , investors have grown exhausted of the lack of information around these investments , especially as the growth in the company ' s core business has slowed .

london, england some psycho named george bush ( no, he's from the erith section of london, england, and he is not, and i will repeat, he is not from the powerful, influential, republican, texas family of u. s. presidents ), has been jailed for 14 months for selling dead monkey heads and other primate body parts, along with having images of bestiality in his personal possession. bush was sentenced at woolwich crown court on monday, jan. 11, after pleading guilty to a string of charges. these weird and horrid crimes include : offering to sell body parts of a number of endangered species ( such as four monkey heads and two leopard heads ) and bush also tried to sell 134 " specimens " from macaque monkeys ( including the skeleton of an infant crab eating macaque on ebay ), according to buzzfeed news and the daily mail of the united kingdom. " he also pleaded guilty to possession of 71 extreme pornographic images of animals, " the buzzfeed news article reports. according to the daily mail, detective constable sarah bailey said :'this case shows that strong controls are in place to protect endangered species and the police will take action against anyone found to be trading illegally.'illegal trade threatens many species'survival. i would urge anyone who sees specimens from protected wildlife for sale to contact police, " detective constable bailey added in the daily mail article. the thing that's so sad about this report is that bush only received 14 months incarceration for being a veritable hannibal lecter of monkeys and other species. the dna of chimpanzees isn't all that different than ours, you know. it's almost identical, in fact. and knowing how a deranged lunatic feels about having a collection of dead monkey heads staring at him as he smokes his pipe in his living room, sharpening knives and wheezing, he'll most likely enjoy all the horrors of prison life. and when he gets out, he might graduate to trophy hunting for more advanced primates, like homo sapient apes. but then again, he might be totally reformed in prison. when he gets out, he may buy a good set of binoculars and take up bird watching. buzzfeed news reports that the monkey heads and primate parts were shipped in from indonesia. there was no mention made in the buzzfeed news article concerning the specifics of the extreme pornographic images of animals. one cannot help but wonder if george bush the weirdo from the erith area of london, england, and not, and i repeat, not, either the 41st or 43rd president of the united states, had any leading man part in any of the pornographic images of the animals found in his possession. we're only human, right? isn't it normal for us to wonder about such things? and brothers and sisters, just be grateful you're on top of the food chain and you're not a diminutive, naive, victimized macaque monkey. i let my friend and neighbor jacko read the buzzfeed news story and he was abhorred. jacko is a true animal lover and did his best at animal husbandry to raise a grizzly, a tiger, and three alligators, but the authorities raided his apartment and took all his pets away one day last summer. they were emaciated and victimized, sure, but jacko was in way over his head in raising the critters. keeping these carnivores on a steady diet of boiled rice and cream of wheat turned into a dietary fiasco. and the fact that jacko's girlfriend delilah was badly mauled by these apex ambush predators one cold february afternoon while jacko was at work and she was watching his pets really upset the u. s. a. animal welfare police and other law enforcement organizations even the nancy grace christian crusaders. " fourteen months! that's an outrage! that guy ought to get a good whack of his own bad karma! animals are people, too, " jacko wailed after reading the buzzfeed news article. " well, i don't know about all that, my friend, but i definitely feel your pain and frustration, " i said. although jacko and i disagree on nearly everything, i have to agree with him here. until the nations of the world start brandishing much stiffer penalties against those who poach, abuse, and indiscriminately kill ( usually for shits and giggles ), these poor, defenseless animals, this sort of thing will go on and on and on. i wouldn't be against sending someone like george bush ( the guy from the erith section of london, england, and not, and i will repeat, not either of the republican u. s. presidents who also have that first and last name, to prison for double digit 	 1
For Peyton , odds of finding a happy ending are getting worse and worseThat s why the Redskins were left for road kill Sunday night at FedExField , where they were trying to win their first home playoff game in 16 years .They were run over , 35 18 , by the Packers and their man behind the wheel , quarterback Aaron Rodgers , who took his struggling team and hoisted it on his back by recreating the up tempo rhythm that always has made the Green Bay offense so dangerous .The Packers entered the game having scored 21 points in their last two regular season games and the world wanted to know what was wrong with Rodgers , one of the league s true superstars .The bounce in Rodgers step had been missing . So was the infectious smile and the boyish body language of a golden retriever running free in the park .With the Packers down 11 0 and their offense again sputtering early in Sunday s game , it was as if Rodgers lit a match that sparked a flame the Redskins could not extinguish .Rodgers completed just one of his first eight passes for 11 yards in the first quarter , and then suddenly the Packers were scoring on six of the next seven possessions , outscoring the Redskins 35 7 the rest of the game .They did it because Rodgers turned the volume up on the Redskins defense . To borrow from the cult movie classic , Spinal Tap , Rodgers turned it up past 10 on the dial because when the Packers hurry up offense is humming like it was Sunday , it goes to 11 .That s us , Packers receiver James Jones said . It s tough to stop us when we re able to get moving fast like that .And Rodgers is the conductor , as good at it as anyone in the game not named Brady .The Redskins defense twice was flagged for 12 men on the field . Countless times Washington could not sub out tired players for more favorable matchups , and by the second half they were gassed .Once we got a few first downs we became like a snowball going downhill and we couldn t stop ourselves , Rodgers said . There was a time there when we were down 11 0 where people could have started to have that doubt creep in , but it didn t happen .That s 12 , man , Jones said of his quarterback . He s a future Hall of Famer , man . You guys are spoiled . When he makes one bad throw you re all on him . But to us , he plays like 12 every week . The guy has set such a high standard . You guys get on him about any and every little thing . He just came out here and played ball like he always does .Rodgers played fast . The rest of the offense followed and it was the Redskins undoing .When we get a good tempo going we re hard to stop , Jones said . When we re rolling , man , we ve got a lot of weapons that you ve got to defend .Said Packers left guard Josh Sitton said : That s when we re playing at our best ? when we can play that fast . Aaron has complete control of the entire field . He s got the ability to call pretty much what he wants and usually he gets us in the right play .Ironically , Packers coach Mike McCarthy said he noticed Rodgers was playing a little fast at the beginning of the game before settling in .He settled in to complete 14 of 20 for 148 yards and two touchdowns in the second quarter , completely changing the game for the Packers .Was Rodgers slumping at the end of the season ? Sure he was . But this was his 12th career playoff game and he was not ready to go home yet .He s a special player , Redskins coach Jay Gruden said .They did whatever they wanted in the second half , Redskins defensive tackle Terrance Knighton said .They just kept trucking , Redskins defensive back DeAngelo Hall said . They kept their foot on the pedal .Now the Packers race back to Arizona , where they have a score to settle from the 38 8 beating the Cardinals gave to them on Dec . 27 .We re coming off obviously a big win and their last game they got beat by a lot 36 6 to Seattle , Rodgers said , clearly delivering a message through the media . So , it s going to be a more competitive game , I bet . 	 0
In a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in Haiti in 2010 , a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on Earth today . The latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7 . 9 , which would actually makes it about 40 larger than the 7 . 8 currently being reported . That ' s less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10 , 000 people .Unfortunately , it is quite possible the number of dead in Kathmandu could rise to match it .We knew this disaster was coming eventually . Geophysicists have long monitored how fast the Earth ' s plates are moving , and we know that the entire subcontinent of India is being driven slowly but surely underneath Nepal and Tibet at a speed of around 1 . 8 inches per year . It ' s the reason Everest exists .Latest updates on Nepal earthquakeOver millions of years , the squeezing has crushed the Himalayas like a concertina , raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from Pakistan to Burma . Saturday ' s quake was neither unusual nor unexpected , although it was larger than most .In the 81 years since the 1934 Bihar earthquake , the land mass of India has been pushed about 12 feet into Nepal . Think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under Nepal . The spring is stuck on a broad , rough surface which we call a fault plane ( a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground ) .Fallen : Nepal ' s historic landmarksSometimes , energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically , releasing all that pent up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area . The bigger the area that slips , and the larger the pent up energy , the greater the damage .Saturday ' s slip took place over an area about 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara in one direction , and almost the entire Himalaya mountain width in the other . A part of India slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath Nepal in a matter of seconds .We have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years . Using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the U . S . Geological Survey and to universities such as Columbia , we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly .Avalanches hamper Everest rescue effortsNot just that : we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface . What used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation .In Haiti in 2010 , although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than Saturday ' s , well over 100 , 000 people are thought to have been killed around Port au Prince by the shaking and its after effects . Yet despite some differences , the Nepal and Haiti earthquakes also share similarities both geological events were known to be approaching , and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty , rapid increases in population in urban areas , uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes .About 1 . 45 million people live in Kathmandu , the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on Saturday . Nepal has a per capita income of around 1 , 350 , only a notch above that of Haiti , and among the lowest in the world .Meeting building codes in new construction , or taking on expensive retrofitting , is way beyond the means of most . To make matters worse , the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves .Studies have long predicted that the Kathmandu area was due a magnitude 8 earthquake , or higher one study predicted between 21 , 000 and 42 , 000 fatalities if a magnitude 8 . 1 earthquake had struck the area . ( Fortunately , Saturday ' s shaking was half that intensity ) .Still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for Nepal as it emerges from a long running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily . We have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead . 	 0
SUNNYVALE , CA Hoping it will push them to the top of an increasingly competitive market , Internet portal Yahoo has added soul search capabilities to its expanding line of search tools , company executives announced Monday ." Capable of navigating the billions of thoughts , experiences , and emotions that make up the human psyche , the new Yahoo soul search engine helps users find what ' s deep inside them quickly and easily , " Yahoo CEO Terry Semel said . " All those long , difficult nights of pondering your place in this world are a thing of the past . "Yahoo ' s main competitor recently introduced two new advanced search functions : Google Local , which highlights search results from a specific geographic area , and Google Personalized Search , which allows users to create a profile of their interests to influence search results . But Semel called Yahoo ' s new search function " vastly more precise . "" As the amount of information on the web increases , individuals want a search engine to provide them with results that are personally meaningful , " Semel said . " Enter the Yahoo Soul Search a powerful new tool that reveals what ' s deep inside your heart , using the user friendly interface already familiar to Yahoo fans . "In the past , a soul search was a labor intensive and time consuming process , Semel said ." A soul search often required backpacking trips across Europe , disastrous long term relationships with incompatible lovers , and years of expensive therapy , " Semel said . " Worse , the search process often included depression , lowered self worth , and intense doubt . "Semel called the old way of seeking clarity " a logistical nightmare . "" Each question you asked yourself seemed to have a thousand possible answers , " Semel said . " That ' s why we designed a way to order returns by relevance and separate them into categories like ' religion ' and ' sexuality . ' After using the Yahoo soul search engine , conducting the self examination process without a computer will seem as ridiculous as doing accounting in old fashioned ledger books . "The new search function is even customizable . Users can set their search to plumb their souls at varying depths , to make shallow discoveries or life changing ones . They can also adjust their security preferences to protect themselves from the dangers of baring their naked souls to the world , and parental controls can be enabled in order to prevent children from looking inside themselves .The new service is also hot linked to the pre existing Yahoo network instantly leading the soul searcher to pertinent information on HotJobs , Yahoo ! Shopping , and Yahoo ! Travel making it possible for users to reconfigure their entire lives with one easy soul search .Although soul searching online personal ads is not presently an option , Yahoo is developing a search engine which will allow its estimated 300 million users to find their one true soulmate .Semel admits that the soul , while eminently searchable , is far from easy to navigate . There are still dangers in the form of self deception , the soul to soul transmittable " D spair " virus , and the numerous pop up ads offering quick fix solutions to the user ' s problems ." There are bound to be some bugs , but we ' re not too worried , " Semel said . " We at Yahoo have a lot of experience in helping people navigate an environment full of falsehoods , random useless information , and truly horrifying pornography . I don ' t think the human soul will hold any real surprises for us . "Early reviews from consumers have been overwhelmingly positive ." I was skeptical , I ' ll admit , " said former Boston area investment banker Royce Creighton . " But after two minutes on Yahoo Soul Search , I found that being born into a family of bankers didn ' t mean I had to be a banker . Half an hour of advanced soul searching helped me find a buyer for my house , an alpaca farm for sale in Wyoming , and a highly recommended acupuncturist in Cheyenne . I ' ve never been happier . . . and I found all this inside myself through Yahoo ! " 	 1
Hong Kong On the same day yet another death was reported in China ' s bird flu outbreak , the World Health Organization warned the H7N9 virus was one of the most lethal that doctors and medical investigators had faced in recent years ." This is an unusually dangerous virus for humans , " Keiji Fukuda , WHO ' s assistant director general for health , security and the environment told a news conference in Beijing Wednesday ." We think this virus is more easily transmitted from poultry to humans than H5N1 , " he added , referring to the bird flu outbreak between 2004 and 2007 that claimed 332 lives ." This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far . "As investigations continue into the possible sources of infection , Fukuda warned that authorities were still struggling to understand the virus . The WHO said China must brace for continued infections .Fukuda ' s warning came as Taiwanese health authorities said they ' ve confirmed the first human case of H7N9 in Taiwan one they said was imported from China .A 53 year old Taiwanese man who worked in eastern China was confirmed to have H7N9 on Wednesday , the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control said . His condition was described to be severe .He had been traveling back and forth regularly between China ' s Jingsu province and Taiwan , health officials said ." According to the case , he had not been exposed to birds and poultry during his stay in Suzhou ( in Jingsu province ) and had not consumed undercooked poultry or eggs , " the Taiwanese CDC said .Taiwanese health officials said they are screening travelers arriving from China for signs of H7N9 .Fukuda , meanwhile , said WHO officials " are at the beginning of our understanding of this virus . "" ( The situation remains ) complex , difficult and it is evolving , " he said .So far there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission , the authorities say ." We do want to note , however , that if limited person to person transmission is demonstrated in the future , this really will not be surprising , " Fukuda warned , adding that it was critical to remain vigilant , monitoring the virus ' s spread and mutation ." We are not sure that the clusters were caused by common exposure to a source of the virus or were due to limited person to person transmission , " he said . " Moreover we have not seen sustained person to person transmission . "While some elements of the outbreak have baffled investigators specifically why the virus tends to target an elderly demographic and the fact that it is asymptomatic or mild in some cases and lethal in others authorities have claimed some significant victories in the fight against a pandemic .Anne Kelso , the director of a WHO collaborating research center , said researchers had seen a " dramatic slowdown " in human cases in Shanghai after the city ' s live poultry market was shut on April 6 . Describing the finding as " very encouraging , " she said evidence suggests the closure of live poultry markets is an effective way to stop the spread of the virus .The joint inspection team from China ' s National Health and Family Planning Commission and the World Health Organization also found that , so far , no migratory birds have tested positive for the virus , taking another worrying route of transmission out of the equation .It said the H7N9 virus is only being found in chickens , ducks and pigeons at live poultry markets .WHO officials said there are already efforts underway in other countries to develop a vaccine after Chinese officials admitted international help would be needed with this .Meanwhile , the National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 109 H7N9 cases have been reported within mainland China , including 23 deaths . Most cases have been confined to Shanghai and neighboring provinces in eastern China . 	 0
WASHINGTON President Barack Obama hosted the Tecmo Bowl champion Bulldogs at the White House Thursday , honoring the team for their stunning victory over the heavily favored Wildcats .Obama , who met with the players and coach BOB and provided a guided tour of the White House Rose Garden , commended the Bulldogs ' hard fought effort as well as congratulating the team for winning the storied franchise ' s 9 millionth Tecmo Bowl title ." What the Bulldogs have accomplished on the 8 bit gridiron is no small feat by any means , " said Obama , who smiled while holding up a personalized Bulldogs jersey . " This team ' s heart , grit , and determination inspired the world . Especially after they came back from behind to defeat the defending Tecmo Bowl champion Wildcats . "Posing for photos with players , Obama reportedly informed the Bulldogs that their 34 27 win was one of the most thrilling Tecmo Bowls that he had ever watched .Throughout the ceremony , Obama expressed his admiration for Bulldogs head coach BOB , lauding both his leadership and patience during difficult moments such as when the placekicker accidentally attempted a field goal with an empty kick meter .While Obama acknowledged that BOB ' s ability to select a receiver before the snap was nothing less than brilliant , the president said that he was more impressed that the coach was able to transform a group of relatively unknown , nondescript players into Tecmo Bowl champions ." Your victory is obviously a wonderful achievement , but the camaraderie displayed on the field will represent your true legacy , " said Obama , addressing the Bulldogs on the White House South Lawn . " This team never lost faith or gave up even after the Bulldogs quarterback threw an ' intercept ' late in the game . "" The Bulldogs trotted right back onto the field , and those 10 pixelated men played like 10 pixelated brothers , " added Obama . " You played with such courage , purpose , and resolve that the Wildcats never stood a chance . " Obama also applauded the Bulldogs ' selfless blocking , punishing side to side running game , and the perseverance of halfbacks to frantically shake free of the Wildcats ' top ranked tacklers .In addition , the president also offered the highest praise to the Bulldogs ' energetic and passionate fans for packing the stadium ' s stands and showing their unwavering support by repeatedly raising and lowering their arms .At press time , Obama was calling the Wildcats head coach ASS to congratulate the team for their recent Tecmo Bowl victory . 	 1
elizabeth mccutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint farmville, virginia, when they strolled by a home on first avenue. " something smells dead, " her friend said. richard samuel mccroskey has been arrested in connection with the killings of four people in virginia. they were thinking animal. a dog, a cat, something like that. they never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. it was thursday, september 17. but another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery. richard samuel mccroskey iii a 20 year old rapper in the underground genre of " horrorcore " who sang of chopping people into pieces has been arrested in connection with the slayings. the crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma. the victims were mark niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at walker's presbyterian church his 16 year old daughter, emma niederbrock melanie wells, emma's 18 year old friend from west virginia and niederbrock's estranged wife, debra kelley, 53, a professor at longwood university. emma was described as a fan of horrorcore and had met mccroskey through their mutual affection for the little known music genre. police said she invited mccroskey to fly from his northern california home, stay with her in virginia and then attend the strictly for the wicked festival, a horrorcore fest in michigan featuring bands with names like dismembered fetus and phrozen body boy. nobody saw what would come next. the slayings have been the talk of farmville, a town of 7, 000 that is home to longwood university and nearby hampden sydney college. senseless is the word you hear most. it's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. it's the grotesque lyrics of the horrorcore singer it's that it happened under their noses. mccroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip hop that celebrated macabre killings. he went by the name syko sam. in one youtube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags : " last night i was the murderous rage. now, i gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting. "'stinkiest rascal i've ever smelled'authorities have not specified when the virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a. m. on friday, september 18, tow truck driver elton napier was called out to poor house road to help mccroskey, whose car was stuck. napier said mccroskey was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and " was really smelling bad, like real bad. i can't describe it. " mccroskey was driving mark niederbrock's honda. napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and mccroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. at the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain. when mccroskey hopped into napier's flatbed, the tow truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows. " i just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face, " he said. " that was the stinkiest rascal i've ever smelled. " napier drove mccroskey about four miles to a convenience store. mccroskey told napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. mccroskey fetched a black bag from the honda before they parted. napier went inside to get a cup of coffee. according to police, mccroskey eventually caught a cab to richmond international airport. by mid afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on first avenue. mccroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night. when he was being led to jail, mccroskey told reporters, " jesus told me to do it. " suspect's family, community grievethe community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. memorial services were held over the weekend for emma niederbrock and her mother, debra kelley. the rev. sylvia meadows of farmville united methodist church baptized emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. the pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity. " we have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists, " meadows said. " god is stronger than evil. god is bigger. " luther glenn, a member of walker's presbyterian church where niederbrock was pastor, took issue with mccroskey's comment about jesus 	 0
chung sung jun? getty images a sunrise is seen through a barbed wire fence at the imjingak, near the demilitarized zone separating south and north korea in paju, south korea, on jan. 8, 2016. bill richardson is a former congressman, governor, u. s. ambassador to the united nations, and secretary of energy. the reported h bomb test is a reminder of the need to engage kim yong unformer u. s. ambassador : what the saudi arabia iran conflict means for stability what a turkish film can teach us about american fearthe nuclear test, reported this week by north korea as a detonation of a hydrogen bomb, is a very serious matter. while it is doubtful that this indeed was a hydrogen bomb or a different variation of a nuclear device, we cannot ignore the complex reality : the north korean nuclear program is advancing, and its leader kim yong un continues to be hostile and unpredictable. the test was not driven by a scientific need it was a political statement and a message ( or three ). first, kim jong un, is sending a message to the world : the middle east might be your top priority now, but north korea is here, and you need to deal with us, or we will continue to advance our nuclear program. detonating a device might have been the leader s response to the overwhelming dismissal in western media of his country s recent claim regarding its h bomb capacity. if the west humiliates north korea publicly by ridiculing its claims, then what other option does the leader have other than detonating a bomb to prove them wrong? second, the north koreans have been following recent u. s. engagement strategy very closely in places including myanmar, cuba and iran. they know president barack obama s term is coming to an end, and this might be their attempt to ignite engagement before the u. s. elections. but they are also sending a message : we are not iran we will not dismantle our nuclear program. having said that, it is not inconceivable that we can achieve a halt to their nuclear and ballistic tests, freeze their exports of nuclear materials to outlaw groups and states, and possibly even severely reduce their nuclear program, which today may contain as many as 10 nuclear weapons. but they will want something in return. third, you don t break eggs unless you want to make an omelet. the young leader is not raising the flames just because it is his birthday? though that might have affected the timing of the test. the leader seems to be looking for something. months after the latest crisis with south korea has been successfully defused, he is calling for attention and engagement. and while we might not like his terms, it is important to respond to his call, rather than dismiss it. we should try to understand what are the objectives hiding behind the nuclear show. the north korean economy is not sufficient to sustain the needs of its people. is the leader looking for humanitarian assistance? food supplies and aid? means to improve productivity? the only way to understand what the leader is after is to seriously engage with him. this is not about rewarding bad behavior. rather it is about making a bad situation better. the recipe for engagement is not different now than it was a few months ago during the crisis with south korea in the dmz. it is imperative that the u. s., china, russia, the e. u., and nordic countries like norway, as well as the international community, quickly step into action. meaningful engagement is key. there is no silver bullet here, just honest, difficult and intense engagement. successful engagement, in this case, requires a multi faceted approach. first, it is important that china, north korea s primary protector, accelerate its leverage and involvement. the chinese are not too happy, to say it mildly, with north korea s recent test. for the chinese this is an unnecessary escalation on its border. on the one hand, the chinese don't want a resolution of the korean peninsula conflict, as it might bring more western influence to its doorstep. yet on the other hand, the chinese have no interest in a full blown confrontation, which could result in a flood of refugees and problems into china. russia, who forged the year of friendship with north korea this past year, should also be brought into this effort. second, engagement should include both multilateral and bilateral meetings between the varying governments. simply holding multi party talks is not going to be enough. different countries hold distinct levers in such engagement, offering reassurance and flexibility in paths to reach an agreement. for example, the north koreans have always been interested in reviving talks on returning the remains of american servicemen from the korean war. perhaps some military to military talks should be considered as a first step. third, this complicated web of meetings and relations should be carefully coordinated by the international parties involved, in order to make sure 	 0
Referee Dougie McDonald is in hot water with Mums and Dads throughout Scotland after revealing in a radio interview that Santa Claus doesn ' t exist .In the wake of the controversy we decided to ask top Scottish managers their opinions on what Dougie had revealed , with some startling results .Rangers manager Walter Smith wasn ' t particularly surprised by McDonald ' s revelations . " I ' ve suspected for some time there was no Santa but as someone who gets presents every time we play a game of football it doesn ' t bother me . I won ' t have anyone question the existence of say The Loch Ness Monster though . "Hearts boss Jim Jeffries laughed off the claims . " Nae Santa ? Aye right ! Next you ' ll be claimin Tynecastle is goin tae be knocked doon for hooses ! "Rookie St Mirren manager Danny Lennon conceded that McDonald had a point . " Tell me this , how come theres loads of Santas in shops and stuff near Christmas and theres only meant to be one ? I think its just folk in suits . "Veteran Craig Brown , going great guns with Motherwell , offered this view . " Statistically there is just no way Santa Claus can circumnavigate the earth in the 24 hours offered by Chistmas Eve , so Dougie ' s integrity is intact with this one "Ex Dundee Utd legend Jim McLean shook his head when he heard the claims . " Of course there is a Santa in fact there is an established system on Lapland where he is the number one , with all his elves on 25 year contracts to be his helpers . Any elves turning up late or found to be stealing presents will be hit by a fine , and asked to exercise the reindeer for 24 hours solid . "Dunfermline Director Of Football Jim Leishman offered a unique take on the claims .No Santa Claus ? Whatever next !No fairies , pixies or ghosts exist ?Is Christmas dashed , is Yuletide destroyed ?Oh we cannot deny our kids their toys !Please , please Dougie change your wordsJust like in the papers , you lying turd 	 1
SALINA , KS Local man Scott Gentries told reporters Wednesday that his deliberately limited grasp of Islamic history and culture was still more than sufficient to shape his views of the entire Muslim world .Gentries , 48 , said he had absolutely no interest in exposing himself to further knowledge of Islamic civilization or putting his sweeping opinions into a broader context of any kind , and confirmed he was " perfectly happy " to make a handful of emotionally charged words the basis of his mistrust toward all members of the world ' s second largest religion ." I learned all that really matters about the Muslim faith on 9 11 , " Gentries said in reference to the terrorist attacks on the United States undertaken by 19 of Islam ' s approximately 1 . 6 billion practitioners . " What more do I need to know to stigmatize Muslims everywhere as inherently violent radicals ? "" And now they want to build a mosque at Ground Zero , " continued Gentries , eliminating any distinction between the 9 11 hijackers and Muslims in general . " No , I won ' t examine the accuracy of that statement , but yes , I will allow myself to be outraged by it and use it as evidence of these people ' s universal callousness toward Americans who lost loved ones when the Twin Towers fell . "" Even though I am not one of those people , " he added .When told that the proposed " Ground Zero mosque " is actually a community center two blocks north of the site that would include , in addition to a public prayer space , a 500 seat auditorium , a restaurant , and athletic facilities , Gentries shook his head and said , " I know all I ' m going to let myself know . "Gentries explained that it " didn ' t take long " to find out as much about the tenets of Islam as he needed to . He said he knew Muslims stoned their women for committing adultery , trained for terrorist attacks at fundamentalist madrassas , and believed in jihad , which Gentries described as the thing they used to justify killing infidels ." All Muslims are at war with America , and I will resist any attempt to challenge that assertion with potentially illuminating facts , " said Gentries , who threatened to leave the room if presented with the number of Muslims who live peacefully in the United States , serve in the country ' s armed forces , or were victims themselves of the 9 11 attacks . " Period . "" If you don ' t believe me , wait until they put your wife in a burka , " Gentries continued in reference to the face and body covering worn by a small minority of Muslim women and banned in the universities of Turkey , Tunisia , and Syria . " Or worse , a rape camp . That ' s right : For reasons I am content being totally unable to articulate , I am choosing to associate Muslims with rape camps . "Over the past decade , Gentries said he has taken pains to avoid personal interactions or media that might have the potential to compromise his point of view . He told reporters that the closest he had come to confronting a contrary standpoint was tuning in to the first few seconds of an interview with a moderate Muslim cleric before hastily turning off the television ." I almost gave in and listened to that guy defend Islam with words I didn ' t want to hear , " Gentries said . " But then I remembered how much easier it is to live in a world of black and white in which I can assign the label of ' other ' to someone and use him as a vessel for all my fears and insecurities . "Added Gentries , " That really put things back into perspective . " 	 1
Mother Nature showed her extremes across the United States on Tuesday , with another day of dangerously hot temperatures broiling the Southwest while parts of the Northeast grapple with flooding from torrential storms .Temperatures across much of the West will soar 10 to 20 degrees above average on Tuesday , the National Weather Service said . Forecasters issued excessive heat warnings for large swaths of California , Nevada and Arizona through the Fourth of July .By noon , the mercury had hit 98 degrees at Reno , Nevada 109 at Las Vegas 104 at Yuma , Arizona and 118 in Furnace Creek , California , in Death Valley where the heat was so intense over the weekend that it melted shoes . Triple digit forecasts were posted as far north as Spokane , Washington , and the Idaho panhandle ." Many of the same locations that broke records recently could shatter records again on Tuesday , " the weather service said .That ' s dreadful news for much of California , Nevada and Arizona , states that have all seen temperatures top 120 degrees in the past few days .Forecasters in Las Vegas noted that a similar heat wave in 2005 killed 17 people . They urged neighbors and relatives to check on those most susceptible to heat related illness children , the elderly and the chronically ill ." This is a life threatening heat event for those at risk , " the advisory warned .Heat hurts your insides , tooBecause heat stroke or heat exhaustion can strike within minutes , hundreds of Las Vegas residents have sought relief in a Salvation Army cooling shelter ." Not only do they get ( from ) the cooling station the benefit of the water that we put out , but they can also take showers , if they need to , in here for free , " Andre Ingram of the Salvation Army said . He said anyone who comes in can get as much ice cold water as they need , when " normally they walk around just looking for it . "The extreme heat is hindering efforts to stop Arizona ' s Yarnell Hill wildfire , which has scorched more than 8 , 400 acres about 13 square miles of land .The fire killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad on Sunday when fierce , erratic winds whipped the fire in different directions . Parched land from Arizona ' s drought is also fueling the fire .East Coast deluged by rainMuch of Arizona would love to get more rain . But residents on the East Coast are seeing too much of a good thing .Showers and storms will stretch from Florida to New England through Thursday , dampening the Independence Day holiday , the National Weather Service said .That ' s on top of the rainfall that quickly flooded parts of New Jersey on Monday and stranded motorists in Paramus .Thunderstorms also produced three small tornadoes in Connecticut and New Jersey on Monday , but there were no reported injuries , the weather service and local authorities said .An EF 1 twister with a top estimated wind speed of 86 mph skipped across 2 . 5 miles of Windsor and East Windsor , Connecticut , knocking down trees and blowing out electrical transformers there , Windsor Locks Police Capt . Chester Degray said .An EF 0 which packs winds between 65 mph and 85 mph touched down in Greenwich , Connecticut , about 35 miles north of New York , inflicting similar damage , the weather service said . Another EF 0 went through Berkeley Heights , New Providence and Summit , New Jersey , about 15 miles west of Newark .Drivers in Durham , North Carolina , also had to push their cars out of floodwaters on Monday . And the flooding could get worse cities from Georgia to New England could see 2 to 3 more inches of rain in the next few days . 	 0
Someone should warn Tim Tebow that the Russians are coming !Not since the old movie of the same name has there been such a frontal assault on everything as American as apple pie . And , the hot dog known as Tim Tebow is about as American as you can get .A Russian football league has offered Tim 1million to play two games with them . This is more than Rudolf Nureyev was offered to dance with at the Mariinsky Theater after he defected . Of course , once you put on the tutu , you can ' t go back .It sounds like a phone call offer from a boiler room in the basement of a fantasy league in St . Petersburg . Once in Mother Russia , Tebow may be held captive in a Moscow airport until he turns over the NFL files .The Moscow Black Storm wants Tim for their storm troopers . We suspect their league includes the Syrian team and probably the North Korean group . At least if Tim travels to North Korea , he will run into fellow American Dennis Rodman .The Black Storm team is serious in their wooing of the Christian icon . The owner has spoken to Tebow personally and learned that his agents are the real problem . They believe Tebow ' s real talent is in proselytizing the unwary and the uncircumsized .If Tebow is interested in going to Russia , he may want to look up Edward Snowden whose fantasy league includes a bunch of NFL castoffs .Apparently the Russian league is about to hold the American Football Championship with a few turncoats , double agents , and expatriates . Bradley Manning , aka Chelsea , has volunteered to go with Tebow to Russia . 	 1
Golden State ' s first game against the Nets went down to the wire , and the rematch seemed headed the same way .With one of his electrifying flurries , Stephen Curry changed things in a hurry .Curry scored 16 of his 28 points in the third quarter and the Warriors ran their NBA record start to 22 0 by beating Brooklyn 114 98 on Sunday night .Coming off consecutive 40 point games , Curry was having a relatively quiet and even puzzling night ? he missed his first three free throws ? before helping the Warriors regain control against a team that nearly beat them this season and looked capable of finishing the job this time ." Just trying to see if I could get some room and figure out a way to impact the game , " Curry said , " and things started to click . "They sure did , as Curry scored 11 points and threw a lob for Festus Ezeli ' s slam during a 15 4 run to close the third ." That ' s what great players can do . Plus , he has a great team , " Nets coach Lionel Hollins said . " He doesn ' t have to go out there and do it all the time . Last night he had 44 . Two nights ago when they were in Charlotte he had 43 . When he needs to he can and when he doesn ' t need to he takes a backseat to those guys . "Draymond Green added 22 points , nine rebounds and seven assists . Klay Thompson scored 21 for the Warriors , who won their 26th in a row overall in the regular season , one behind the 2012 13 Miami Heat for the second longest streak in NBA history .Down 75 70 with 3 : 10 left in the third , the Warriors were soon ahead 96 85 early in the fourth ." It ' s one of our biggest strengths , is that we ' re never out of a game and we ' re always one little run away from putting a game away , " coach Luke Walton said .The Warriors equaled another NBA record , tying the 1969 70 New York Knicks for the best road start at 12 0 . They visit Indiana on Tuesday .Thaddeus Young had 25 points and 14 rebounds , and Brook Lopez scored 18 for the Nets , who had their four game home winning streak snapped .Lopez missed from point blank range at the regulation buzzer on Nov . 14 and the Warriors beat the Nets in overtime at home . Walton said the Warriors let the Nets have too good a start in that one , when Brooklyn scored 36 points in the first quarter .This time , Golden State bolted to a 9 0 lead and the only reason its 30 16 advantage after one wasn ' t bigger was because the Warriors were just 5 for 14 at the free throw line ? with Curry missing all three .But with a season best 38 points on 78 per cent shooting in the second period , the Nets trimmed it to 57 54 at halftime , then moved ahead in the third .Ezeli had 12 points and Leandro Barbosa 11 off the bench . 	 0

" in recent weeks, ( city ) has commenced and finalized contractual negotiations with pep guardiola to become head coach for the 2016 17 epl season onwards, " city said in a short statement. " these negotiations were a re commencement of discussions that were curtailed in 2012.

" there has been a lot of speculation about things, " pellegrini said, " but they ( the club ) are not doing anything behind me. " city has long lived in the shadow of neighbor manchester united, but owner sheikh mansour bin zayed bin sultan al nahyan? a member of abu dhabi's ruling family? is changing the landscape of english soccer with his work at city. initially, the plan was about short term success, as the club spent more than 1 billion to improve the squad and change its status from plucky underachiever to serial trophy winner. the next phase came in 2014 with the opening of the club's lavish 300 million training and player development center? the city football academy. a muddy wasteland with no opportunities in a neglected area has been regenerated into a sprawling, 80 acre state of the art campus that houses all of city's teams and has educational facilities and accommodation. now, it's the arrival of guardiola that will send another statement of intent to its rivals. copyright 2016 the associated press. all rights reserved. 	 0
' It absolutely must be defended ' : Tine Fey responded to the shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo today , saying it ' s a reminder of the importance of defending free speechFunny woman Tina Fey turned serious this morning when she was asked to weigh in on the tragic shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo .The attack , which has left a dozen dead so far , is believed to have been carried out by Muslim radicals furious with the publication ' s parody of the prophet Mohammed .' Obviously , that news is terrible and tragic and upsetting , ' Fey said Wednesday morning , at a television press event in Pasadena , California .' You look at that and you look at the controversy surrounding The Interview , it makes you think about how important free speech is and how it absolutely must be defended .' We cannot back down on free speech in any way . We all have to stand firm on the issue of free speech , ' she said .Both Charlie Hebdo ' s cartoons and The Interview have been criticized for their base humor , which some have argued is not worth the controversy they sparked .But Fey says it doesn ' t matter the quality or type of humor , all speech should be defended no matter what .' We ' re Americans , and even if it ' s dumb jokes in The Interview , we have the right to make them , ' Fey said .A reporter went on to ask Fey if she had ever felt pressure to censor herself when dealing with controversial topics .She responded that she often dealt with such topics anchoring Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live .' But even that was a different era , because in a social media era where you make a joke on American TV and it can go worldwide , it ' s a different environment , ' Fey detailed .During her time writing and starring on long running comedy 30 Rock , Fey also parodied the North Korean regime by casting actress Margaret Cho to play Kim Jong il , current DPRK leader Kim Jong un ' s father and ppredecessorFey spoke on the first day of the Television Critics Association winter tour in order to promote her new series on Netflix , Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt .Senseless : Parisians march in the streets following the horrifying shooting at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on WednesdayFey ( left ) attended the press conference Wednesday to promote her new Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt .

Paul Jewell walked out of West Bromwich Albion after only a week in the job after being asked to accept a pay cut that in turn would cover the salary of another new coach Gerry Francis .In consultation with his legal team the former Wigan , Ipswich and Derby manager is now understood to be considering a case of constructive dismissal .Having agreed the terms of his employment to become assistant head coach to new boss Tony Pulis indeed he was even sent a draft of his contract by the club Jewell was then staggered to find himself being asked to accept a revised salary package .Paul Jewell left West Bromwich Albion after only a week as assistant head coach to Tony PulisThis , Sportsmail understands , was a request made by Pulis but only after it was made clear to Pulis by his new employers that he could not add Francis to his team if it meant spending more than the agreed figure on his new backroom staff .Jewell and fellow coach Dave Kemp were asked to consider a pay cut believed to be less than 20 , 000 each last Friday , with Jewell returning on Monday to say that , having given the matter some thought , he was leaving after only seven days into his new role .While the 50 year old had not signed the original contract , believed to be worth well in excess of 100 , 000 a year , he had already begun working for the club on those fiscal terms and he felt his new employers had unilaterally altered his payment .The news comes as a blow to Pulis , who is looking to guide West Brom to Premier League safetyWhile West Brom do not deny the request for a pay cut was was behind Jewell ' s departure , they insisted they had not broken any agreement with Jewell . ' We would dispute most strongly any suggestion that we have reneged on a deal , ' said a spokesman .But a club that has been accused of penny pinching in the past does appear to have lost a valuable member of its new coaching staff over what seems to be a relatively small amount of money .Angered by reports in Wednesday ' s newspapers that he had left by mutual consent , Jewell issued a statement of his own .Gerry Francis has replaced Jewell at West Brom , continuing a seven year working partnership with Pulis' My departure was not by mutual consent , ' he said . ' It is in the hands of my lawyer . I will not be making any further comment at this stage . ' An official club statement issued on Tuesday night said only : ' Paul Jewell decided that he will not be continuing his recent assistance on a more formal basis . 'Jewell ' s appointment represented a bold move by Pulis , who likes to surround himself with experienced deputies . His working relationship with Francis now enters a seventh year .The former QPR and Tottenham manager had been helping West Brom informally on a part time basis since the 7 0 Cup win over Gateshead earlier this month .Asked by Sky on Wednesday if he was unaware of the reasons behind Jewell ' s departure , he said : ' I ' ve no idea .

SARASOTA , FL Through the ups and downs of raising four children , years of financial hardship , and all the stresses and turmoil of daily life , claims adjuster Arnold Schneider has stayed true to his wife of 42 years , despite his most determined efforts to engage in sexual intercourse outside of wedlock ." I could never be unfaithful to Helen , " said the 63 year old Schneider , who over the past four decades has unsuccessfully attempted extramarital relations with dozens of friends , acquaintances , work colleagues , and random strangers . " Sure , there have been some tough times , and we all have moments of doubt , but Helen is the woman I love . "Added the man who has attempted to trade his wife in for the first willing female participant hundreds of times over , " Even I ' m amazed by that sometimes . "According to sources close to the couple , Schneider has remained grudgingly loyal and devoted to his wife from the very beginning , failing time and again to cheat on his unsuspecting bride during their honeymoon together in Acapulco ." I ' ll never forget Mexico the beaches , the stars , the amazing food and people , " said Schneider , who , as his new wife lay sound asleep in bed , would routinely sneak out of their hotel room and try in vain to hit on the young cocktail waitress tending bar downstairs . " It was perfect . Pretty much almost perfect . "Over the next decade , Schneider remained faithful to his wife by default , repeatedly coming up short during his regular jaunts to singles clubs , at neighborhood key parties , and through the general freewheeling sexual bacchanalia of the 1970s ." It was a crazy time and a lot of my friends didn ' t think twice when it came to breaking the sacred bonds of marriage , " said Schneider , who despite throwing himself at any available woman in his presence , completely failed to capitalize on his adulterous tendencies . " But not me . No sir . "" Not even once , " Schneider added with a heavy sigh .Despite being left with no choice but to stay committed to his marriage , the reluctant husband and father admitted that being loyal wasn ' t always so easy . With a growing family and increased tension at work , Schneider said there were times when he could have taken comfort in the arms of another ." Yes , there were moments when I found myself on the verge of the unthinkable , " said Schneider , who once drove 300 miles to meet an old girlfriend from high school , only to be flatly rejected by the woman and have coffee thrown in his face . " Still , for one reason or another , I just couldn ' t go through with it . And when it was all over , I could look myself in the mirror and say , ' Forty two years , and you ' ve never been with anyone besides your wife . ' Forty two goddamn years . "Schneider acknowledged that even in less troubling times he occasionally felt restless after four decades with the same partner . But whether he was being stood up by the woman who answered his personal ad , or unsuccessfully attempting to persuade his wife ' s more attractive sister to visit a clothing optional spa , Schneider said that what mattered most was that he never once wavered ." Heck , I ' ve got eyes , and I ' ll notice a pretty face just like anyone else , " said Schneider , who at press time was still hoping to hear from a pancake house waitress he had given his business card to three weeks earlier . " But what can I say ? There ' s an ultimate line Arnold Schneider just can ' t cross . I ' m not even sure I ' d know how , to tell you the truth . "For her part , Helen Schneider said she had no doubt that , through it all , her husband has always been faithful ." Maybe I ' m na ve , " Helen said , " but I ' ve known this man most of my life , and I just can ' t imagine him cheating on me . Honestly , Arnie ' s my little saint . " 	 1
With accident rates on British roads at an all time low , it has been necessary to bring in new traffic laws in order to provide the existing force with crimes to arrest people for ." We had a bit of a brainstorm , " said traffic officer , Nick Themall . " We ' ve come up with a few new laws we can enact . "The first law to be passed will see anybody not setting off within five seconds of a traffic light changing to green being forced to retake their driving test ." There will be exceptions , " said Themall , " like if you ' ve not set off because an arthritic tortoise is crossing in front of you , or a policeman has lain down to prevent you setting off . In both off these cases , you should run them over . "It is now a moving violation to turn right without indicating ." Although , we ' ll let you go left without an indicator , " said Nick . " At least for now . "If right turners are spotted in the outside lane of a roundabout , they will be hung drawn and quartered in front of their families ." This seems extreme , " said Nick . " But when it happens , it ' s bloody annoying ! So we think the punishment fits the crime . "The final new infringement will be having fog lights on when it ' s not foggy ." They ' re called fog lights for a reason , " said Themall . " The punishment , again , first the crime , we think . They will be forced to drive backwards everywhere they go for a week . " 	 1
Scientists have finally proven that there is a big disconnect in the minds of those heavily into pot . It has been long suspected that marijuana use has negative effects upon the brains and bodies of partakers , a claim equally long denied by the users ." It is obvious from our recent studies that pot users cannot distinguish reality from fiction . " put forth William Smartguy , head researcher at the Westmoreland Clinic for Studying Dopes and Dope Fiends . " Despite years of reports coming out of Mexico and Latin America of the atrocities committed by cartels involved in the marijuana trade they cannot escape their idea that weed is a harmless plant that makes everyone a happy hippie . "Doctor Smartguy performed experiments on hundreds of test subjects none of whom could see the connection between the viscous cartels and the delivery of their oh so precious weed that had become their very reason for living . " It doesn ' t matter how many beheadings , acid baths , hangings or shootings go on down there or even in the U . S . , they either cannot see how they are connected to their usage or refuse to . "" Reality denial seems to come with constant pot usage . Why , we even had one guy who cut off his foot while mowing high and kept going , refusing to listen even when his wife picked it up and showed it to him . "" Just to give an example of how strong this refusal to recognize facts is , we did an experiment where we shipped a few of these test subjects down below the border with t shirts on that said " Cartels suck ! " and " American pot only ! " on them , let them smoke up and set them free . We were able to see through micro cameras we had on them that these guys didn ' t even wake up to reality while the cartel strong arms were hacking them to pieces with machetes . "In another experiment subjects were shown actual footage of cartel executions with head shots and beheadings and the bodies being dropped in tubs of acid afterwards to get rid of the evidence . All the participants had to say was " Cool , man ! Awesome flick ! Is that out on DVD yet ? "In closing Doctor Smartguy said to us that the only answer he could see to solve this problem would be for the pharmaceutical companies to invent a drug that would return a sense of reality to the users of drugs . This statement sent a shock of fear into all of the test participants , almost causing them to riot . " A drug that makes us see reality ? Why , that is what we were trying to escape from when we used drugs in the first place ! " said one participant in horror . 	 1
OCONOMOWOC , WI Substitute teacher Pamela Krafft totally freaked during third period , freshman class sources at August Derleth Memorial High School reported at lunch Tuesday ." Mrs Krafft totally lost her shit during social studies , " said Darin Thompson , one of the 30 students who witnessed Krafft ' s meltdown . " Some of the guys in the back of the room were giving her a hard time , and suddenly , she just blew it . It was like someone ripped off her human face to reveal some kind of rampaging beast underneath . "Although accounts of Krafft ' s phenomenal breakdown vary , due perhaps to the highly charged emotional atmosphere of the event , some facts have been established . It is known that Krafft , who has a reputation for her non confrontational approach to substitute teaching , showed signs of stress 20 minutes into third period . After several of her requests for quiet were ignored , Krafft reportedly took a harder line ." Krafft said , ' Cut out the misbehavior and smart remarks , or else , ' " Thompson said . " She never talks like that . Her face was all red , too , and her voice was shaky . "Rather than heed Krafft ' s warning , the unruly students continued to laugh , throw things , and issue unnecessary restroom trip requests .It was during the 38th minute of the 50 minute class that Krafft allegedly lost it altogether ." It sounded like all hell broke loose in there , " said math teacher Hank Sanders , who was conducting a sophomore Algebra 2 class in the neighboring classroom . " I don ' t know what happened , but I can assure you that it wasn ' t pretty . "Members of the social studies class were able to give a more thorough account ." She started looking for something on the desk maybe the lesson plan book , or a pen to write people ' s names down but she accidentally knocked her coffee on stuff , and some kids started laughing , and then she just freaked , " Thompson said . " First , she slammed her palm down on the desk , then she kicked a metal wastebasket , and then she knocked this pile of books off Grace Wendemeyer ' s desk . "Sources said that , after picking up two erasers that had fallen off the chalk ledge and clapping them together in a bizarre show of anger , Krafft stormed out of the room , vowing never to return . Roughly one minute later , she returned , attempted to resume class , and instructed students to open their books . In the process of putting on her glasses , however , she accidentally poked herself in the eye , at which point the uncharacteristic display of hysteria resumed .Students and teachers in neighboring rooms remained glued to their seats , paralyzed with fear and confusion , as Krafft issued near random disciplinary actions against the students , hurling pink detention slips and parent teacher conference request forms with undisguised contempt , screaming obscenities all the while ." I heard the sub scream , ' Go to hell , ' " said senior Kyle Riggs , who overheard the commotion from the classroom across the hall . " Then there was some banging , and she said , ' I don ' t get paid enough to take this shit , ' and then something about a babysitter . "Approximately eight minutes after the conniption fit began , it was over . Krafft reportedly fumbled with the locking file cabinet beside her desk , pulled out her purse , and disappeared down the hall . Administrative sources said Krafft passed through the front office into the parking lot , where she got into her 1996 Geo Metro , slammed the door , and tore off down Walnut Street .Krafft has not returned to the school since the incident ." None of us had any idea that Mrs Krafft was capable of such brute rage , " Thompson said . " We thought she was a pushover , and that we could get away with hassling her . And we did , for weeks . But we have now reaped the bitter harvest that underestimating Mrs Krafft sowed . "Principal Bob Colmes said that although no black mark will be placed on Krafft ' s record , she " isn ' t likely to be asked to return to Derleth High any time in the immediate future . " Colmes said regular social studies teacher Jack Hargrove , who ' s out sick with pneumonia , will return next Monday . In the meantime , Hargrove ' s class will be taught by Colmes ." Man , those freshmen really screwed up this time , " senior Kyle Ewan told reporters . " Colmes is a real hardass . It ' s going to be as bad as the time those juniors made the music teacher cry . You can bet he ' s going to let them have it , and good , for messing with that sub . " 	 1
( New York NY ) Showing up for her guest stint on this week ' s " Saturday Night Live " , Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin took time out for an impromptu press conference . One of her answers has both parties claiming it for their own agenda . When asked what Governor Palin thought of " Saturday Night Live " she said , " ' Saturday Night Live ' is funny . You betcha ! " The phrase was followed by Governor Palin ' s wink , now trademarked .John McCain at a rally in Pennsylvania took time out to highlight the quote . " How about that Sarah Palin ! She knows that " Saturday Night Live " is funny . That ' s just the plain , straight shooting kind of talk we ' re going to bring to Washington . You ask this woman a question , and by God you get an answer . What more could you want ? "Barack Obama ' s campaign strategist David Axlerod immediately took up Senator McCain ' s rhetorical question and turned it into an interrogative when interviewed on CNN ' s " Situation Room " . " Sarah Palin answers questions like ' What do you think of developing new forms of energy ? ' with ' Developing new forms of energy is good . ' Is that really answering the question ? "To which stout and conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh answered Axelrod on his show , " The point is does Sarah Palin answer questions ? And the answer is yes . I think looking any further is simply another form of the Democratic left bending the truth to suit their agenda . "To which CNN ' s political analyst and supporter of Democratic President candidate Barack Obama Roland Martin responded , " Rush Limbaugh says answering a question is enough . I have a three year old Boston Terrier named Winkie . Every morning I ask Winkie , ' Does Winkie want to wee wee ? ' And Winkie brings me his leash . I guess in the McCain administration Winkie might not be fit for the Vice Presidency but based on Sarah Palin certainly a cabinet position . "John McCain came to the side of his running mate at an AARP shuffleboard tournament he was attending at Century Village , Florida . " It ' s time for a little straight talk . And you know I feel this is an important issue if I ' m willing to let it cut into my shuffleboard time . This country is in its current state because no one was asking questions . Well , now people are asking questions , and Governor Palin is giving them answers . Answers , they don ' t want to hear , because it ' s the truth . Friends , " Saturday Night Live " is funny . "At lease one McCain supporter is not buying it though . Joe " Not the plumber " Wurzelbacher took time out from the taping of his new DIY show on SpikeTV to weigh in . " I like John McCain . Sarah Palin is a piece . But I ' ve seen " Saturday Night Live " , and I ' ve seen " Frank TV " and " SNL " is no " Frank TV " . 	 1

Egypt ' s president , Abdel Fatah al Sisi , is claiming his recent response to Mr Kerry ' s ear was inspired by world cup soccer player Luis Suarez , and " couldn ' t be avoided . "After the recent verdict concerning the Al Jazeera journalists , Mr Kerry , who had flown on to Brussels , immediately returned to Egypt . The incident took place shortly afterwards .Only the day before Mr Kerry had reassured the Egyptian president on renewed US aid , including attack helicopters . He also spoke of the need for Egypt to improve its " human rights record . "The verdict of 7 10 years handed out to Al Jazeera journalists the next day is widely seen as a smirk on the face of Mr al Sisi .The sentencing is also considered wrong and without evidence , targeting journalists whereas they had been simply reporting events as reporters are supposed to do .Meeting Mr al Sisi once again Mr Kerry could hardly wait to say , " Didn ' t I tell you that the United States expects more attention to human rights ? And this Al Jazeera case "At this point the Secretary had turned his head slightly to gaze out a window when Mr al Sisi " lunged " and sank his considerable incisors into Mr Kerry ' s right ear .According to the President ' s office the Luis Suarez " bite maneuver " had been under study for some time in Egyptian ruling circles .Officially , the behavior is in line with general barbarity , but not without honor .And it applies whether in a " sporting " contest or in making a statement of some sort , as with jihadists in Iraq biting off territory here and there .The bite is clearly worse than the bark , ancient wisdom Mr al Sisi has savored for some time . Return to Mubarak style rule would demonstrate the pith in this proverb .As further explanation Mr al Sisi is a regular enthusiast of having guests and the populace of Egypt abide by his wishes . This would mean not crossing him in respect to two possible consequences :being jailed for long periods , including isolation and torture following ideas in various manuals circulating in the civilized worldbeing assailed by his personal bite , which he is savoring while welcoming opportunities to practice , at moments , in defense of " the honor of Egypt . "Mr al Sisi ' s office representative continued that of course Egypt could use the attack helicopters , tanks , etc . provided by the United States , but such bargaining chips did not mean falling in line with supposed western " values . "Moreover , if the situation in Egypt continued from here to threatening people with jail time , and even execution , as with failing to vote for Mr al Sisi in the future , that was none of the world ' s business . Especially Mr Kerry ' s .Meanwhile , the Secretary was flown quickly to the US for repair or possibly transplant work on his ear .A prosthetic ear with capacity to release small missiles into the jaw of an assailant is being sought .These developments , however , will not affect US military aid to Egypt . 	 1
If I have to hear Barack Obama dodge one more question about abortion , I swear I ' m going to strangle myself with this umbilical cord . I don ' t know how many times I have to tell you people : Life begins at conception , every life is sacred , and if you don ' t like it , you can suck my big , fat unborn dick .It ' s the same old BS from these blue state liberals . A fetus isn ' t a human being , they say . A fetus is just a group of congregated cells . A fetus doesn ' t have consciousness , identity , or intent . Well , you out of touch elitists , how ' s this for intent : the moment I get my placenta covered ass out of here , you ' re going to wish you had me terminated , because I want my country back , and I ' ll do whatever I can to reclaim those values that made it great .Speaking of which : Who ' s gonna stop all the illegal immigrants in this country ?Are we just going to let every last Pedro and Maria swim across the Rio Grande whenever they damn well please to milk our system for everything it ' s worth ? If I weren ' t still in the embryonic stage of fetal development , and didn ' t more closely resemble a tadpole than a human being , I ' d round up the whole lot of freeloaders and kick them out myself .Jesus Christ , this is America learn the cognitive skills required to speak the language !One thing ' s for damn sure : no Mexican is going to climb over these uterine walls . Sorry , Paco , or whatever your name is . We ' re all closed up . No jobs to steal inside here .What ' s the matter ? Did I come on a little too strong for you liberals out there ? Did I offend your delicate sensibilities ? Well , you better get used to it , because I have plenty more to say , and thanks to United States Code , Title 18 , Chapter 1 , Section 1841 , there ' s nothing you can do about it .That ' s right , go ahead and try to lay one finger on me . I ' ll have Evangelical Christians on your doorstep so fast , it ' ll make your head spin .Just say the word . 	 1
WASHINGTON After months of committee meetings and hundreds of hours of heated debate , the United States Congress remained deadlocked this week over the best possible way to deny Americans health care ." Both parties understand that the current system is broken , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Monday . " But what we can ' t seem to agree upon is how to best keep it broken , while still ensuring that no elected official takes any political risk whatsoever . It ' s a very complicated issue . "" Ultimately , though , it ' s our responsibility as lawmakers to put these differences aside and focus on refusing Americans the health care they deserve , " Pelosi added .The legislative stalemate largely stems from competing ideologies deeply rooted along party lines . Democrats want to create a government run system for not providing health care , while Republicans say coverage is best denied by allowing private insurers to make it unaffordable for as many citizens as possible ." We have over 40 million people without insurance in this country today , and that is unacceptable , " Sen . Orrin Hatch ( R UT ) said . " If we would just quit squabbling so much , we could get that number up to 50 or even 100 million . Why , there ' s no reason we can ' t work together to deny health care to everyone but the richest 1 percent of the population . "" That ' s what America is all about , " he added .House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R OH ) said on Meet The Press that Republicans would never agree to a plan that doesn ' t allow citizens the choice to be denied medical care in the private sector ." Americans don ' t need some government official telling them they don ' t have the proper coverage to receive treatment , " Boehner said . " What they need is massive insurance companies to become even more rich and powerful by withholding from average citizens the care they so desperately require . We ' re talking about people ' s health and the obscene profits associated with that , after all . "Though there remain irreconcilable points , both parties have reached some common ground in recent weeks . Senate leaders Harry Reid ( D NV ) and Mitch McConnell ( R KY ) point to Congress ' failure to pass legislation before a July 31 deadline as proof of just how serious lawmakers are about stringing along the American people and never actually reforming the health care industry in any meaningful way ." People should know that every day we are working without their best interests in mind , " Reid said . " But the goal here is not to push through some watered down bill that only denies health care to a few Americans here and a few Americans there . The goal is to recognize that all Americans have a God given right to proper medical attention and then make sure there ' s no chance in hell that ever happens . "" No matter what we come up with , " Reid continued , " rest assured that millions of citizens will remain dangerously uninsured , and the inflated health care industry will continue to bankrupt the country for decades . "Other lawmakers stressed that , while there has been some progress , the window of cooperation was closing ." When you get into the nuts and bolts of how best not to provide people with care essential to their survival , there are many things to take into consideration , " Rep . Michele Bachmann ( R MN ) said . " I believe we can create a plan for Americans that allows them to not be able to go to the hospital , not get the treatment they need , and ultimately wither away and die . But we ' ve got to act fast . "For his part , President Barack Obama claimed to be optimistic , even saying he believes that a health care denial bill will pass in both houses of Congress by the end of the year ." We have an opportunity to do something truly historic in 2009 , " Obama said to a mostly silent crowd during a town hall meeting in Virginia yesterday . " I promise I will only sign a clear and comprehensive health care bill that fully denies coverage to you , your sick mother , her husband , middle class Americans , single parent households , the unemployed , and most importantly , anyone in need of emergency medical attention . "" This administration is committed to not providing health care , " Obama added . " Not just for this generation of Americans , but for many generations to come . " 	 1
Rapper Diddy has confirmed he will team up with actor Vince Vaughn and Tyne and Wear comic Sarah Millican to record ' Prostitute Alley ' , a song idea inspired by the comic ' s tale of how she has to negotiate through a Manchester alley packed with sex workers to reach her front door .The trio came up with the concept when they appeared on the BBC ' s The Graham Norton Show .On the programme , the South Shields born Millican said that in order to get to her flat in Manchester she walks through an alley where women engaged in the world ' s oldest profession sell their wares ." I live in a nice flat but you ' ve kind of got to walk through what I call Prostitute Alley but they don ' t normally bother me , I ' m not really what they ' re looking for , " she said .After Millican performed an impromptu performance of Diddy ' s ' Bad Boy For Life ' , an inspired Vaughn said : " When you first started the conversation , I thought Prostitute Alley was a dream not any more , now I know it ' s a reality . We ' re going to do this thing . "Diddy too seemed inspired , saying that Millican should " speak from her heart " and " write songs that are true to her " et voila , Prostitute Alley was born .Talking about the project , Diddy said it was " inspired by Manchester street culture " ." Sarah ' s coming out Monday , we ' re going to hit The Blue Room in Manhattan and bust it out . "Diddy said he would " mastermind " the production of the track , saying he planned to walk around New York ' s sex districts prior to the recording , to inspire Vaughn and Millican ." We ' re gonna pimp on this song , let me tell you , " he said . 	 1
Hungary ' s quiet arrival into the European Union has given way to a blazing row after the Magyars declared ' marijuana is good for you ' in a bold bid to boost tax revenue .The country ' s new approach to ' soft drugs ' , however , has met hard line opposition from other EU leaders in Brussels who have slammed the Hungarians as " irresponsible pot pushing peddlers of death , disease and moral decay " .That particular outburst came from the moral high ground of the United Kingdom which has nurtured and preferred its own legion of ' lager louts ' to the more soporific pursuits of the Netherlands and now Hungary .Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that the EC could be plunged into a political crisis if the lax approach on marijuana and cannabis was not replaced with far more robust legislation .But with Peter Medgyessy , the Hungarian PM , already announcing his decision to step down from office , his attitude towards Mr Blair was relaxed , but far from conciliatory .In an approximate translation , Mr Medgyessy said : " Calm down man , chill out what you need is a really good hit . Will I skin up ? "The Member states were not totally united behind Mr Blair . The Dutch , all wearing MP3 players , seemed totally nonplussed over the situation while the Belgian contingent remained silent , raising suspicions that its stance was linked to the sudden increase in chocolate exports to the former communist state .Hungary ' s legalisation of the Class C drug came with the cultivation of 1 , 200 , 000 hectares of the Great Plain , already home to thousands of orchards , vineyards and bountiful farms .This year ' s mixture of blazing sunshine , high humidity and an abundance of rain saw the hemp crop surpass all expectations . The average plant , with the Hungarian growers opting for a Northern Light Haze hybrid , soared well above 2 . 5m . This first crop is expected to finally surpass 125 , 000 tonnes .The Magyar government has levied a hefty tax rate on marijuana and resin sales with a kilo of high quality , top leaf ' grass ' selling for 4 , 126 HUF ( approx 20 ) .While this is still an expensive luxury for many ordinary Hungarians , it is a bargain basement price for tourists .Villagers have been quick to capitalise by setting up ' stoner stalls ' and the city of Kecskem t has even introduced a special ' smoking park ' where tourists can relax with a giant pipe while listening to Hungarian cover versions of Grateful Dead recordings .Breaking News : Backpackers busted 	 1
A nation reels in shock as it realizes that Socialists have won the beloved American institution called the Super Bowl .Beating the genuinely capitalistic Pittsburgh Steelers by a 31 to 24 margin , the Green Bay Packers won the game that is at the heart of all things American . Not letting on that they are an entity entirely owned by the people of Green Bay and not a corporation owned organization as are most football teams , the Socialist Packers have managed to ingratiate themselves deeply into the nations social fabric , psyches and pocketbooks over the years .This unusual partnership is a leftover from the early days of football when teams were sponsored and subsidized by the local community .These were also the days before the public was made aware of the dangers of such Socialization by such stalwartly patriotic individuals and organizations as FOX News , Newt Gingrich , J . Edgar Hoover and the soon to be canonized Ronald Reagan .So canny was their rise in the public light that their semi communist ways successfully slithered under the ever observant severe scrutiny of anti Bolshevik demigods Hoover and Reagan . Now this insidiously virulent form of anti Capitalism is being celebrated through the most beloved sports event in America and being splashed jubilantly across every media venue possible , even the archly conservative FOX News .FOX News , the sponsors of the Super Bowl , were embarrassed by their oversight ." Umm . . . . mumbled Glenn Beck , " Well they do sell sweatshirts and pennants . That makes them sort of capitalistic . "" At the price of their tickets I would say they are true blooded , patriotic , money sucking , all American gougers ! " added Sean Hannity .Others had harder things to say " They should be packed up on the same Viking ship that brought them over and taken back to their Communist European homeland ! " states Sarah Palin , official spokeswench ( in her eyes anyway ) for all things Conservative ." It is a horrible travesty for these social parasites to receive the adulation and money that they do from the American public . They are not like me and my daughter Bristol who go around the country and work hard flappin ' our gums about bein ' patriotic and not getting knocked up ! "It has been noted that Mrs Palin has added her notorious cross hair symbol over the town of Green Bay as being another target for Republicans to shoot for in the next election .Newt Gingrich , lead miscreant of the Republican party voiced his concerns as well " Football is a historic and time honored American institution which we cannot allow to be impregnated by dangerous Bolshevik foreign ideas such as Socialism . The Green Bay Packers need to be brought back into the fold by being taken over by a good , patriotic corporation such as AIG or Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs or one of our other fine , democratic capitalistic enterprises ." We can not have such a high profile group like the Packers being ' owned by the people ' for God ' s sake . If they will not do this , then I suggest sending in the National Guard to take control and letting them run things until a proper buyer could be found ." We might consider moving the Packers to a more Red state for future games Wisconsin has always been a pretty Commie state to begin with . I personally think Illinois could use another team . " After making this statement Mr Gingrich was informed by the FBI that a huge contingent of outraged Wisconsin hunters were heading out to use him as target practice . "I tried to contact Green Bay officials to verify parts of this story but unfortunately the entire state of Wisconsin was too drunk to answer our calls . 	 1

The revelation will increase speculation that the conclusions of the long delayed inquiry could be made public in the coming months .Tony Blair and Jack Straw are among those thought to have received letters in recent weeks warning them of any criticisms to be made by Sir John Chilcot .Whitehall sources have told the Mail the letters were sent out ' some time ago ' .In May David Cameron said he expected the report to be published ' before the end of the year ' .He added : ' The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn ' t have to wait too much longer . 'But just four weeks of the Parliamentary term remain making it unlikely that it will be published before MPs recess for Christmas .By law , anyone who will face criticism of a public inquiry must be sent a letter warning them of the contents .They are then permitted to challenge any negative findings .These so called ' Maxwellisation ' letters are the result of a court challenge by Robert Maxwell who overturned the verdict of a critical report in 1969 .Legal wrangling between participants who want to challenge any personal criticisms contained in the report could cause further delay .Senior Labour figures will fear the publication of the inquiry ' s conclusions in the run up to the election , knowing it will remind the public of the divisive conflict and re open old wounds within the party .First launched by Gordon Brown in July 2009 , the Chilcot inquiry began its hearings in November that year and finished taking formal evidence in 2011 .But lengthy delays were caused by arguments between Sir John Chilcot , the inquiry ' s chairman and the US and British governments over the publication of correspondence between Mr Blair and President George W Bush .Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his long awaited report would publish only ' the gist ' and some quotes of Mr Blair ' s messages to Mr Bush . The US president ' s replies will not be published in any form .Sir John said this was vital in order for people to understand the inquiry ' s conclusions . Families of servicemen killed in the Iraq conflict condemned the decision not to publish the documents in full .The report has been hit with delays because of arguments over whether correspondence between Blair and President George Bush should be included in fullThey said it meant they might never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war .Earlier this year Mr Blair insisted he was not the reason for the delay in publishing the report . The former prime minister said he resented suggestions that he was holding it up .He said the ' sooner it is published the better ' .' I have got as much interest as anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position , ' Mr Blair said .Figures released in recent weeks show the cost of the inquiry is set to top 11million . Senior figures , including Mr Blair , are expected to have their legal bills for the inquiry paid by the taxpayer .Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker , a critic of the war , said the report should be published ' as soon as possible ' .' This has gone on long enough . People have a right to know when they vote in May about the roles of those involved in taking Britain to war . '' People may argue it is political to publish it before May , but I would argue it would be political not to do so . 'A spokesman for the Chilcot inquiry declined to comment .A spokesman for Mr Blair ' s office said : ' No comment ' .Mr Straw could not be reached for comment . 	 0
HOLLYWOOD , CA Paul Reiser , situation comedy megastar , celebrity legend , and beloved creator of laughter , brought much joy to his tens of millions of loyal fans yesterday when he said that he would welcome the opportunity to direct a full length feature film .Following the announcement , all sources confirmed without hesitation and without prompting that the Beverly Hills Cop superstar ' s wish should , would , and must be fulfilled ." Sure , if the right project came along , I would love to get behind the camera , " Mr Reiser said in a most fascinating interview on the TV Guide Network , his statement receiving the kind of soaring public ovation typically reserved for baseball stars Derek Jeter , Roger " The Rocket " Clemens , and world renowned badminton legend Lin Dan . " Right now I ' m really focused on my family , but I ' m always up for new professional challenges . "" I am the best , " Reiser added .Mr Reiser has previously delighted viewers in America and in other superior regions of the world with his much adored Mad About You , a 30 minute comedy program that won the Golden Globe Award and passed the fair and honorable requirements of the State Council of the People ' s Republic of China . All this Mr Reiser accomplished while gracefully shouldering the burden of his costar and clear unequal Helen Hunt .It is the opinion of everyone that Mrs Hunt is inferior in every way to Mr Reiser and would be nothing if not for his great benevolence toward those far below his station .Mr Reiser ' s books Couplehood and Babyhood were excellent additions to both the Eastern and Western literary canons , and their lessons should be adhered to . 	 1
For 99 of RPG players , the story is the same : obtaining quests , journeying into the unknown , completing extraordinarily mundane tasks , slaying any jerks along the way , gaining experience points to level up and having nerd conversations with the only friends you have , online . For some , however , this concept is not so simple , like the Dalai Lama who seems to have gotten it backwards .A couple of weeks ago , the Dalai Lama changed the face of Azeroth , the world in World of Warcraft . Armed with a walking stick , boots of the shining and rags of a commoner , the Dalai Lama ' s World of Warcraft character , a level 1 paladin , walked up to a band of computer controlled orcs . In an effort to show solidarity with the other race , the character immediately unequipped his stick and typed , " Hello , " into the World of Warcraft server , hoping the orcs would respond with their own respective " Hello " grunt . Little did the Dalai Lama realize these computer controlled orcs have no way of reciprocating and were pre programmed to attack any non orc race , even if that race believed in world peace .The entire incident was witnessed by a group of newbie rogues who were watching from behind the bushes as they did not want to interfere because they were newbies .It is rumored that none of the Dalai Lama ' s characters have made it passed level 1 . Back in August , he created a Dwarven priest class , but he soon dumped it in shame after accidentally punching a rival player . Then in September , he created an Elven warlock class , which he soon realized had the word ' war ' in it so he deleted the character . The paladin is his longest lasting character he created it in early October , but still has not managed to gain any experience points .His paladin ' s death has inspired a great following . After the Dalai ' s character re spawned , characters from across the world began to follow him on his journey to make peace in Azeroth . " We protect him , " said a real AzN gamer . " If the Dalai Lama gets into trouble we use the glyph of warding spell to block off all attacks on him . Then we just kill them all . He doesn ' t agree with it but he ' s too passive to stop us . We love him and we ' ll keep fighting for him . "The makers of the game , Blizzard , have questioned the Dalai Lama ' s motives . " The Lama is going against all that we ' ve built for the last several years ! " said lead designer of the game , Tom Chilton . " The addiction of killing your inferiors and leveling up is what keeps gamers coming back , but this Ghandi idiot comes along and ruins it ! We are looking into legal ways to cancel his account for breaking the unspoken rules of WoW ! "When asked how he feels about being slighted by Blizzard , the Dalai Lama ignored the question and said , " I can ' t wait for the expansion pack ! They are adding a new monk class ! " 	 1
BOSTON Truck driver and banjo player Jay " Snapbean " Holcomb was named a " person of interest " by Boston police Tuesday in its investigation of a series of unannounced and boisterous hootenannies responsible for bringing sections of the city to a virtual standstill over the past several weeks ." Just a few minutes ago , I was on my way to Jamba Juice when I heard a high lonesome voice yodel ' Hey y ' all ! ' " said Credit Suisse Boston vice president of asset management Stanley Hedges , who reported that his firm has lost more than a thousand man hours to Holcomb ' s random acts of old time quick steppin ' . " Then he started that old banjo to sing you could hear it talk , you could hear it ring . And as I felt myself start to do si do , all I could think was , Not again . "Holcomb , 42 , known far and wide for his vigorous rolling style of picking and his good timey , fast tempo breakdowns , matches a description given by hundreds of eyewitnesses of an upbeat , banjo toting , vest sporting man with a clawhammer style that he must have learned from the Devil himself .Authorities said that Tuesday ' s barn burner claimed over 300 roisterers . Although no actual barns were burned , victims of Holcomb ' s impromptu celebrations say they are ill timed and disruptive ." These constant hootenannings must stop , " said Mayor Thomas Menino , an outspoken critic since the front doors of historic Faneuil Hall were taken off their hinges and laid in the street to provide a dancing surface during a particularly spirited jamboree three weeks ago . " They ' re fine once in a while , like when the city brings in a record harvest , or when the schoolmarm agrees to marry Ol ' Doc Blanchett . But a high steppin ' weekday ruckus is unbefittin ' to a big , important county seat like Boston , and as mayor , I won ' t stand for these fool shenanigans . "Though the spontaneous acts of bluegrass have been characterized as " hell raisin ' , " they have yet to cause significant injury , aside from damage inflicted on numerous brooms and washtubs converted into bass fiddles , and dozens of pairs of spoons bent while being repurposed as percussive aids . In addition , several clotheslines in the Beacon Hill neighborhood were trodden under by escaped hogs , at least one of which wound up wearing an area resident ' s best Sunday dress while Bostonians chased it through the already chaotic downtown traffic .Despite the relatively harmless fun , many peace loving residents now live in fear of being swept up in the exhausting yet irresistible revels ." I was already late for work last Monday morning when that smiling fellow started that hootenanny on Boston Common , " stockbroker Sid Daley said . " It ' s one thing when infectious banjo music compels you to grab the nearest washboard or empty jug and join along on a Friday night or a Saturday afternoon , but on a Monday morning , when I have meetings ? There ' s a time and a place for letting this kind of deal go down , is all I ' m saying . "Holcomb , born and raised in the hill country of Somerville , reportedly has a history of salty dog like behavior , beginning in his youth , when he was often reprimanded at school for rowdy folk music related behavior . By the time he was 18 , Holcomb had joined a local gang of bluegrass boys , and started acting on his pathological hootennanish impulses ." We think Mr Holcomb fits the profile of a hootenanny ringleader and has the skills to pull off something even bigger , " Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said . " Wingdings , shindigs , pig pickin ' s we ' re sure he ' s capable of those , too . He may enlist the help of other banjoists , perhaps even fiddle players , and throw a full blown hoedown . "" I do declare , " added Davis , removing his hat and wiping his brow . " The people of Boston have to be prepared for the absolute gol durndest . " 	 1
Warriors ' Klay Thompson says sprained ankle at 70 percentGolden State Warriors All Star shooting guard Klay Thompson will be a game time decision for Friday night ' s contest against the Boston Celtics due to a sprained ankle .Thompson was injured in the final minute of Tuesday ' s 131 123 victory over the Indiana Pacers , which improved the Warriors ' record to 23 0 ." It ' s not feeling great , but it ' s not feeling bad , " Thompson said after Thursday ' s practice at Emerson College in Boston . " It ' s like somewhere in between . It ' s like 60 percent nah , 70 . "Thompson , who finished with a season high 39 points against the Pacers , was walking under his own power with a bit of a limp after the game , though the team said X rays were negative . He has been rehabbing the injury since ." He ' s obviously out there getting some shots up , shooting around , but it ' ll likely be a game time decision against Boston , " Warriors interim head coach Luke Walton said . " If there ' s any concern at all that his ankle ' s hurt , then we ' re not going to play him . "When asked for his prognosis , Thompson said : " I ' m optimistic about life and Friday . And , yeah I ' m optimistic . I think if I have a good shootaround on Friday , I ' ll play . "Thompson indicated that the decision to play against the Celtics is complicated by the Warriors playing the Milwaukee Bucks on a back to back Saturday ." It is the team ' s call , and if it ' s not 100 percent Friday , I might have to sit out because we have such a quick turnaround , " Thompson said . " I want to finish the trip on a high note in Milwaukee . "Thompson has recently rehabbed back soreness that plagued him earlier in the season ." I had no back pain for the last couple weeks , and it feels great , " he said .Of the newer ankle injury , Thompson said : ? " It ' s just a very minor set back . I won ' t be out very long . " 	 0
Pearly Gate , Celestial City , Heaven Yesterday , Sister Mary Jo , resident here these past 40 years since she drowned in an auto " accident " , received a surprise visitor .A former Congressman , who for legal reasons will remain nameless , was given a day pass from Hell by none other than Satan himself ." We would have granted that day pass sooner " , said Prince of Darkness Satan , " but the Congressman had so many friends to catch up with down here that there hasn ' t been time . "Heavenly insiders are surprised and touched by Satan ' s actions , not the Congressman ' s . " Heck , we know this wasn ' t that guy ' s idea . " , said St . Peter , " Frankly , I already heard all about how Beelzebub and three other fallen angels had to drag him kicking and screaming up here . But for Satan to do this for Sister Mary Jo wow , now that ' s the Lucifer that we used to know and love ! "A source in Hell , speaking on conditions of anonymity had this to say : " This doesn ' t mean the war is over , not by a long shot . But now and then , even Satan can ' t stomach some of the things his minions do . And for that guy to have been so fondly remembered by the other humans well , that ' s good I guess , but sometimes our successes make us kind of queasy . "Sister Mary Jo received the Congressman in as kind a fashion as heaven ' s residents have come to expect of her . She listened without so much as a raised eyebrow to explanations of not seeing fire departments or aid stations as he fled the scene , and his need to rest for 24 hours before getting help . She didn ' t flinch at his " mistakes may have been made " half apology , half defense .A reliable source close to the Throne of God reports that allowing this at all was more to bring about a healing between Jehovah and Lucifer , as it ' s believed the visitor is entirely without hope of redemption . 	 1
Indiana Gov . Mike Pence ( R ) , who gained national notoriety by demanding people of faith must be able to follow the dictates of their conscience , recently urged the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Indiana to stop following the dictates of its conscience . It turns out , that didn t go well .The Republican governor met with church officials last week , made his case against the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in Indiana , and asked the Archdiocese not to assist a struggling family fleeing violence . The local Archbishop listened to Pence s concerns , before deciding to ignore him .Catholic Charities moved forward with its plans to settle Syrian refugees in the state on Monday , despite calls from Gov . Mike Pence ( R ) to keep refugees from Syria out of the state , the Indianapolis Star reported .Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph W . Tobin announced in a Tuesday statement that the family arrived in Indianapolis on Monday night .Note , the Syrian family in question has already undergone two years of screening and security checks , and also already has family members living in Indianapolis . Pence not only hoped to block the family , he also hoped the Catholic Church would follow his lead .Looking ahead , the Republican governor could intensify his efforts , but the Indianapolis Star reports that Pence appears to be retreating .Gov . Mike Pence said Tuesday he will not block a Syrian refugee family from receiving state aid such as food stamps and health care , even as he continues to oppose its relocation to Indiana .Now that the Syrian family is here , Pence could have directed state agencies to deny the family food stamps and health care , but it would have been a path almost certain to draw legal challenges given such benefits are offered to people from other countries . On that issue , Pence said : I have no intention of interfering with the ordinary administration of state government relative to people who are legally within the state of Indiana .The governor , incidentally , is up for re election next year . Some polling from earlier this year suggests the race could be competitive , despite the Republican Party s traditional dominance in Indiana . 	 0
Arrests in Chicago , NY at protests over police shootingsCHICAGO : Multiple arrests were made overnight in Chicago and New York during protests over police shootings of two black males , US media reported .In Chicago , several people were arrested after protesters began taking lights off a Christmas tree in Millennium Park , local NBC affiliate WMAQ reported .The broadcaster said authorities did not say how many arrests were made , but newspaper USA Today said two protesters had been detained as of 10 : 30 pm Wednesday ( 0430 GMT Thursday ) .CNN reported that some 100 to 200 demonstrators were still walking through downtown streets before dawn Thursday following a second night of protests .Racial tensions flared in Chicago after officials released a graphic video Tuesday of a police officer shooting a black teen 16 times .The dashcam video , shot in October 2014 from an approaching cruiser , shows officer Jason Van Dyke open fire on Laquan McDonald , 17 .The Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday that it had obtained the video from four other police vehicles , including Van Dyke s , following an open record request to Mayor Rahm Emanuel .Police in New York said protesters rallying against the same shooting had entered the Macy s department store at Herald Square and also tried blocking the Lincoln Tunnel at one point , according to local CBS affiliate WCBS .CNN reported that several people had been arrested while WCBS said that six had been detained by late Wednesday on disorderly conduct charges .The New York demonstrators were also rallying against a recent incident in Minneapolis in which five people were shot during a Black Lives Matter protest .The five were part of a crowd demonstrating against the fatal police shooting of Jamal Clark , 24 .Police say Clark died in a struggle with officers on November 15 but witnesses say he was handcuffed at the time .Four people remain in custody over the Black Lives Matter shooting , Minneapolis police said . 	 0
London Two imprisoned comedic actors escaped today amid the confusion of the summer Olympics . The two Americans , actors Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder , had been imprisoned in Buckingham Palace over two decades ago by Prince William , who lovingly ordered then held after viewing them in the movie Stir Crazy .Prince William , it must be told , has a highly developed sense of humor , more so than the average commoner , and begged his mother , Her Royal Highness , to hold the actors as his " royal guests " , apparently with such vigor and determination that Her Majesty finally gave in just to shut him up .William , it was rumored , converted an upstairs bedroom in the palace into an exact duplicate of the tiny prison cell featured in the movie , where the unfortunate actors had been held all these years .However , it was said by other royal family members that both Pryor and Wilder were none to happy about being imprisoned , even if was in a palace , and refused to reenact their hilarious scenes from the movie for the Prince , who , despite begging and begging and begging , couldn ' t persuade the unruly Americans to comply .Prince William sadly announced that it was during the Olympic rodeo bull riding contest , which both actors volunteered to enter , that they made their escape today .London Police detective James Smitemore said the prince begged and begged the Police Department to search for the pair , saying " I want my chums back " , and so the police finally gave in just to shut him upDetective Smitemore described the fugitive Richard Pryor as " a short son of a bitch , his daddy was a short son of a bitch , his mother was shorter than him , and his brother , his brother was so short you couldn ' t even see him .

Fort Meade , Maryland A military prosecutor said Bradley Manning acted as a " determined insider " in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and should be locked up for 60 years at least , but the Army private ' s lawyer contended he can be rehabilitated and should not " rot in jail . "The two sides delivered their final sentencing arguments to Col . Denise Lind , the judge who convicted Manning at trial and will now determine his punishment .He faces up to 90 years behind bars for the largest leak of classified information in U . S . history ." There may not be a soldier in the history of the Army who displayed such an extreme disregard " for his mission as a soldier , Capt . Joe Morrow , the prosecutor , said .His arrogance , according Morrow , meant he " felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified . "Morrow asked that Manning , 25 , serve a minimum sentence of six decades behind bars , saying his actions created grave risk , disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives .Defense attorney David Coombs did not ask for a specific sentence , but said his client was an excellent candidate for rehabilitation , and that he should not be left to " rot in jail . "" Perhaps his biggest crime was that he cared about the loss of life that he was seeing and couldn ' t ignore it . " Coombs said of Manning ' s decision to turn over the explosive information to WikiLeaks ." This is a young man capable of being redeemed , " Coombs said in final remarks . " The defense requests , after the court considers all the facts , a sentence that allows him to have a life . "Lind recessed the proceedings until Tuesday morning but it is not clear when she will render a decision .Manning was convicted of numerous counts in July , including espionage related charges . He avoided a potential life sentence when Lind rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy .In addition to prison , prosecutors also want Manning to forfeit pay and benefits and pay a 100 , 000 fine .Officials indicated a single sentence would cover all of the guilty counts . 	 0
China s accession to the International Monetary Fund s elite has left behind India , whose cautious approach to liberalisation means the Indian rupee is unlikely to be a viable candidate for reserve currency status for at least a decade .China has campaigned hard for inclusion in the benchmark currency basket , and the IMF s announcement on Monday that the yuan had been added was recognition of its global power status .Beijing has introduced a flurry reforms to ensure the yuan was considered freely usable in IMF parlance , meaning widely used in international transactions and commonly traded .Indian government also harbours ambitions to increase the country s clout on the international stage and to extend the reach of its currency , freeing up investment and trade .After all , in 1980 , India was an economy roughly the same size as China . Now China is more than four and a half times larger .But concerns over broader economic stability in India mean there is little appetite for big bang currency reforms , even among top central bank officials who have argued for full convertibility over time , like governor Raghuram Rajan .That means India could , by some estimates , be over a decade away from following China .Our estimates suggest that India s GDP will still only be around 6 trillion in 2027 , i . e . still not as big as China today , and by then world GDP will be still larger , said Charles Robertson , global chief economist at Renaissance Capital .So unless politics plays a role , we doubt India s rupee will be a global reserve currency before 2030 .Rajan , answering questions on the IMF s yuan move , said on Tuesday that India was moving in the right direction .We are steadily moving towards being a much more open economy , while keeping some of the concerns about stability , making sure we have things broadly under control , he said .He detailed steps taken by the Reserve Bank of India towards a freer rupee : allowing companies to more easily raise rupee debt offshore , with masala bonds , and allowing foreign investors to invest more in rupee debt onshore , for example .All these ( steps ) are in the direction to broaden and open up a little more , but at the same time it is not a big bang , where we lose control , he said . It is a steady process .Post getting in , pressure may not be as much as before going in , he said in an interview with CNBC TV18 .Since India began opening up its economy in 1991 , it has gone from a largely non convertible , pegged currency to a regime that is effectively a managed float , meaning there is a currency market , but the RBI intervenes to contain volatility .Under Rajan , a former chief economist at the IMF , the central bank has steadily acted to open up Indian markets .On Monday , it eased rules for offshore borrowing , allowing foreign insurers , pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to lend to Indian corporates more easily , and for longer .That is basically capital account liberalisation , which is being done in a prudent and pragmatic manner and becoming more rules based , said Rahul Bajoria , regional economist at Barclays . That is a very good signal .But with major structural reforms to push through to make India competitive on a global scale , analysts and economists said there was little expectation India could catch up quickly with over a decade of reform in China .China started liberalising since 2005 , so it has taken them about 12 13 years , said Bajoria , pointing to major market and currency reforms .From that perspective we still have a long way to go .According to payment services provider Swift , in September the yuan was fifth in the ranking of currencies used for international payments .The rupee is not ranked in the top 20 , a list that ends with Hungary s forint , the currency of a country with a population 1 125th the size of India s .First Published on December 01 , 2015 9 : 59 pm 	 0

new york standing mystified in a crowded intersection, verus attius glabrio, a roman centurion who emerged from a manhole in the middle of new york's time square, is in for a wacky adventure, sources confirmed wednesday. reports stated that glabrio, a highly decorated military officer from 55 a. d., crawled out of the sewer opening at approximately 8 : 35 p. m. clad in full roman imperial battle armor, immediately causing motorists to swerve, slam on their brakes, scream vulgar remarks, and make obscene hand gestures in his direction. " halt, yellow beast! " said glabrio, drawing his sword and advancing toward a honking taxi cab that skidded to a stop as angry drivers and stunned passersby urged the roman centurion to " get outta the road " and " go back to little italy, julius! " " you shan't pass this way, lest you decide to face me. and let me warn you, you great golden demon, i'm certainly not a foe you want to face today! " " but lo, what is this behemoth? " added glabrio, appearing visibly panicked upon sighting an approaching tractor trailer. " it is the son of jupiter himself! " after finding his way to the busy sidewalk, the centurion, who mere moments earlier hit his head against a rock during intense hand to hand combat against a rival corsican general, reportedly stared up dumbfounded at the flashing neon lights and video billboards. sources stated that the roman soldier then recoiled in fear as stock numbers scrolled across the lighted nasdaq ticker, causing him to raise his shield and cry out, " beware, some manner of numeral serpent comes this way! " according to eyewitness accounts, the roman soldier spent the next several minutes asking uncooperative passersby for directions to corsica, stressing that he needed to return to finish the great war and secure victory for the empire. despite his best efforts, however, glabrio reportedly garnered little attention from anyone aside from a family of tourists who posed for a photo with the baffled roman infantry commander in front of m m's world, and an 8 year old boy who looked up, mouth agape, from the spartan themed comic book he was reading. several reports indicated that pedestrians gave a wide berth to the sword wielding roman centurion and made exasperated remarks such as " oh great, another weirdo " and " only in new york. " " will someone anyone assist me in my journey? " said glabrio, grabbing at various pedestrians wearing headphones and pushing baby strollers, every one of whom shrunk away from him or told him to " buzz off " as they played their brief roles in the soldier's unpredictable and zany narrative. " come now, citizens of this strange land! i have two denarii for anyone willing to assist me! " " if you cannot accompany me, won't someone at least tell me where i may find this man surely he must be your leader, " glabrio then added, gesturing to a giant billboard ad featuring an image of puff daddy. after he was seen very tentatively stepping into a subway train, the centurion was reportedly later spotted at the metropolitan museum of art, growing wide eyed upon glimpsing the marble busts of political figures he claimed to know personally while passing through the museum's greek and roman art exhibit. according to sources, glabrio became involved in a heated altercation with two security guards after he attempted to pick up several of the " clearly looted imperial riches " and vowed to return them to rome. the situation, onlookers told reporters, was defused when rebecca huntley, a meek doctoral student of european history who would unwittingly find her own life turned upside down by this unusual yet strangely attractive man, intervened on the roman centurion's behalf, explaining that he was not from around here and discouraging museum workers from calling the police. " please, my lady, surely you can be of service my men need my aid, " said glabrio, talking to the taken aback but also captivated young woman, who according to reports will attempt to help the centurion fit into his new surroundings by dressing him in her ex fianc's undersized tuxedo for an upcoming cocktail party. " if you don't know the way to corsica then just usher me to the imperial stables where i may find a steed and you can be on your way. " " wait, step back, my lady, i will protect you! " glabrio then shouted before leaping and tackling a life size statue of a lion. the roman centurion and huntley reportedly spent the rest of the evening bonding over several slices of pizza, a glass of wine glabrio 	 1
A neo Nazi dad who named his son Adolf Hitler has said he ' ll continue to have kids if child welfare services keep taking his after another child , Eva Braun , was taken two days after she was born .Heath Campbell , 40 , a father of nine who first hit headlines after a bakery refused to ice his son ' s Nazi inspired name on a birthday cake , has demanded welfare services hand back his daughter .Campbell ' s fiance , 22 year old Bethanie Zito , gave birth to the little girl in a Pennsylvania hospital on November 11 and the couple named her after Hitler ' s long term companion .After two days , the baby was taken into care by child services .Demands : Heath Campbell , with his fiancee Stephanie Zito , said he will continue to have children if child welfare services continue to take his away .

marjah, afghanistan the nato operation aimed at tackling a taliban stronghold in southern afghanistan is making progress, officials say. he said the marines had bypassed several lines of roadside bombs and were in the process of clearing the city " from the inside out. " watch marines in action in marjahthe taliban is " popping up in various parts of the city, " abawi said. " we went just a couple hundred meters outside of the position that we're usually based in we were under gunfire ourselves. " marjah is " practically a ghost town right now, " she added. " you can't really find out where they're hiding.... they can be anywhere. " abawi said nato forces are hoping to draw more " extremist fighters " out of their hiding places and into combat. between two and three insurgents are being killed in each clash on average, she said, and nato commanders " don't expect fighting to die down anytime soon. " combined forces have been " conducting a number of mounted and dismounted patrols, " according to a news release from the international security assistance force. " elements of the combined force have been engaged in periodic small arms fire fights, and a number of insurgents have been either killed or detained, " isaf said. the release noted that the combined force " has sustained some injuries. " troops recovered 8. 7 million worth of raw opium, abawi reported. clearing out poppy fields is a key part of operation moshtarak, the biggest offensive since the afghan war started in 2001. the taliban finances its activities in part through the illegal opium trade. the operation in helmand province focuses on marjah and surrounding areas. marjah, known as the country's heroin capital, is where the taliban set up a shadow government. the city is now the " last bastion " for the taliban in the helmand river valley, dietz said. one of the biggest challenges facing the nato mission is attacking the taliban while limiting civilian casualties. on sunday, 12 civilians died in a rocket attack by coalition troops. isaf first issued a statement saying the civilians were killed when a rocket hit about 600 meters ( 650 yards ) from its intended target. a senior isaf official, however, later said the rocket was not off target at all. the official said troops hit the building they were aiming for but did not know that civilians were inside. the official has direct knowledge of the incident, but he declined to be named because an investigation is under way. " it's regrettable that in the course of our joint efforts, innocent lives were lost, " u. s. gen. stanley mcchrystal, top commander of u. s. forces in afghanistan, said in a statement sunday. mcchrystal has given troops clear orders to avoid civilian casualties. " even if there is a taliban fighter within a compound and troops suspect that a civilian is in there, they are not allowed to fire, " abawi reported. a group of afghan villagers came to the marines with two wounded teenage boys. the military treated them and sent them by medevac to the nearest hospital. villagers told the troops that the taliban were using private homes to fire at u. s. forces. in an incident not connected to operation moshtarak, an airstrike by nato forces accidentally killed five afghan civilians and wounded two monday in afghanistan, the military said. a joint afghan isaf patrol in kandahar province observed a group of people who seemed to be burying an improvised explosive device, isaf said. the patrol called in an airstrike, but later found out that the group was not planting an ied. " we regret this tragic accident and offer our sympathies to the families of those killed and injured, " maj. gen. michael regner, isaf joint command deputy chief of staff, said in the isaf statement. about 15, 000 afghan and nato forces are taking part in operation moshtarak. u. s. troops are leading the mission. " the majority of the fighting, the majority of the headway being made, is by the u. s. forces, " abawi reported. she added that she had seen many afghan soldiers " and to be quite honest with you, they're not ready to fight. " more on operation moshtarak from afghanistan crossroads blogin a statement monday, master sgt. jeff loftin, a spokesman for the nato led international security assistance force, said forces were in the " clearing phase. " afghan and nato troops discovered 5, 500 pounds of explosives and seized a taliban commander responsible for small arms ambushes and roadside attacks on troops, loftin said. forces were facing primarily small arms fire, he said. several insurgents have been killed or detained and some coalition troop members have suffered injuries. loftin did not specify the number of militants and troops wounded or killed. over the weekend, provincial spokesman dawoud 	 0
World number one Rafael Nadal battled back from a set down to finally topple American Andy Roddick in an epic clash at the ATP World Tour finals .The Spaniard looked out of sorts in the opening set but slowly returned to form as the game progressed to secure a 3 6 7 6 6 4 victory in two hours 30 minutes .After a near five week break from the game due to injury , Nadal was rusty during the opening set and lost his opening service game as Roddick opened up a 3 0 lead .Nadal struggled to recover from his slovenly start and Roddick held his serve to close out the first set 6 3 in just 49 minutes .The second set saw Nadal broken again early on but the Spaniard finally made inroads into Roddick ' s booming serve to square the set at 2 2 .After that both players held firm on serve before Nadal took the tie break and his first set at the O2 Arena in London .The deciding set went with serve until the sixth game when a passing winner handed Nadal a precious break .

ALBUQUERQUE , NM Investigators are trying to determine what led an unborn child to fatally shoot his twin with a . 38 caliber revolver during an altercation in their shared Albuquerque womb Monday .According to police , the twins ' mother , Evelyn Alpert , 34 , was awakened at 4 a . m . by the sensation of a scuffle in her uterus , which she dismissed as " routine kicking . " Approximately 30 minutes later , Alpert heard and felt three pistol shots .A subsequent forensic ultrasound revealed that the unborn gunman identified as a five inch tall male Caucasian of slight build with no eyes or hair shot his brother twice in what eventually would have become his heart .After a tense four hour standoff , the unborn gunman threw out his weapon when police threatened to induce labor . Police spokesmen have denied that the use of tear gas or forced C section was ever considered . Alpert was unharmed in the shooting , with two of the bullets lodging themselves in the victim and the third passing harmlessly through the birth canal .The shooter has yet to emerge from the crime scene , but a court appointed lawyer has said that the fetus will surrender himself peacefully upon his post partum separation from Alpert sometime in early October ." This whole tragic chain of events is hard to comprehend , " Albuquerque mayor Jim Baca said . " Where did we as a community fail these unborn boys ? Could their parents have done a better job of conceiving , carrying , and pre natally educating them ? And how did the fetus get access to firearms ? "Police officials say the shooter used a revolver registered to his father , Lee Alpert , who may have left the firearm within reach of his wife ' s womb . No charges have been filed against the man at press time .According to Albuquerque D . A . Eugene Billups , though the assailant is legally recognized as a fetus , he will be tried as an infant . Pretrial hearings begin next week , and ultrasound technicians will not be allowed in the courtroom ." This is hard to take , " Billups told reporters . " These kids were no more than babies . "Offering the Alpert family " my deepest sympathy and support in this difficult time , " President Clinton said he is redoubling his efforts to pass tougher obstetric gun control legislation ." Last year , I called upon Congress to require trigger locks on handguns and place metal detectors at the entrance of every womb , " Clinton said at a White House press conference . " Such laws may well have saved the life of that unborn child . I now ask Congress to do the right thing and pass that legislation , as well as a measure extending the waiting period for firearms beyond nine months . We must keep handguns out of the unformed hands of our nation ' s fetuses . "The fetus , following the advice of his attorney , has offered no comment on the shooting . 	 1
LA BREA The most recent American Idol castoff Haley Reinhart was having dinner by herself at a Burgers In The Round in La Brea .She was approached by TV ClickerWorld ' s Grandiosa Littlehampton and asked how she was doing after having been eliminated and ending up in third place .Haley , put down her double cheeseburger and told Grandy that at first she kind of took it all in stride and realized that it was just meant to be .The Illinois songstress took a sip of her Diet Dr Pepper fountain drink and continued by saying that now she is truly upset and she blames the fact that she did not make the finals on two of the three friggin judges .Littlehampton finished a French fry and remarked , " Jackson and Lopez . "Haley got a big grin on her face , and softly bit her lower lip with her upper teeth and replied " Bingo ! "She went on to say that the third judge Steven Tyler was great and that from the very beginning he supported her even one time lending her 10 so that she could buy some pantyhose .But then Reinhart turned her attention towards Randy " The Black Dawg " Jackson and Jennifer " La Tush " Lopez and she got a look of vampirical evil in her eyes .She said that " The Black Dawg " has a tendency of saying one thing but then turning around and saying totally the opposite thing the next time .Haley said that Randy is also the biggest name dropper in Hollywood always bragging that he worked with Beyonce , Celine Dion , Whitney Houston , Elvis Presley , Nancy Sinatra , and the Beatles .She then said that as for J . Lo she does a great job of covering up all of her blemishes , freckles , and cellulite .Reinhart said that one time she accidentally saw Jennifer totally nude and she ( Lopez ) sat her down and made her sign a paper stating that she would never reveal to anyone that she had seen her totally naked .Haley said that J . Lo paid her 75 and gave her a free autographed CD .Littlehampton then addressed the rumor that everyone was saying that she and fellow contestant Casey " Mr Stand Up Bass " Abrams had run off to Las Vegas and eloped .Reinhart blushed . She spilled some ketchup on her blue jean Daisy Duke short shorts and giggled a little bit .After she regained her composure she whispered to Grandy that it was not true . She said that there is just no way that her and Casey can hide the fact that they are so attracted to each other but she said that they will not be doing the ' Do ' until they both officially say , " I do . "Grandy asked , " So you ' re telling me that you and Casey have not as yet vavavoomed ?Haley smiled and nodded that they are vavavoomless .Both Haley and Casey are hoping to get into the recording studio some time soon and record a CD that will showcase Haley ' s sultry growling voice and Casey ' s out of control screaming voice . She giggled and said that they have even agreed on the CDs title , ' The Young Yellers of American Idol . 'In other news .

Researchers have claimed a major breakthrough in the fight against obesity and say they have found a genetic switch that controls our metabolism .Researchers have identified a protein that controls metabolism and used it to dramatically reduce the development of obesity and diabetes in mice .By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies cells ' energy burning abilities , researchers say they could now develop new weight loss therapies .By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies how we burn energy , researchers say they could now develop radical new weight loss therapies .The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N methyltransferase ( NNMT ) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice .NNMT is known to process vitamin B3 and has been previously linked with certain types of cancers .The new process hinges on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy .This is what allows some people to eat as much as they want , but never put on weight .Investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) published their research in the April 10 issue of the journal Nature .The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N methyltransferase ( NNMT ) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice .' With this discovery , we now have a means of metabolic manipulation that could help speed energy production and lead to weight loss , ' said senior author Barbara Kahn .The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy .' We all know people who can seemingly eat whatever they want and not gain weight , ' explains Kahn .' Part of the reason for this natural weight control owes to basal cellular metabolism the body ' s inherent rate of burning energy .' A futile cycle is one way to speed up energy utilization in cells . 'The breakthrough also used a technique already used to treat other diseases in humans , raising hopes it could be available soon .' Our findings are particularly exciting because the antisense oligonucleotide ASO technology we used to inhibit the NNMT gene in our study is already being used to treat other diseases in humans , ' said Dr Kahn .The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy and allows some people to eat as much as they want without getting fat .More than one third of the U . S . adult population is currently obese , according to the U . S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .' Obesity is a serious economic burden to our healthcare system and a major risk factor for developing insulin resistance and diabetes , ' says Dr Kahn .NNMT is an enzyme that processes vitamin B3 and has been linked to certain types of cancer , as well as Alzheimer ' s disease , said co corresponding author Qin Yang , MD , PhD , a Klarman Scholar in the Kahn laboratory at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School .' Now we have identified an entirely new role for this enzyme in fat tissue , and that is to regulate energy metabolism , ' he said .The investigators first confirmed that levels of NNMT were increased in obese and diabetic mice .' In a comparison of genetic profiles of fat from mice that were either prone to or protected from developing diabetes , we discovered that the animals that were prone to develop diabetes had a lot of NNMT in the fat and liver , ' said Yang .The team discovered that NNMT inhibition speeds up the so called futile cycle , resulting in more dietary calories being burned for energy and fewer calories being incorporated into fat .Importantly , notes Kahn , the team used antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO ) technology to knock down the NNMT gene .' Because ASOs have already been approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of genetic causes of elevated cholesterol or hyperlipidemia , as well as the treatment of a viral eye infection , it ' s possible that clinical trials to test an ASO anti obesity therapy in humans could readily move forward .' NNMT looks to be a promising target for future therapeutic development .' Furthermore , because obesity is associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer ' s disease and certain cancers , disease states in which NNMT is also elevated , an NNMT ASO could potentially also be beneficial in managing these other devastating conditions .

Regardless of who is carrying the ball , the Texans should focus the direction of their running game behind left tackle Duane Brown .Through seven games this season , the Texans are averaging 4 . 9 yards per carry running behind their left tackle , but they have averaged less than four yards per carry in every other direction .The majority of the Texans ' rush attempts this season have gone toward the middle left and middle right , between the center and either guard , but runs in those directions have gone for just 3 . 5 and 2 . 9 yards per carry , respectively .Ben Jones has done a decent job in pass blocking this year , but he ? ranks 25th among centers in the run block rating from Pro Football Focus , so trying to jam running plays up the middle probably isn ' t the best strategy .During that Week 3 win against Tampa Bay when Blue had a great game , he picked up 57 yards on 13 carries on his combined runs around the left end and toward the left tackle . From that same game , Blue also picked up 40 yards on seven carries around the right end and toward the right tackle .Blue had a combined average of 4 . 85 yards per carry on 20 attempts around either end or toward either tackle but averaged 3 . 81 yards per carry on 11 attempts up the middle toward the two guards or center against Tampa Bay .That ' s a very small sample size , but running toward Brown more often than Jones seems like a solid strategy .Their opponent this week , the Tennessee Titans , ? ranks 30th , 22nd and 26th , respectively , in rushing yards , rushing touchdowns and yards per carry allowed this season , so leaning on the running game should yield positive results for the Texans even without Foster available .The Texans just made Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill look like a Hall of Famer , so nothing is a guarantee with this team , but facing Zach Mettenberger instead of Marcus Mariota is a better matchup for them this week .Besides reading recognizing screen plays and tackling in the secondary , one of the biggest issues the Texans defense has had this season is keeping the quarterback contained .Their team pass rush hasn ' t been good this year , but they ' ve had several plays per game that would have turned into sacks where a player broke free in the backfield , but the edge players on the other side lost contain and allowed the quarterback to leave the pocket , avoid the pressure and get rid of the football .Mettenberger has a big arm , but he runs like a refrigerator , so losing contain on him isn ' t one percent of the concern that it would be if they were facing a great athlete such as ? Mariota .The second year quarterback from LSU has natural physical talent but was inconsistent last year and might provide the Texans defense with a chance for a " get right " game this week .Last year , ? Mettenberger ranked 32nd in the league in the accuracy percentage , according to ? Pro Football Focus , which factors in passes thrown away , spikes and dropped passes .In his first and only start so far this season , Mettenberger was held to under 200 yards passing with one touchdown and two interceptions against the Atlanta Falcons last week . Mettenberger ranked 27th out of 28 quarterbacks last week in the overall rating from Pro Football Focus unfortunately , Brian Hoyer ranked 26th .The worst thing the Texans could do this week would be to give Mettenberger easy throws by playing off coverage or blitzing too much . They need to get up on the Titans receivers , drop seven or eight into coverage and wait for Mettenberger to make a mistake .The Titans rank 27th in sacks allowed , so rushing just the normal four , with J . J . Watt and Jadeveon Clowney leading the way , should be good enough to get pressure on Mettenberger .The Baylor product caught 94 passes for 1 , 079 yards in 2013 and is currently averaging a career best 13 . 4 yards per reception this year .Wright ' s highest yards per game average against any team he ' s played more than once during his career also happens to be against Houston . In his last two games against the Texans , Wright has a combined 14 receptions for 186 yards and two touchdowns . 	 0
SALT LAKE CITY , UT Olympic bobsledders Jean Racine and Gea Johnson have two major goals for the Salt Lake City Games . The first is to win the gold medal . The second is to let young girls know that they , too , can pursue their bobsled dreams ." When I was growing up , little girls were encouraged to participate in sports like tennis and basketball , but never bobsledding , " said Racine , 23 , driver of the American women ' s two person sled . " Well , I want that to change that for the next generation . I want to be the person today ' s young girls can look to and say to themselves , ' Hey , I can bobsled if I want to . ' "" One day , " Racine continued , " people will see women bobsledders as bobsledders first and women second . "Johnson , the team ' s brakewoman , echoed Racine ' s sentiments ." There has always been this assumption and I don ' t know where it comes from that girls aren ' t interested in bobsledding , " the 34 year old Johnson said . " I can remember , as a third grader , telling my gym teacher that when I grew up , I wanted to be a bobsledder . He said , ' Why would you want to do that ? ' "Salt Lake City 2002 is the first Olympics to feature women ' s bobsledding as a medal event . As thrilled as Racine and Johnson would be to win that first ever gold , just having the chance to serve as role models for the female bobsledders of tomorrow means as much to them ." We have to be worthy ambassadors of bobsledding , " Racine said . " We have to represent the sport well and be the kind of bobsledders today ' s young girls can aspire to be like . That ' s a heavy responsibility , but I feel up to the task . "Johnson said parents can play a vital role in opening up the bobsled doors for their daughters ." Usually , parents let their little girls sled until they ' re a certain age , and then it ' s suddenly discouraged , " Johnson said . " Boys can go on and become bobsledders , and that ' s okay with everyone . We have to let our girls know that there ' s nothing wrong with wanting to bobsled . "" Sports are so good for girls , particularly a sport like bobsledding , " Racine said . " I ' ve learned so much from it : how to be competitive , how to work hard , how to not give up . Bobsledding is like life : The harder you push at the beginning , the faster the ride is all the way down . " 	 1
Santiago , Chile Chile ' s Communist Party said it wants authorities to exhume poet Pablo Neruda ' s body as part of an investigation into his 1973 death ." There is no other way to resolve this terrible doubt , " lawyer Eduardo Contreras told Chile ' s Radio Bio Bio in an interview quoted in a statement on the party ' s website .The Nobel Prize winning poet ' s death certificate says he died of prostate cancer , but Neruda ' s former chauffeur alleges that he was killed by an injection in the clinic where he was undergoing treatment , the Communist Party said .Neruda died on September 23 , 1973 , just 12 days after a right wing military coup that overthrew the South American country ' s government .Chilean Judge Mario Carroza ordered an investigation into Neruda ' s death in June , noting that police , witness and medical records would be examined , Chile ' s judicial authority said .The judge has not said whether Neruda ' s body will be exhumed .A biography of the poet on the website of the Neruda Foundation , which Neruda ' s widow founded to promote and preserve his legacy , notes the coup as a significant date in his life ." The majority of Neruda ' s friends were made prisoners or had to hide or seek political asylum in other countries , " it says .But the foundation ' s leader told Radio Bio Bio this week that the organization opposed the exhumation because they did not believe there was a " third party " involved in Neruda ' s death ." We are against an exhumation of his cadaver because it would seem to us a true act of desecration , " Juan Agustin Figueroa said .Neruda , a member of Chile ' s Communist Party , was also a lawmaker in the South American country and served as its ambassador to France .But internationally , he is most well known for his poetry .Neruda received the Nobel Prize in Literature 1971 " for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent ' s destiny and dreams . "As part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during Gen . Augusto Pinochet ' s rule , authorities exhumed former Chilean President Salvador Allende earlier this year .Official accounts ruled the leftist leader ' s death a suicide , saying that he shot himself with a gun that was reportedly a gift from Fidel Castro as Pinochet ' s troops closed in on the presidential palace .In July , Chile ' s Legal Medical Service confirmed that suicide was the cause of Allende ' s death . 	 0

" we were all held captive by his erudition and charm. first, a brief history of the opium trade, then a bit of brahms on the piano, then a rousing discussion of virgil. that boy is a wonder, isn't he? " according to guests, the subject of virgil arose serendipitously, when a servant opened a window in the red room, to which the group had retired for after dinner drinks. noticing the breeze, bush raised his glass and delivered a toast to the changing of the seasons. he then apologized to " lovely winter, " explaining that he " meant no slight against her. " " the first blush of spring always reminds me of virgil's words, " bush said. " in early spring tide, when the icy drip melts from the mountains hoar, and zephyr's breath unbinds the crumbling clod, even then'tis time press deep your plough behind the groaning ox and teach the furrow burnished share to shine. " " book one of the georgics, of course, " bush added. bush arranged the small, informal dinner in honor of camps'unexpected arrival in america. " it had been too long since i'd heard one of w.'s anecdotes, so i simply got on a plane, " camps said. " i showed up at his doorstep with a watercolor by ignat bednarik, whom i know he adores, just to make sure he'd let me in. " bush confessed that he has " long held a fascination with the classical world, " noting that his love of roman history influenced his decision to enter politics. " virgil was born in the year 70 b. c. let's see, that would be during the consulship of gnaeus pompeius the great and marcus licinius crassus, if i'm not mistaken, " bush said. " it is said that while virgil's mother was with child, she dreamt she gave birth to a laurel branch, which, upon touching the ground, sprang up into a full grown tree, its branches laden with ripe fruits and flowers. the next morning, she gave birth to virgil. the legend goes that virgil was born without crying, so mild was his countenance. " according to white house regulars, it is not uncommon for bush to engage guests in discussions of whatever subject strikes his fancy, from the symphony playing in the background to the history of a style of jewelry a guest happens to be wearing. " i love to hear george hold court on this or that, " said bush family friend and world renowned physicist norberta m nter. " i tell him he is such a spoiled brat, the way he demands our attention, but i must confess i can't take my eyes off him when he does. " as the group sipped apple martinis and, in bush's words, " recovered " from the chilean sea bass, the president continued. " most primarily associate publius vergilius maro with the aeneid, " bush told guests. " yet so much pleasure is to be found in his lesser known works the eclogues, completed in 37 b. c., and the georgics, in 30 b. c., both of which praise the idyllic rural life. " " you have to remember i'm a bit of a farm boy myself, " chuckled bush, referring to his 1, 600 acre ranch in crawford, tx. " the bucolics are my personal favorite, " bush said. " they were basically a thank you to asinius pollio for preventing the seizure of virgil's land by the triumvirate when they ordered the lands on the far banks of the river po distributed to veterans of the victory at philippi. they are so sublime, so inspirational. but why should i speak, when virgil can do so himself? and far more eloquently, i might add. " bush then recited a selection from the bucolics in the original latin, pausing occasionally to translate into french out of respect for his friend am lie du maurier, a young parisian concert violinist in attendance. earlier in the evening, a blushing du maurier admitted to bush that she did not know latin. bush eased the young woman's embarrassment with a joke. " i wouldn't be surprised if your father forbade you from learning latin, out of sheer distaste for res publica, " said bush, alluding to du maurier ' 	 1
standing in ploshtad sveta nedelya the large square which spreads out at the heart of sofia i am momentarily unsure what year it is. behind me, the holy sunday church is a swarthy slice of the 19th century an orthodox temple competing for souls with the 16th century banya bashi mosque, which sits a few doors down. in front, the broad facade of the tzum department store is an austere reminder of the grim communist fifties even as it towers over the archaeological remains of the roman settlement of serdica, which are framed beyond glass at my feet. only when the adjacent metro station bursts into life, disgorging a crowd of commuters, does the 21st century seem to feel present and correct. a church to haunt a million postcards : the magnificent aleksandar nevski cathedral is sofia's landmarkbulgaria's capital is rarely anybody's first suggestion for a mini break. but, easily reached via a three hour ( direct ) flight from london, it is deserving of closer attention not least because few cities wear their past quite as openly as this fascinating little corner of eastern europe. just about every dominant power that ever thrived on our home continent ancient greeks, road building romans, ottoman turks, the heavy hand of the soviet union has had its say here at some point. the result is an intriguing cocktail of architectural styles and overlapping eras that is certain to delight more intrepid travellers. exploring the centre, i soon encounter the aleksandar nevski cathedral. indeed, it is hard to miss sofia's keynote building. it is the sort of dreaming wonder of a church that, were it located in paris, rome or barcelona, would gaze out from a million postcards. in truth, it looks like it has escaped from moscow an epic, domed creation that was built between 1878 and 1912, at a time when bulgaria was in thrall to tsarist russia. its flanks are adorned with mosaics while its interior, where the aroma of incense hangs thick in the air, is a feast of space. it has a neighbour too, the smaller st sophia a humble red brick pile that, remarkably, has occupied its site since the sixth century. inside, medieval frescoes supply colour and beauty, saints peering piously at the observer. unknown quantity : sofia is one of europe's most historic cities, but is rarely on the tourist mapsofia loves its churches but it also revels in culture. the sofia city art gallery, with its 3500 strong cluster of contemporary works, is a treasure trove. yet the motherlode is the national art gallery. pitched inside a former royal palace, this is a pleasing place to spend an afternoon, its many paintings hung in high ceilinged chambers where the affairs of court once played out. the names of the painters whose pieces decorate the walls will not, perhaps, be familiar but the striking landscapes and rural scenes crafted by bulgarian luminaries like anton mitov and vera nedkova are eye catching nonetheless. somewhat bizarrely, the national museum of history is hidden four miles south west of the centre, in the suburb of boyana. you need to take a taxi to reach it but the inconvenience is offset by the collection that awaits. bulgaria's full tale is revealed here. the priceless panagyurishte treasure a clutch of gold goblets from the fourth century bc recalls the days when the area was part of the ancient greek region of thrace. crusader swords and world war weaponry tell military stories of different vintages. and the building regales you with the most dramatic yarn of all. this sturdy block of concrete, with its sweeping staircases and enormous rooms, was used for state events in the iron curtain epoch. there is still a distinct whiff of bond villain's lair to its angular bulkiness. however, it would be wholly incorrect to say that sofia exists in some sepia yesteryear. and you don't have to look too closely to see a vibrant, modern city of quiet confidence. trundling along : a tram rolls past the tsentralni halite market hall where you can find quality winesthere are flashes of the now in the broad tsentralni halite. sofia's main market hall may be a happy relic, dating to 1911, but the picture inside is decidedly up to date a host of stalls selling organic olive oils and fruity bottles of bulgaria's increasingly quaffable wines a small bar where locals discuss the issues of the day over discreet glasses of beer. this image blossoms on vitosha bulevard. sofia's key drag is largely pedestrianised, and when i amble along it in late afternoon, a merry crowd is in evidence families milling around the shops, worker bees heading for the hive of bars and cafes. it is not quite the champs elys es, but it hints at something that 	 0
Washington DC Fast on the heels of his ' Wet T Shirt ' fundraiser in support of a woman ' s right to choose , Vice President Joe Biden is continuing his campaign to explore America ' s moral convictions with the announcement of a celebrity ' keg mixer ' to promote gun control ." This is just the tip of a really big f ing iceberg , " Biden said this morning to a gathering of the White House ' s press corps . " The President and I have an agenda , and we ' re taking this f ing agenda to the people . "In the Rose Garden , Biden explained the need to engage citizens in a national dialogue about gun violence . Starting this March at Penn State , the Vice President along with members of U . S . Olympic drinking team will launch an exhaustive cross country tour of celebrity ' keg mixers ' which he hopes will get Americans talking about the need for Congress to enact sweeping legislation .His target ? Gun violence ." What we ' re going to do is put a gun to the head of this issue , " Biden proclaimed with his wife standing at his side . " These gun manufacturers , ammunition lobbyists , and the NRA are in our crosshairs . The time for the average citizen to pull the trigger is now , and we aim to get that put down . "The bus convoy casually dubbed the ' Kegs for Clips ' Brigade will continue across Pennsylvania and beyond , with eventual stops planned for every state university or private college in ten Midwestern states ." We ' ll do one shot for each and every victim of a handgun or an assault weapon until we ' ve tossed one back for every lost soul , " the Vice President promised . " Today , it is my pledge that , for every casualty , we ' ll celebrate at least one shot of Jack , and we ' ll keep doing shots of Jack until the citizens of America wake up and call their Congressmen to tell them we won ' t stop until they pass President Obama ' s and my bill .

Washington ( AP ) The United States army has proudly recruited Pee Wee Herman to beef up its flagging war effort in Iraq ." With overall recruitment efforts lagging , our armed forces recruiters are now signing up any kind of misfit , including drug addicts , known sex offenders and notorious perverts , Catholic priests , high school dropouts , chimpanzees and just plain wackos and psychos , " admitted Colonel Bull Buntline at a news conference at the Pentagon . " We have to scrape them off the street and hold their hands steady to get them to sign , and falsify all sorts of education , criminal and medical records . Thus , we ' ve had to recruit Pee Wee Herman to bolster our efforts to obtain Iraqi oil to power American SUVs . "Parents and school counselors are advising potential recruits not to sign up , given the high rate of casualties in the illegal and immoral nature of the US wars , and other worries ." The pay isn ' t all that good , and veterans are facing perpetual cuts to their medical benefits and pensions once they return , if they ever do return , ' warned one concerned father , who asked not to be identified . " Once you sign on the dotted line , the army may never let you go , too . "For his part , Pee Wee Herman , who ' s real name is Paul Reubens , is glad to serve his country , and to avoid doing more jail time ." I can ' t wait till I ' m in those ravishing looking battle fatigues and helmet , and ready to defend my country " said the film star . " And with a real gun ! It is just absolutely so exciting . So fabulous . I really can ' t wait to get going and meet all those nice young men , and Arabs too . "The US army will fall far short of its full year recruiting goal for the first time since 1999 , and this raises big questions about the future of the military embroiled in its first protracted wars since switching from the draft to a volunteer force 32 years ago .Many young people and their parents have grown more wary of Army service because of the likelihood of being dispatched on combat tours to Iraq or Afghanistan , opinion polls show . US troops are now dying at a rate of nine a day in Iraq , with 37 wounded per day , more than two years after President Bush declared that major combat operations had ended .The army also admits that today ' s economy offers attractive alternatives to many high school and college graduates , like flipping burgers and running real estate and mutual fund scams .The recruiting statistics appear to bear that out . Officials said Wednesday that although the army will not release its numbers until Friday , it fell about 99 short of its target of signing up 6 , 700 recruits in May . The gap would have been even wider but for the fact that the target was lowered by 11 , 350 . There were also 56 , 897 cases of documented recruiting " improprieties " in all of 2004 .The seriousness of the situation was revealed when the army signed up one 21 year old in Ohio just five fours after he was released from a psychiatric hospital for murdering all the people in his apartment block ." But those are the sort of people we need in Iraq , " added Buntline . 	 1
This year Staffordshire University Men ' s Rugby Union Stoke have competed a rare treble after winning the league , Midlands Cup and varsity against Keele .This is not bad for a university that two years ago were relegated into the lowest league in the BUCS Championships . They also won ' Club of the Year ' title at our sports presentation night . But don ' t I wish I played a part of this rare featEver since I was seven I have been a fan of Rugby Union . The thing was I was never good at playing it . My dad took me to my local Rugby Club called Oadby Wyggs when I was seven and I wasn ' t bad at the tag version of the game . It all went downhill when contact was introduced . I was never good at tackling and would always be shoved on the wing to avoid contact . Whilst on the wing I would engage in conversations with the parents on the sideline and not really pay attention in the game , resulting in me once making a daisy chain 12 flowers long .My dad would drop me off at 10am and pick me up at half 12 . So at 12 : 20 when all the other kids were caked in mud I would still have white shorts and not a speck of mud on me . So I would quickly cover my hands with mud and wipe it over my face and knees to convince my dad that I had got just as stuck in as the other kids .At the age of 12 I gave up playing rugby , but still went and watched the Leicester Tigers most weekends at Welford Road . I dabbled in playing a bit of rugby during sixth form , but was still as bad as I was when I was 12 . My sister on the other hand seemed to get all the rugby genes in our family and I received none .Three years ago I joined Staffs University Men ' s Rugby Union and thought I could give playing rugby one last go . And for the third time in my life I finally realized that I was not born to be a rugby player . I am a qualified level one rugby coach and one day off my level two , but even though I know how to teach the sport I can ' t practice what I preach . I have made few appearances off the bench for Staffs Uni and the rest of the time I have been linesman .Although I did not play a part on the field I am very proud of what the team has achieved this year . It was great to see a university like Staffs Uni pick off all these bigger universities like Nottingham Trent , Nottingham and Oxford Brookes on the way to cup glory . During the season the firsts only lost one game and I am so glad to be leaving university rugby on a high . 	 1
a host of republicans is calling for the head of health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius over the troubled health care website rollout. thirty three republican members of congress signed rep. john fleming's letter to president barack obama demanding that sebelius be fired. but whether to sack her is not one of the questions we should be asking. the secretary spent 3 hours testifying before a congressional committee on wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of americans to sign up for health insurance under the affordable care act. punctuated by moments of contrition and obvious frustration, her performance was intended both to signal resolve to the american people that getting the website fully operational was her principal priority and to shield the president from the slings and arrows of the many critics of obamacare, who gleefully saw this as an opportunity to embarrass him and re energize their efforts to derail the law. the news wednesday was replete with stories of obama's sagging popularity, and one can't help but tie this drop, at least in part, to the problems with the rollout. so what is he, as our nation's chief executive, to do? should he heed those calls to demonstrate forceful leadership in a time of seriously flawed performance and fire sebelius? after all, the argument goes, something like this would not be tolerated in the business world. the consequences would be swift the person responsible for the mess would be fired. and didn't she admit in her testimony that she was responsible? yes, she did. but here's why the question of whether she should be fired is not the right one. obama needs to keep his eye on the big picture. the issue is not sebelius'future, it's what needs to be done to fix the mess. she has accepted responsibility and has specified a time frame within which she has said the dysfunction will be repaired. obama should support the secretary fully in her efforts. it is much more important for the president in the long run to make sure that people can sign up for insurance coverage under the aca than to finger a scapegoat and orchestrate a public beheading. the difference between forceful leadership and nuanced leadership is significant, and the context and circumstances should determine which or what blend of the two is appropriate. whatever momentary boost a " forceful " action might give the president in the polls would not justify the potential long term consequences of firing a cabinet member who arguably has served well in turbulent times. obama said wednesday that he would take ultimate responsibility, acknowledging that the buck stops at his desk. two very tough questions, however, lie ahead : first, what should he do about sebelius if the mess isn't a whole lot less messy by the end of november? and second, what about his own political capital? let's reserve judgment on the first one until the end of november comes around. at this point, my guess is that if implementation of the website hasn't improved very much, sebelius will resign. regarding the second, it's clear that obama has a lot riding on getting the system to work " well enough. " it might not happen by the end of november, but it will happen. it's not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies. why such a shambles? early indications point in two directions : diffuse authority ( no one was really in charge of the whole initiative ) and poor execution ( the contractors simply dropped the ball ). as we learn more about how the website was designed and tested, we will be in a better position to figure out what went wrong and where. but for the time being, we don't know so why drop the guillotine blade and run the risk of beheading the wrong person? the problem is real, and so are the politics. precisely because the aca is so important to the president, its detractors see a golden opportunity to inflict possibly serious damage on its future. this is political hardball on steroids, and the grandstanding that we see in front of the cameras helps us understand as if we didn't already why 74 of americans polled are unhappy with the behavior of congress. calls to fire the secretary are intended to put obama in the position of seeming weak if he does not. so he needs to respond in a way that is seen as decisive yet supportive of the secretary. the rearview mirror on the health information exchange mess isn't quite in focus yet, because we're still in the middle of it. but it's true that little changes tend to have small ripple effects, and big changes, like the health care act, have huge ripple effects. and no change, little or big, is ever without a glitch. life in washington is a circus. there are many rings with different 	 0
BAD AXE , Michigan In a move that has surprised most political pundits , word filtering out of the Paul Ryan campaign camp is that he has been advised by his top advisers to cancel his October 11 , participation in the Vice Presidential Debate with Vice President Joe Biden .Ryan ' s Chief Aide Woody " Mozzarella " Swizkinbrick spoke with GOPicky Magazine ' s Amos Soursuckle and explained what led to their decision .Soursuckle simply stated , " It basically came down to two words Joe Biden . "When asked to elaborate he shook his head , popped an orange Tic Tac in his mouth , and said that it does not take a rocket scientist , a Rhodes Scholar , or NBC ' s know it all employee Bob Costas to realize that " Skippy " Ryan has no business in a debate with the much more skilled , aggressive , and intelligent Joseph " The Pit Bull " Biden .Swizkinbrick went on to add that after speaking with literally thousands of GOP voters , that the overall consensus is that it would be best for Mitt Romney to not allow Ryan to tangle with Biden as it could cost him to lose at least 8 percent of the voters he already has .Ryan , who is known as Little Bunny Foo Foo , does not agree and he has insisted that he will jump in with both feet and even though he may look like a teacup Chihuahua next to Biden , he can still do some big time barking .Swizkinbrick has reportedly told the fella with the widow ' s peak that the issue is not open for debate ( no pun intended ) .SIDENOTE : An unnamed , inside source who is privy to the behind the scenes goings on of the Ryan campaign has stated that Pauly is so angry and so upset that he is seriously thinking of calling up Mitt Romney and telling him that he does not want to be on the same presidential ticket as someone who still looks upon him as an adult version of Eddie Munster . 	 1
The latest legal battle over same sex marriage is in the hands of a panel of California federal appeals court judges .Proposition 8 , a 2008 measure approved by California voters that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , was the focal point of Monday ' s Ninth U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals hearing .Opponents of the measure want the court to uphold a federal district judge ' s August decision , which ruled that the proposition violated the equal protection clause of the U . S . Constitution . Supporters note that the proposition was approved by 52 percent of voters , and argue that it protects the " institution of marriage . "" I believe it ' s to preserve the institution of marriage for the purposes that it has always served , " attorney Charles Cooper said , arguing that the key reason marriage exists in society is " that sexual relationships between men and women naturally produce children . "Attorney Theodore Olson , representing opponents of Proposition 8 , argued that the measure is unconstitutional and denies " the fundamental right of . . . citizens to marry . "" California has engraved discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation into its fundamental governing charter , " he said .Ultimately , the judges ' decision could hinge as much on who ' s arguing the case as what their arguments are .The first half of Monday ' s hearing focused on the legal standing of the parties appealing the federal district judge ' s decision ." The usual defendants when you challenge a law of the state are the governor and attorney general of that state . But the governor and attorney general of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown , both agree with the plaintiffs that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional , " he said .So in their place , other groups have stepped in to defend the measure .The question , Toobin explained , is " do they have the legal right to be there ? "Along those lines , the three judge panel opened Monday ' s hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision , including ProtectMarriage . com and Isabel Vargas , deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Imperial County , California , where voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 8 ." What ' s your best case to allow for your standing in federal court ? " one judge asked attorney Cooper , representing ProtectMarriage . com ." Your honor , I don ' t have a case , " Cooper responded , referring to relevant past court decisions .Cooper later urged the panel to consider the California Supreme Court ' s earlier ruling in favor of Proposition 8 " if you don ' t agree with me that we have standing . "Later Judge Stephen Reinhardt questioned attorney Robert Tyler , who represented Vargas , about how a deputy clerk , instead of the clerk , could have legal standing in the appeal . Tyler told the court that the county clerks are local officers , but they perform state functions such as civil marriages .Monday ' s hearing was the latest in a long running battle over same sex marriage in California .The state ' s high court had allowed same sex marriage , but then the 2008 Proposition 8 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote . The California Supreme Court subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people .Two same sex couples filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection .On August 4 , U . S . District Judge Vaughn Walker agreed , ruling that the voter approved ban on same sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the U . S . Constitution ." Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license , " Walker , who was appointed to the federal bench by former President George H . W . Bush , wrote in his 136 page opinion . " Indeed , the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite sex couples are superior to same sex couples . "Same sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia . The five states are Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont , Iowa and New Hampshire .Walker ' s landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court . 	 0

In a move that drew fire from medical marijuana advocates , federal authorities raided 26 medical marijuana dispensaries in 13 Montana cities , saying they have probable cause to believe that the businesses are involved in large scale trafficking .The search warrants executed Monday are the culmination of an " 18 month , multiagency investigation into the drug trafficking activities of criminal enterprises , " Michael Cotter , U . S . attorney for the District of Montana , said in a statement Tuesday .In addition , he said , civil seizure warrants for financial institutions in Bozeman , Helena and Kalispell were executed , seeking up to 4 million . Authorities did not disclose items that were seized pending the filing of search warrant returns in federal court .Probable cause exists to believe that the shops were involved in conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana and evade financial reporting requirements , authorities said . No criminal charges have been filed ." When criminal networks violate federal laws , those involved will be prosecuted , " Cotter said in the statement . Individuals who are in compliance with state law are not the focus of the investigation , authorities said .Medical marijuana advocates cried foul ." Not only are these raids very harmful and unnecessary , they are aimed at undermining the democratic process by preventing the people and legislators of Montana from addressing their own public health concerns , " Steph Sherer , executive director of Americans for Safe Access , said in a statement .The organization describes itself on its website as " the largest national member based organization of patients , medical professionals , scientists and concerned citizens promoting safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research . "Sherer said , " there is no doubt the raids were times to take advantage of a vulnerable political time for Montana patients . " Shere testified last week at a state Senate hearing on a bill to repeal the state ' s medical marijuana initiative . The measure , which passed the Montana House last month , died in committee , the organization said ." The public has been hoodwinked into believing the feds have changed their policy with respect to medical marijuana , but the evidence points to the same aggressive tactics under President Obama that we saw for years under the Bush administration , " Sherer said in the statement .Tom Daubert , who authored the 2004 medical marijuana initiative , told the Great Falls Tribune newspaper that the raids had a " chilling effect " on the state ' s medical marijuana community .Mort Reid , the owner of one dispensary , Canni RX in Billings , told KULR he closed his doors briefly Monday after hearing of raids elsewhere because he didn ' t want his patients or staff to be alarmed if he was raided . He reopened later in the day but said he is still concerned a search warrant might be executed there .Reid said he has written Montana Gov .

The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the Clinton family questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called " Clinton Cash : The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich " by Peter Schweizer , coming out May 5 .My guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt Team Clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary Americans the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to Bill Clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .It ' s not that the alleged conflicts aren ' t potentially serious as I recently noted in these pages , they are . According to The Wall Street Journal , in 2014 the Clinton Foundation " received money from the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and Oman , among others . The donors included Canada ' s foreign affairs department , which is promoting the Keystone XL pipeline . "That ' s the same Keystone XL pipeline from Canada that the State Department all but endorsed , concluding after a five part analysis that ran to 17 , 000 pages that the project ' s environmental impact would be minimal . President Obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it ' s legitimate to ask whether the donation from Canada directly or indirectly influenced the State Department ' s analysis .Those are serious matters but so are stubborn unemployment , troubled schools , high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters ' concerns . A bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild Haiti .Even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to Clinton charities , noted Jaffe , " there ' s no indication the Clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation ' s efforts . "That doesn ' t leave much room for outrage . A more serious critique of the Clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family ' s management skill in a less than flattering light .In a well known case of deception , a con man named Raffaello Follieri charmed his way into the foundation ' s good graces , earning public praise from Bill Clinton for promising 50 million to the Clinton Global Initiative money that never materialized .A more serious problem developed internally , with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities . In 2007 and 2008 , the foundation ran a 40 million deficit and in 2012 had an 8 million deficit .So we already knew that the Clintons ' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor . It ' s distasteful , but by now it ' s not news .Unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the Clintons ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about Hillary Clinton ' s use of private emails to conduct State Department business .According to a recent poll by the rightward leaning Rasmussen taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57 expect Clinton to win the presidency .No wonder Clinton seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book . " We ' re back into the political scene , and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I ' m ready for it , " she said in New Hampshire .Calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest " distractions " suggests that Clinton knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities . 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC The Federal Aviation Administration announced today that United Airlines Flight 43 , which crashed outside Parkersburg , WV last Thursday , was in fact brought down by passengers who voluntarily sacrificed their lives in order to prevent the screening of the in flight movie selection , Big Momma ' s House 2 .All 105 people onboard died in the crash ." As we examine the passengers ' cell phone calls and flight recordings , we get a sense of the incredible courage displayed by these ordinary men and women , " said FAA Administrator Marion Blakey at a press conference Monday , during which excerpts from the recordings were played . " They acted in the only way they could to stop this unspeakable horror starring Martin Lawrence as an FBI agent who goes undercover as a nanny for a sexy murder suspect . "" These people are true American heroes , " Blakey added .Flight 43 left New York ' s LaGuardia Airport on schedule last Thursday at 10 : 17 a . m . en route to Los Angeles with no indication of any suspiciously bad entertainment activity aboard . Black box evidence indicates that , 40 minutes after takeoff , the crew walked through the cabin and asked passengers to close their window screens . The audio recording goes eerily quiet after a flight attendant can be heard announcing that Big Momma ' s House 2 would be shown ." It will be days , months perhaps , before we have a complete picture of exactly what happened , " said FAA crash investigator Matthew Roberts , whose team was given the unpleasant job of analyzing Flight 43 ' s last moments . " But we know that the passengers somehow assembled toward the rear of the cabin without attracting attention to themselves which couldn ' t have been easy , considering the tense silence that typically accompanies a Big Momma ' s House film and decided that they would rather die than let anyone do this to them . "Around 11 : 00 , business class passenger Charles Rice left an emotional message on the cell phone voicemail of his fianc e , Kathi Kearney ." Honey , it ' s me , " Rice said in one of the excerpts . " I God . Listen , they ' ve darkened the cabin , and they ' ve started showing Big Momma ' s House 2 . The second one , I mean , and it it ' s pretty bad . This might not go well , honey . A bunch of us are going to try to stop them . I have to go , we ' re going to go now . God , I am so sorry . You know I love you . "Although Roberts said they may never determine who acted first or how the passengers organized their resistance to the brutally awful comedy , it is believed that all onboard were united in their need to stop the movie from being shown . In an amazing coincidence , at least one other person aboard Flight 43 had actually survived a screening of the original Big Momma ' s House on an international flight in 2001 , which may have given them impetus to act ." It seems clear that , from the opening moments of the film , they knew exactly how it had to end either 99 minutes later as Martin Lawrence ' s excruciating mugging brought it all to a heinous conclusion , or with the deaths of everyone aboard , " Roberts said . " We can only hope that we would act with the same bravery and conscientiousness if presented with the same situation . "Cabin recordings seem to indicate that a refreshment cart was used to charge the attendant station at the front of the aircraft at a decisive moment in the film in which a sexy potential villain asks Lawrence ' s character for help removing her bra . Much of the recording is incoherent , but Blakey played a 15 second segment in which some of the flight attendants can be heard exhorting passengers to remain seated while others seemed to be voicing second thoughts ." Clearly , the passengers were facing well trained hard liners intent on doing as much damage as they could , " said Blakey , gesturing to the charred , partially melted Big Momma ' s House 2 DVD case found in the wreckage as evidence . " When they found the hospitality station locked down and secured as per airline policy , the only choice they had left was to infiltrate the cockpit . "One last garbled transmission was made from Flight 43 just before it disappeared from air traffic control ' s monitors . Though the FAA has not released it publicly , Blakey confirmed that the passengers can be clearly heard reciting the Lord ' s Prayer over the scream of the engines and the high falsetto shriek of a female impersonating Martin Lawrence .Plans are already underway to honor the victims by presenting them with the Presidential Medal Of Freedom , a 4 million memorial in the West Virginia field where Flight 43 crashed , and a proposed Spring 2007 release of Flight 43 , a big budget action comedy drama starring Chris Tucker as Martin Lawrence . 	 1

SAN FRANCISCO In an effort to gather evidence in their investigation of the presidential candidate ' s alleged misuse of her private email server when she served as secretary of state , members of the FBI reportedly convinced actor George Clooney to wear a hidden listening device Friday night while attending a campaign fundraising dinner with Hillary Clinton .Sources confirmed that , following weeks of intense personal lobbying that ultimately persuaded the Hollywood A lister to secretly record Clinton , a pair of special agents met with Clooney in a dimly lit interrogation room in their San Francisco field office , where they prepared him in the hours leading up to the party . There , sources said , agents stressed to the still reluctant celebrity that Friday evening ' s event represented the government ' s best opportunity yet to record the former cabinet official possibly incriminating herself ." Look , George , I know you ' re nervous , but you ' re doing your country a big service , " Special Agent Carter Wilson reportedly said to a fidgeting , shirtless Clooney while using medical tape to secure the microphone wire to the actor ' s chest . " Mrs Clinton should be comfortable , relaxed , and talking freely tonight , so this is the perfect environment to get her to slip up . This mic will be recording the entire time , but you need to speak clearly , and make sure she speaks clearly , otherwise the audio might not be admissible in court . "" And she needs to admit her part in all of it , so keep prodding her until we get what we need just use your head so she doesn ' t catch on , okay ? he continued . " The last thing we want is to have to fish you out of the bay . "While awaiting Clinton ' s arrival at the party several hours later , the visibly anxious two time Academy Award winner who kept the listening device concealed beneath a dress shirt and black dinner jacket reportedly reminded himself again and again of the topics that the FBI requested he discuss with the Democratic frontrunner , as well as the list of specific names and dates they needed to hear her say .Shortly after 8 p . m . , upon spotting Clinton entering the premises , Clooney began making uneasy small talk with the former first lady , witnesses confirmed , asking her on several occasions to repeat herself more slowly while he adjusted the right side of his shirt collar . Clooney , who is said to have grown concerned that the presidential hopeful had yet to say anything revealing after an hour at the fundraiser , reportedly leaned in close to Clinton and mentioned that he had always been fascinated by computer encryption . According to sources , the comment elicited a quizzical glare from the candidate and a moment of prolonged , tense silence , which a panicking Clooney then attempted to awkwardly defuse by explaining how he had been interested in the topic ever since he read the script for his 1997 film The Peacemaker about the high tech pursuit of nuclear weapons smugglers .Reports indicate that a sweaty , shaking Clooney then hastily excused himself , retreated to the bathroom , and proceeded to vomit into the toilet ." I can ' t do this , I can ' t do this , I can ' t do this , " Clooney is reported to have said , as the sound of his hyperventilation resounded in the headphones of the FBI agents monitoring him from a van labeled " Valley Catering Events that sat parked outside the party . " Oh , God , she can tell something is up . I know it . I just know it . "" She ' s going to kill me , " Clooney continued .Sources confirmed that the movie star eventually returned to the party after a brief pep talk from agents speaking to him through his earpiece , a speech that , according to sources , included one agent screaming at Clooney to " pull it together . " Despite steeling his nerves with several drinks and asking at least a dozen more leading questions , Clooney is said to have failed to secure any useful information from Clinton throughout the remainder of the evening and decided to leave the party before arousing any further suspicion ." Goodbye , Madame Secretary , " Clooney said before hesitantly embracing Clinton , his heart reportedly racing as the former senator ' s hand slowly ran along his back just inches from the FBI transceiver . " It ' s always a pleasure talking with you . "" And let me know if you ever want to finish that chat about Libya , " he added .Witnesses reported that , moments later , a stone faced Clinton whispered into the ear of her largest Secret Service agent , who intercepted Clooney on his way out and offered to escort him to his car . 	 1
Bobbi Kristina Brown ' s aunt has claimed that her boyfriend Nick Gordon is being investigated by police for trying to murder her .Leolah Brown wrote on Facebook that her family has ' strong evidence of foul play ' relating to the day in January when Brown , 22 , was found face down in a bathtub .She is currently on life support in Atlanta , Georgia . The dramatic claims are part of a long running family feud between Gordon and other parts of the Brown clan .Leolah made the claims which she says law enforcement are aware of and following up in response to Gordon , 25 , being invited on the Dr Phil chat show .Life support : Bobbi Kristina Brown , pictured above with Nick Gordon in 2012 , was found face down in a bathtub in January . Gordon has now been sensationally accused of trying to kill herIn a message addressed to host Phil McGraw , she said : ' With all due respect , Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece Bobby Kristina Brown .' We have strong evidence of foul play . Until this investigation is completed by law enforcement , I would ask that you or anyone else not provide this individual a platform to spin this situation to his benefit .' If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece ' s body was found in a bathtub , he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded . 'Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell , Georgia .It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived . Few other details have emerged .There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub .Leolah kept up the attack in later comments on her Facebook page . She later wrote : ' Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! Especially to my family . Moreover , he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do !

The episode , pictured above , is yet to airA spokesman for the show said Gordon and his mother , Michelle , described him as haunted by what happened to Brown and the similar tragedy that befell the late Whitney Houston .Houston was found face down and unresponsive in about a foot of water in a bathtub in the Beverly Hilton hotel on Feb . 11 , 2012 , just before the Grammys .On the show , Michelle said : ' As we sit here right now , my son ' s life hangs in the balance . When Whitney was found , he administered CPR to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying , " Mom , why couldn ' t I do it ? I couldn ' t get air into her lungs .

WASHINGTON Activists say the U . S . is handing the enemy a victory the longer it allows the detention of enemy combatants at the U . S Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ." When we leave them at Guantanamo , in a military prison , we give them a status they don ' t deserve , " said John Hutson , a former U . S . Navy judge advocate general . " We make them heroes and martyrs to their friends and colleagues back in terrorist camps , " he said .Ten years after the first detainees were brought to Guantanamo from what was considered the battlefield in Afghanistan after 9 11 , constitutional and judicial experts held a news conference Wednesday to say the Obama administration needs to restore American values of human rights and the rule of law .Hundreds of protesters rallied later outside the White House as part of the event , with organizers saying the rally was to " call on President Obama to keep his promise and shutter Guantanamo Bay now . "Under the Bush administration , the United States claimed that Guantanamo Bay detainees are not on U . S . soil and therefore not covered by the U . S . Constitution , and that " enemy combatant " status means they can be denied some legal protections .President Barack Obama in January 2009 ordered the camp to be closed within a year , citing security concerns . But as of July of last year , 171 detainees remained at Guantanamo .Their prolonged and murky circumstances were the focus of the Wednesday event ." There is no case that is so important that we should sacrifice our dedication to human rights and rule of law , " Hutson said . " It ' s not a rule of law unless it applies all the time , and it ' s not a human right unless it applies to all people . "Morris Davis , a former chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo , said political interference from back home during the Bush administration blocked any basis for a fair trial ." Initially I was probably the leading proponent for Guantanamo , and for military commissions , " Davis , a retired Air Force colonel , said Wednesday . But he eventually resigned after he said the Bush administration pressured him to use evidence he felt was obtained through torture ." I believed at the time that we were committed to having full , fair and open trials , " Davis said . " I resigned when I lost confidence that that was our commitment . "Obama , in a 2009 speech delivered in Cairo , Egypt , acknowledged that the U . S . had acted " contrary to our ideals " in the time that followed the 9 11 attacks . After telling his Middle East audience he had " unequivocally prohibited the use of torture , " Obama then said he had " ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed , " on a timetable that would have ended about a year ago ." If we roll up the Constitution every time that there ' s a difficult factual situation , we might as well roll up the entire democracy , " said Vincent Warren , executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights .Talat Hamdani , a Muslim American whose son died in the attacks on World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 , spoke at the rally in front of the White House ." We say we are not at war with Islam , yet actions do speak louder than words , " Hamdani said . " Guantanamo is a shame a disgrace for our nation and we need to set the record straight by leading by example . "Despite a steady downpour of rain , the large group of protesters including some in orange jumpsuits symbolizing the Guantanamo Bay detainee uniforms , marched past the White House and on to the Supreme Court following the rally . 	 0

New York City Mark Goodman , a former VJ from the 1980 ' s heyday of MTV , was hauled away in handcuffs last week after being caught hitting the button that turns all Sirius XM radios on , regardless of whether the customer has paid for a subscription to the satellite service or not .The break in occurred in Manhattan at the company ' s headquarters and when police arrived , Goodman was hitting on a hot , blonde chick in one of the hallways .The room where Goodman had pushed the secret button turning on all Sirius XM radios was located down the same hallway and behind a secret entrance .The only way to gain entry into the secret room is by standing in front of the door while belting out Billy Idol ' s " White Wedding . " If the computer deems your imitation worthy , the six inch steel door is automatically unlocked .There is still no word on how Goodman learned of the secret song password but it ' s widely known the group of former MTV stars has a vast knowledge of inside information about the music world .The company was upset about Goodman giving away their product for free , sometimes for several weeks at a time . The former VJ said he never meant to hurt the company and only gave listeners the freebie out of the goodness of his heart ." I ' ve done it before , and I ' ll do it again , " Goodman remarked . " Next I plan to hit OnStar and , after that , I ' m going to take over MTV ' s studio and play nothing but music videos , returning the station to its glory days , damn it ! "Still recuperating from his recent liver transplant surgery , the former VJ didn ' t put up a fight against police when they took him into custody .A company spokesman for Sirius said a crime like this would normally mean several years in jail but , in Goodman ' s case , he ' ll probably just pay a small fine and go home . It ' s hard to throw the book at Mark because , well , doggone it , people like him . 	 1
I ll tell you when we ve accomplished it , he said before meeting with Austria s foreign minister , then promptly added , If . If .On Thursday , Kerry held preliminary meetings with participants in the talks . In a sign of how the Syrian conflict ? which is in its fifth year ? has upended traditional politics , one of his first sit downs was with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif .The alliance between Russia and the regime of Bashar al Assad goes back decades . Here ' s a bit of historical context that explains why Russia is fighting to prop up its closest ally in the Middle East . ( Ishaan Tharoor and Jason Aldag The Washington Post )Iran has provided military and financial backing to Syrian President Bashar al Assad , but this is the first time it has been invited to join international talks on resolving the conflict . It also marks the first time that the United States and Iran are working together since striking a landmark nuclear deal in July in Vienna and underscores that no solution to the conflict is possible without Iran s involvement .Kerry spoke with Zarif about implementing the nuclear agreement and raised the issue of U . S . citizens detained or missing in Iran , said State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner .Assad s future left in limbo for nowThe nations coming together Friday in Vienna have divergent views of the role Assad should play in his country s future .The United States , Turkey , Saudi Arabia ? as well as other Persian Gulf nations ? insist that any transition period must end with Assad relinquishing power . Iran and Russia , his biggest backers , have said that they are not wedded to the idea of Assad remaining in place indefinitely . But they also maintain that without Assad , Syria would collapse into unacceptable chaos .On Thursday night , Kerry met with diplomats from Russia , Turkey and Saudi Arabia .State Department officials have said that they do not expect countries with such disparate viewpoints to agree on a solution anytime soon but noted the urgency of advancing dialogue on ways to pull Syria out of a deep dive .Ground level : On the scene of controversial Russian strikes in SyriaOct . 12 , 2015 ? A boy makes his way through rubble at a site hit by what activists said was a barrel bomb dropped by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Assad in the town of al Ghariyah al Gharbiyah in Deraa province . Alaa Al Faqir ReutersThe challenge that we face in Syria today is nothing less than to chart a course out of hell , Kerry said in a speech Wednesday before departing for Vienna .The increasingly urgent diplomatic push for a resolution in Syria is driven by several factors , including Russia s role and a migrant crisis that is overwhelming Europe .Russia began carrying out airstrikes in Syria late last month , an intervention separate from the bombing campaign by a U . S . led coalition .Moscow claims that its airstrikes target the Islamic State , the extremist group that controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq . The United States contends , however , that most of Russia s bombing raids have targeted opponents of Assad , including U . S . backed moderate rebels . Washington considers that approach counterproductive , arguing that only when Assad s departure is ensured can Syrians unite to fight the Islamic State .Russia s move into Syria upends U . S . plansMany Syrians appear to have lost hope that any end to the fighting is near , though , and hundreds of thousands have fled to Europe to build new lives , straining governments there . 	 0

WASHINGTON Workers who are legally prescribed marijuana to treat illness can still be fired from their jobs , following a ruling Thursday from the California Supreme Court .Medical marijuana user Angel Raich , 41 , had her pot confiscated while her case was appealed .The 5 2 decision upheld the job termination of Gary Ross , who flunked a company drug test shortly after being hired at a telecommunications firm .A state referendum that allows people to use medical marijuana with a physician ' s recommendation are immune from some state criminal drug possession charges . But the state high court said such legal protection only goes so far ." Nothing in the text or history of the Compassionate Use Act suggests the voters intended the measure to address the respective rights and duties of employers and employees , " wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar . " Under California law , an employer may require pre employment drug tests , and take illegal drug use into consideration in making employment decisions . "The court agreed with RagingWire Telecommunications ' contention it had a right to fire Ross because any marijuana use is illegal under separate U . S . law . The company said its work across state borders could put it in legal jeopardy from federal labor standards involving the conduct and production of its work force .The U . S . Supreme Court has said the Bush administration can prohibit the backyard cultivation of pot for personal use , because such use has broader social and financial implications .A federal appeals court last March said medical marijuana users can be subject to arrest and confiscation of the material , under federal anti drug laws .The issue is being closely watched because of the obvious conflict between state and federal laws over the use of medical marijuana . Various courts have said the federal Controlled Substances Act does not violate state autonomy .The latest case involves Ross ' back problems stemming from injuries sustained when he served in the U . S . Air Force . He received a physician ' s recommendation to use pot in 1999 and presented a card certifying his use of the narcotic when he took the employment drug test in 2001 .Ross said his condition does " not affect his ability to do the essential functions of the job " his former employer hired him to do , according to his original complaint .The Sacramento based company said its no tolerance policy applies to all workers , since potential " abuse of drugs and alcohol " could lead to " increased absenteeism , diminished productivity , greater health costs , increased safety problems , and potential liability to third parties , " according to the company ' s lawyers .Ross ' job performance was not at issue in the case .The state supreme court said the law allowing use of marijuana for some patients is " modest " in scope , limiting the rights of some patients .The U . S . Supreme Court ruling in 2005 for the Bush administration giving it broad authority to crack down on illegal drug use was criticized by patient rights groups and the movement to legalize marijuana ." Congress ' power to regulate purely activities that are part of an economic ' class of activities ' that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established , " wrote Justice John Paul Stevens .Under federal law , the Controlled Substances Act prevents the cultivation and possession of marijuana , even by people who claim personal " medicinal " use . The federal government has argued its overall anti drug campaign would be undermined even by limited patient exceptions .That high court case involved a separate lawsuit from a pot patient from Oakland , California , who has a variety of medical conditions , including a brain tumor . Angel Raich had her pot confiscated and was not allowed to use it while her case was appealed .The Drug Enforcement Administration began raids in 2001 against patients using the drug and their caregivers in California .Along with California , 11 other states have passed laws permitting marijuana use by patients with a doctor ' s approval : Alaska , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington . Arizona also has a similar law , but no formal program in place to administer prescription marijuana .California ' s Compassionate Use Act permits patients with a doctor ' s approval to grow , smoke or acquire the drug for " medical needs . "Users include television host Montel Williams , who has multiple sclerosis . E mail to a friend 	 0
We ' ve come a long way since my early days as the associate medical director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1980s and 1990s .By 1990 , I had seen over 500 patients die from a disease that we just couldn ' t treat . As an infectious disease doctor , I was overcome not only by the tragic loss of life , but also by the inability to find the " magic bullet " to help prevent these deaths .Like many of my colleagues , I devoted my time to caring for my patients and to research . I am proud to say that many of the successful antiretroviral treatments ( ART ) that were developed emerged from San Francisco General .HIV AIDS treatment was then , and remains today , a true game changer in saving lives . In the early 1990s , we made unprecedented progress in addressing AIDS in the United States by putting people on treatment .Yet , when I traveled to Africa in the mid 1990s , I was devastated to see what was happening there . AIDS was literally destroying an entire generation , and eroding the very foundation of many African nations . At that time , 85 of the burden of disease was in sub Saharan Africa and less than 5 of the treatment capability was there .That was when I realized that devoting my energies solely to international work was the natural evolution of my career . I was determined that this history of lives needlessly lost would not be repeated . We could not and our country has not turn our backs on the suffering that was right in front of us .Today , as President Obama makes this historic trip to Africa , we are at a point where an AIDS free generation is within sight . With the world ' s largest number of people living with HIV and AIDS ( 5 . 6 million ) , South Africa has always been on the front lines of the epidemic .The U . S . government ' s response to the epidemic in South Africa began in 2003 when non governmental organizations initiated the provision of ART . In October 2009 , the tide truly began to turn when South African President Jacob Zuma declared : " We need to move with urgency and purpose to confront this enormous challenge . . . Most importantly , all South Africans need to know their HIV status , and be informed of the treatment options available to them . "The South African government , with support from the U . S . President ' s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis ( TB ) and Malaria , has saved hundreds of thousands of South African lives .To date , we have joined forces to provide 7 million South Africans with HIV testing and counseling , conducted over 170 , 000 voluntary medical male circumcisions for HIV prevention , and supported more than 1 . 6 million on ART . And South Africa has reduced the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV at six weeks of life dramatically from 8 . 7 in 2008 to 2 . 7 in 2011 .PEPFAR has invested 3 . 7 billion in supporting South Africa ' s HIV AIDS efforts . As South Africa ' s battle against AIDS has evolved , so has PEPFAR ' s support . Last year , we signed an agreement to make our partnership based on co investment , showcasing South Africa ' s leadership in caring for and treating its own people .As U . S . funding shifts increasingly to HIV prevention , health systems strengthening and technical support South Africa is expanding its own investments in the care and treatment of HIV and TB . With the South African government in the lead coordinating planning and alignment of implementation with PEPFAR , the Global Fund , and other development partners will we see reduced costs and increased access to health and social services .These new partnerships with high burden countries , forged by the Obama administration , have been a driving force in our collective push to achieve an AIDS free generation . They allow PEPFAR to invest its resources where they are most needed in those countries whose governments do not yet have the capacity to provide critical services for their citizens .Last week , I attended a 10th anniversary celebration of PEPFAR with U . S . Secretary of State John Kerry , at which he announced that the one millionth baby will be born HIV free this month , thanks to PEPFAR . One million babies in 10 years .Today , I am proud to stand with President Barack Obama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu at one of the pioneering youth and HIV centers in Cape Town . Thanks to the dedication of President George W . Bush , President Obama and bipartisan support from the U . S . Congress what a difference a decade has made .The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric P . Goosby . 	 0

CAPE GIRARDEAU , MO Brent Dobson , a 19 year old Army private who was reunited with his loved ones on May 8 after a harrowing two week ordeal as a prisoner of war in Iraq , is already " sick to death " of his family , Dobson reported Monday ." As I paced that 6x9 cell , with nothing but crumbs to eat , contaminated water to drink , and a broken piece of crockery to piss in , the thing that kept me going was thoughts of my family back home , " said Dobson , pacing his 10x11 bedroom in his parents ' home . " Well , after four days in this place , Iraq isn ' t looking quite so bad . "Added Dobson : " God , is my mom annoying . "On April 23 , Dobson , a member of the U . S . Army ' s 3rd Infantry Division , was liberated by Marines who discovered him in a makeshift POW camp outside An Najaf in central Iraq . Missing for 15 days and feared dead , the POW was flown back to the U . S . last Wednesday after spending two weeks recovering in an Army hospital in Hamburg , Germany . Upon touching down on U . S . soil , Dobson was moved to tears at the sight of his family a reaction he has since taken back ." I guess during my ordeal , I ' d forgotten that Dad clips his toenails in front of the TV , and that Mom obsessively runs the vacuum every day at 7 a . m . , " Dobson said . " If I take one step into the house with my shoes on , she starts shrieking like I just dumped a 40 pound bag of horseshit on the floor . "Dobson said he should have recognized early signs of trouble at a family organized homecoming celebration last Wednesday ." I ' d just gotten back and really just wanted to sleep , " Dobson said . " But the family wanted to throw a big party for me , and some relatives had come halfway across the country for it . Still , when when you ' re just weeks removed from being beaten by a member of Saddam ' s Republican Guard , you ' re not necessarily in the mood to make small talk with your 300 pound Aunt Irene over a plate of macaroni salad . "Dobson ' s maternal grandmother , Maureen Robb , was among the party attendees , but her outpouring of emotion and affection toward her grandson soon took a predictable detour into Christianity ." I was dumb not to have anticipated that at some point , she ' d start in with the ' Jesus this , Savior that , ' " Dobson said . " She actually said to me , ' Jesus was testing you , Brent , and you passed . ' After all the horrible shit I went through , I couldn ' t believe she was trying to save me . This is the same woman who persuaded my parents to put me in that wretched summer Bible camp when I was 11 . "At the homecoming party , Dobson was further dispirited by his uncle Mark , who would only discuss the NBA playoffs and his unusually high white blood cell count a sullen cousin who picked flaking paint off the side of the Dobsons ' home and his sister Karen , who forced her children Kaleb and Kaitlin to perform a grating " welcome home " rendition of " God Bless The U . S . A . " for the returning war hero .The day after the homecoming party , Dobson who had sustained a broken leg and wrist , as well as a bullet wound to the shoulder , during his imprisonment was put to work clearing leaves from roof gutters ." Yeah , I got roped into that pretty quickly , " Dobson said . " Mom told me that since Dad ' s lumbago had been acting up all winter , a lot of yard work went neglected . I thought of pinning the Purple Heart that Donald Rumsfeld awarded me to Dad ' s shirt as he snoozed in his Barcalounger , but I decided against it . "By the end of his first weekend home , Dobson realized that his main reason for joining the Army was to escape the Dobson clan ." I used to say that I joined the Army to escape Cape Girardeau , " Dobson said . " But what I was really trying to escape was my family . I love them , but they ' re clingy and whiny and bossy and cranky and snippy and annoying and smothering . Those Iraqi captors were pretty bad , but they ' re nowhere near as bad as my current ones .

When the 06 : 30 South West Trains service left Salisbury bound for London Waterloo yesterday morning , everything seemed normal .Normal passengers travelled in normal awkward silence , either lost in a normal tune on their normal whatever pod or staring blankly out of the windows whilst deperately trying not to make eye contact .Everything was normal . Until Keith Broachurst boarded the train at Basingstoke .Unfortunately for his fellow passengers , Mr Broachurst aged 34 , suffers from a rare phobia . A morbid fear of anyone being genuinely nice to him before 10 : 00 , or ' Amicaphobia ' .Keith told us that he has learned to control his fear and is proud of the fact that , after years of therapy , he can withstand approximately seven smiles per hour without vomiting or passing out . Sadly , this did not help him on this fateful morning .Miss Filgud , a local Basingstoke student aged 24 , boarded the train shortly after Mr Broachurst and was dismayed to find that no seats were available . Being a gentleman , Broachurst promptly offered his seat to her , which she gladly accepted . Too gladly as it turned out to be .Miss Filgud , who has a truly remarkable smile , was so happy with this chivalrous show of gentlemanliness , that she involuntarily let forth a magnificent beamer of a smile that could have lit a campfire at 100 paces .Even though he had made a concious effort to turn away from said super smile , Broachurst was caught in the glare of Ms Filgud ' s thousand watt happy beam and promptly began to projectile vomit over the occupants of the entire carriage .Within approximately five minutes , every passenger on the train was either blowing chunks , passing out , or heading for the nearest open window . ' I puked so hard , I nearly pooed in my pants ' said one of the passengers . Another described the scene as ' Sheer and utter hell with added bits of carrot and sweetcorn ' .The only person on the train who was left unscathed happened to be the driver , as he was effectively upwind at the time of the incident . 	 1
Police had hoped that the Pen Thief of Lytham St Annes had gone quiet , with no activity on the pen front in several years however , it now looks like he has started again , this time on memorial mugs and erasers ." Several years ago , " said Jenn Darme , head of the serious stationary theft division of Fylde constabulary , " there was a serious theft of an entire pen museum by this miscreant . We had hoped that he would surface when the pens were attempted to be sold , or melted down . However , we now suspect that the pens are a trophy , and will never see the light of day again . This is a shame , as some of the pens are worth nearly a quid . "Despite there being no serious activity on the stationary theft side for many years , the thefts have started up again ." The thief , " said Darme , " seems to be targeting novelty mugs emblazoned with company logos , and those small novelty erasers that go on the end of pencils and make it difficult to write . However , we ' ve also had reports of cups with any logo on also going missing . "The most recent high profile theft saw the loss of one of each of the latest RBS Mug Set , with photos of the managers getting more than a million in bonuses on the side ." They may have been taken , " said Darme , " or they may have just been smashed by an annoyed employee . We ' re not ruling anything out . "The police still have no leads on the Pen Thief of Lytham , but do suspect that he is a high ranking member of some secret society , like the scouts or the FA ." Somebody must know who this miscreant is , " said Darme . " We urge any members of the public with any information to ring crime stoppers on 007007 007007 . That number goes straight through to the assassination arm of Crimestoppers , as we want this criminal stopped permanently . " 	 1

Arsene has been a fantastic driver and has put the club in a great , great position .

'Gazidis , who has been in post for six years , is optimistic for the future and wants Arsenal to join the world ' s elite .Gazidis added : ' I wouldn ' t be doing this job if I didn ' t believe we could compete at the very top level .

It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years , so winning the FA Cup was a fantastic moment , ' Gazidis added .' ( But ) I don ' t come out of that feeling satisfied like we ' ve achieved what we need to achieve . The hunger for success is immediate .'

san francisco with its massive and fiercely loyal user base, chicagotheband. com the official internet home of the american music group chicago remains the most frequently visited website in the world, tech industry experts confirmed wednesday. chicagotheband. com, which features breaking news, song information, and tour dates for the nine piece brass inflected soft rock combo, reportedly draws upwards of 2. 5 billion daily pageviews, easily making it the most popular online resource of the modern internet era. " as far as sheer web traffic is concerned, there's only one name that matters right now, and that's chicagotheband. com, " said dave sherfesee, president of web analytics firm alexa, which estimated that the internet powerhouse charts more unique visitors than second tier sites facebook and google combined. " every second of every day, tens of thousands of visitors click on one of its pages, whether it's the band's blog or its discography, and no other website can match that volume of activity. it's not even close, frankly. " " in fact, our data indicates there are currently 1. 32 million chicagotheband. com message board users fervently debating whether'hard to say i'm sorry'or'you're the inspiration'is the band's definitive ballad, " sherfesee continued. " and that's just one of 200, 000 active comment threads. " according to reports, chicagotheband. com operates a 10, 000 square foot warehouse full of high bandwidth servers maintained by approximately 140 full time web developers and engineers who work in shifts to ensure uninterrupted access for the website's legions of users. analysts stated that at any given moment, approximately 10 million individuals are reading through the biographies of such beloved band members as robert lamm and james pankow, 8 million visitors are listening or relistening to the website's one minute and 19 second sample of the timeless rocker " 25 or 6 to 4, " and 35 million vip members are watching an array of exclusive behind the scenes videos available only in the site's 19 per year " premium access " section. additionally, chicagotheband. com's online store, which offers chicago branded t shirts, mugs, and mousepads, is said to draw more than 4 million customers per day and generate approximately 175 million in daily sales, a revenue stream approached only by online retail stalwart amazon. such impressive numbers can be attributed to the loyal, almost fanatical nature of chicagotheband. com's visitors, who explained that the website plays an integral role in their day to day lives. " first thing every morning i visit chicagotheband. com, check my email, glance at facebook, and then quickly head back to chicagotheband. com to see if there have been any updates, " said philadelphia resident jessica carville, 32, who like most americans maintains a presence within the website's fan network, known as " chicago the band music community. " " i would say that between hanging out in the chat room, viewing the latest clips of the guys in the studio, or sending birthday wishes to peter cetera, i spend a good two hours on there every day.

CHICAGO A string of inner city stabbings left five residents of Chicago ' s wealthy Highland Park suburb maidless this weekend .According to police , the crimes seem to be related , in that all five residents were left without kitchen and dining room service for their morning meal ." It was horrible , " said Highland Park resident Edmund O . Rayburn . " We were left with no choice but to perform such tasks as making the bed , running cold water from the tap , and pulling out chairs for ourselves before sitting on them . "The Chicago Police Department is conducting a full scale investigation of the interruption in maid service , and plans to issue a formal report to the Highland Park Gate and Security Service by the end of this week ." We ' re doing everything we can to find the perpetrator , " Police Chief Stan Jacoby said . " And we ' re urging everyone on Chicago ' s streets to be wary . We don ' t want any gardeners to disappear . There ' s been enough suffering . "According to reports , the Highland Park residents ' agonizing maidlessness lasted over 12 hours , ending only when a Chicago area domestic temp agency airlifted in emergency replacement maids , free of charge . " It was the least we could do , " said Marcy Peters , assistant manager of Maid Just For You ! " Nobody should ever have to go maidless . Ever . "Victims reported feeling confused and vulnerable , sometimes even frightened , during the hours in which they were maidless ." The doorbell rang and we didn ' t really know how to react , " Lillian Worthington , 58 , said . " We just sat at the table looking at each other until it stopped . "Fortunately for Worthington , the maid was the only member of her staff to be stabbed repeatedly in the throat , allowing services such as cooking and car washing to continue unaffected ." The wet towels in the bathroom didn ' t get replaced until after noon , and my newspaper wasn ' t even ironed , " said victim Peter Devlinger . " Georgette ' s murder couldn ' t have been more inconvenient . "The Devlinger household was further disrupted when the deceased maid ' s daughter arrived to pick up her mother ' s belongings . " She came in , sobbing hysterically , and I didn ' t know what to do , " Devlinger said . " Normally , that ' s just the type of thing that Georgette would handle . "For several of the residents , simply not knowing if their maid was all right was the hardest part ." I spent a lot of time on Sunday tracking my maid down , " said Edwina Haversham , head of the Haversham Insurance Trust Ladies ' Board . " I had to find out her name , and then I had to get her phone number from one of the other help , and then I actually had to speak with her family . It was a horrible , exhausting bother , and for what ? Just to find out that she ' d been killed , and I had to hire a new girl anyway .

Washington Some voters are facing a choice this November : vote or be shamed publicly .Voters in Alaska received a letter this weekend from the " Alaska State Voter Program , " which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question :" WHAT IF YOUR FRIENDS , YOUR NEIGHBORS , AND YOUR COMMUNITY KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED ? "Despite the official looking letterhead , the " Alaska State Voter Program " isn ' t a government initiative . The mailer came from the conservative Opportunity Alliance PAC , which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election , the Alaska Dispatch News reported Monday .And the political group says it will follow up after the election , with plans to send out a new mailer that lists which voters went to the polls on Nov . 4 ." You and your friends , your neighbors , and other people you know will all know who voted and who did not vote , " the group writes in the letter .The mailer could have an impact on the crucial Senate election in Alaska next week , where Republican Dan Sullivan is looking to unseat Democratic Sen . Mark Begich , especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps .One recipient of the letter told the Alaska Dispatch News she was creeped out when she realized she was Facebook friends with the 11 people listed in the mailer she received .It ' s not the first time groups have tried to shame voters into heading to the polling booth .Americans for Prosperity , a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers , sent voters in Virginia a " report card " last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box and their next door neighbor ' s ." You are one of the few individuals in your neighborhood that is not a regular voter . We ' re contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who doesn ' t vote " the AFP letter reads , according to local NBC affiliate WWBT . " Your neighbors who have voted in every election are concerned about our community ' s well being . They ' re concerned about the future of America . . . Are you ? "Voters in other states have received similar " report cards . " Another group , Values are Vital , sent Florida voters a mailer this spring that even graded their attendance record at the ballot box and also shared their neighbors ' voting track record .Liberal groups like MoveOn , the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and America Votes have also pressured voters with voting records . 	 0
Follywood is abuzz with the electric news that Master of Gore , Quentin Tarintino has cast Kate Gosselin and Joran van der Sloot as the leads in the remake of John Gunther ' s heroic novel " Death Be Not Proud ' along with his promise of a new and horrifying ending .The novel , based on a poem by John Donne , details the life of a young sociopath serial killer struggling with inner demons threatening to possess his soul after a mysterious virus enters his body when he ingests the worm at the bottom of a bottle of imported tequila while on holiday in Aruba .The movie is a heart rendering account of a normal teenager with raging hormones as he discovers his magnetic personality and ability to rhumbaacts as an irresistable aphrodisiac to a horde of thong wearing American Tourists whose parents should have known better .According to a critic who has seen the first rushes , the film opens with a ritualistic blood letting on a remote beach in the tropics where a half naked van der Sloot reads from a poetry book while standing over an open graveas he intones :" DEATH be not proud , though some have called theeMighty and dreadfull , for , thou art not so , For , those , whom thou think ' st , thou dost overthrow , Die not , poore death , nor yet canst thou kill me . "The erie opening only hints at the portents of evil to come as Joran , thanks to the money and privilege of his parents , takes off on an odyssey of self indulgence , narcissism and hubris , which takes him deeper into the darkness of death , but luckily , due to affirmative action , not into the Democratic Primary for the Presidency .Just as things look like they can ' t get any worse , Quentin , in a bizarre twist , introduces Gosselin as a single mother of eight who is down on her luck after realizing that her career as a reality star has run it ' s course and she may have to put the kids up for adoption and get a real job .Gosselin ' s depression takes her to Mexico when she hears there is a 100 , 000 prize for the national rhumba contest , and despite her lack of rhythm and being tone deaf , she manages to hook up with Joran in a chance meeting at a Burrito Bar in Rancho Dos Putas .The film , in true Tarantino style , flashes between sweaty practice sessions in an abandoned taco factory , to surreal episodes of more killing by Joran as he seduces , than dispatches his victims .While the audience is left cringing at the horrific scenes of betrayal , one can palpably feel the switch of allegiance to Joran as his relationship with Kate begins to develop and her real personality emerges as a manipulating , self serving witch with an agenda to rival Joran ' s . In one scene shot in the kitchen of her apartment , she seems totally self absorbed as she describes to Joran in great detail the short comings of her former husband ' s Jon ' s diminutive penis as she violently peels a cucumber with a utility knife .Without revealing the chilling ending of this latter day morality play , I can only say , you too will be on your feet cheering Joran on as this tour de forcereaches its dramatic crescendo !Tarantino , as usual is unsparing in his graphic violence which he uses to unabashedly point out the decay in today ' s society .There is one line that will go down in history along side such classics as :' Are you talking to me ? "Truth , You can ' t handle the Truth ! "Go ahead , make my day ! "The soon to be famous line is Joran , his face cast in shadow wearing a Tommy Bahama shirt , baggy silk shorts and a pair of designer sandals , siding up to a blonde in a beach bar and whispering in her ear : Hey , Babe . . . . wanna Dance ?

Hong Kong They carried bright yellow umbrellas , chanting " I want true democracy , " as they festively made their way through Hong Kong ' s streets .For the first time in more than a month , demonstrators peacefully took to the roads , many said , to make their voices heard and let their government and the world know that their fight for universal suffrage continues .Joshua Wong , 18 , one of the student leaders of the movement , was one familiar face in the crowd ." This rally is to let people know the umbrella movement is not over , " Wong said , referencing the iconic symbol chosen by the demonstrators when they occupied the streets of Hong Kong for two and a half months late last year .The turnout , though , fell far short of expectations , even for organizers .While the group behind the march the Civil Human Rights Front had forecast 50 , 000 people to join , they estimated only 13 , 000 took part in the procession . A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Police Force put that number at just 8 , 800 .While admitting some disappointment , Daisy Chan with the Civil Human Rights Front was still upbeat , saying the march had achieved its main goal : to remind the Hong Kong government that the reform proposal currently on the table for the 2017 election doesn ' t go far enough ." In the coming days , I think people will try to give more political pressure , not only through demonstration , but civil disobedience , in order to fight for true democracy , " Chan said .Dennis Yip , a 19 year old student who joined the march , called it " half successful " because new groups had joined . Some of them planned to meet after the rally to brainstorm the next steps , said Joshua Wong and other students .But it ' s unclear where this movement , which drew over 100 , 000 protesters at its peak in 2014 , goes from here , without a clear leader or strategy to achieve its aims .As Hong Kong works through the process of how its top leader will be elected in 2017 , the government has asked for feedback during a two month period of public consultations .But Hong Kong ' s leaders , including Chief Executive CY Leung , have made it clear that there are limits : reform must be within the framework outlined by Beijing .That framework has Hong Kong ' s next leader being directly elected for the first time , but notes that the candidates for the ballot will be screened by a nominating committee .The government responded to Sunday ' s protest march with a statement on its website : " The ( government ) calls on all sectors of the community to adopt an accommodating , rational and pragmatic approach , as well as an inclusive attitude to express views , to forge consensus so that 5 million eligible voters can elect the Chief Executive by universal suffrage through ' one person , one vote ' in 2017 . "One bright yellow sign held high by marchers along the route had a different interpretation : " Democracy Bottom Line . Do Not Cross , " it read .Since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997 , Hong Kong has been governed as a Special Administrative Region of China under the concept of " one country , two systems .

Related : Hillary Clinton targets Bernie Sanders ' ' flip flop ' on gun controlReferring to Donald Trump , the GOP frontrunner who spent the weekend happily deepening his argument with his nearest challenger , Ted Cruz , Bush told NBC s Meet the Press : The guy s entertaining , for sure . But he s not going not win the nomination . And I am .The former Florida governor s confidence is not backed by polling data . According to the realclearpolitics . com poll average , on Sunday he sat in fifth place nationally .That put the one time favourite ahead of seven candidates in the still crowded Republican field , but his 4 . 8 return left him nearly 30 points behind Trump ( 34 . 5 ) and well adrift of Cruz ( 19 . 3 ) , Marco Rubio ( 11 . 8 ) and even the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson ( 9 ) , whose numbers appear to be in terminal decline .Bush is off the pace in the two early voting states , Iowa and New Hampshire , polling at 4 . 5 in the first state and 8 . 4 in the second ( an improved figure which nonetheless leaves him sixth , behind New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Ohio governor John Kasich ) . In recent history , only Bill Clinton , in 1992 , has won a presidential nomination without taking either of those states .Nonetheless , Bush continued to attempt to take the fight to Trump .He s not a conservative , Bush continued , explaining why he thought he was the only person to have gone after Trump on economic issues in Thursday night s debate .Should the opportunity come up in the next debate to talk about Trump s bankruptcies , I ll do it . Four times bankrupt . He claims he was just using the law but a lot of people got wiped out because of that .Asked by host Chuck Todd what he thought was the secret of Trump s success despite his own efforts against him ? which now include an ad that quotes Bush calling Trump a jerk ? the former governor said : Well , there s a lot anxiety . People are frustrated with Washington they re frustrated about their own lives .Related : Bush seeks to insult his way to the presidency , calling Trump a ' jerk 'The big guy comes in and offers the moon and the stars , and people have latched on to that . But the reality is he s not offering anything to lift people up .Bush declined to say , though , that he would not support Trump if the billionaire won the Republican nomination . The prospect of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders being the next Democratic president was chilling , he said .I m going to win this nomination , that s my focus , that s what I m trying to do , but anyone would be better than Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders .Asked if it was time for the more moderate conservatives in the Republican field to unite and pick one candidate to stop Trump and Cruz , Bush avoided the question .New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and Nevada are going to shape the contest in March , he said , and we have the resources and we re on every ballot and I m going to do it . 	 0

The sculptures speak for themselves : Pi atas in the shape of decapitated heads bearing gunshot wounds adorn the walls of El Paso ' s Public Library in Texas .Artist Abel Saucedo says the exhibit , " Ciudad Juarez es the . 1 " has drawn mixed emotions from viewers .The exhibit , called " Ciudad Juarez es the . 1 , " is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo , 24 , a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso .Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico , and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border ." Every time you have a conversation here violence is brought up . It ' s on the front page , it ' s part of everyone ' s life , it ' s a reality . I decided to use a pi ata because it ' s a way to identify with my culture , " Saucedo said in a phone interview .The collection , which Saucedo describes as post modern conceptualism , contains four individual pi ata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size . The heads look as if they have been severed at the bottom of the neck and they are adorned with red paint and shot wounds on the forehead .They are all men one has glasses , one a golden tooth , one is smiling , and one has a mustache ." They don ' t represent anyone in particular , just the violence in the border , " Saucedo said ." I got a pressure gun and shot each pi ata so it would look like a gunshot . I also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face , " Saucedo said .The pieces , which took Saucedo six months to complete , were received with mixed emotions ." I have had all kinds of responses . People like them , they think it ' s a great idea . People think its offensive , sad , it ' s humorous , but people say it ' s the truth . In art I ' ve learned that everything everyone says , it ' s an opinion , " said Saucedo .El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint a man said he was " very offended " by the pieces . The library receives around 1 , 592 visitors per day ." As a person living here in the community , as an artist , this is my opportunity to speak , and it ' s tragic . My family and friends have had to move , it ' s tragic . I feel it ' s my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings , " said Saucedo .Enrique Torres , spokesman for the Mexican state of Chihuahua ' s Joint Operation said the violence is as brutal as ever ." We have anything from one dead a day to six or seven . Criminal groups have changed their strategy . They used to operate in high profile vehicles and large caliber weapons , now they use low caliber weapons and older model compact vehicles which are harder to detect , " said Torres .Chihuahua ' s Joint Operation oversees 7 , 000 Mexican soldiers operating in Juarez working alongside 2 , 300 federal Police and local police forces ." Ciudad Juarez es the . 1 " will run until July 31 . 	 0
The Serbian labeled compatriot Viktor Troicki ' s 12 month ban from tennis for missing a drugs test a " total injustice " and said he was now nervous to give any sort of sample .But Fahey dismissed the six time grand slam winner ' s comments as unhelpful and said it was up to the sport to do more to fight against doping ." If he wishes to then make a comment I might listen to him but for the moment I don ' t think that was an informed statement . "WADA ' s role in the fight against doping in sport has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of athletes failed tests in Kenya and Jamaica .And as well as Troicki , Croatian tennis star Marin Cilic also served a ban for doping offenses after taking a prohibited substance contained in supplements bought from a chemist .Those cases have provoked disagreement within the game as to the best course of action , with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray calling the pair ' s actions " unprofessional . "Roger Federer , winner of 17 grand slams , said more testing needed to be done within the sport and also said players should give a sample when requested .But when asked if he knew how widespread doping in tennis was , Fahey replied : " No I don ' t and nor do I think tennis knows how widespread it is ." What I do know is they have a program and a commitment has been given . Can they do more ? Every sport can do more ." And when you get criticism from some of the champion tennis players about the number of times they ' ve been tested then I hope tennis takes notice of it . I know they have and I believe that they ' ll address it . "Fahey also said the fall from grace of cyclist Lance Armstrong had been the best anti doping message since he became WADA president in 2007 .In January , Armstrong following years of strenuous denials admitted to doping throughout his storied career , after he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles .But Fahey thinks Armstrong ' s descent has proved that drug cheats will be caught out and punished no matter what their status ." I think the Lance Armstrong story was the best message in my six years as to the effectiveness of the anti doping programs , " he explained ." What that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are , how tall , how successful you are , you can get caught and be dealt with . That man has been destroyed in terms of reputation and in terms of , perhaps , many other aspects of his life ." He ' s been seen as a cheat , a bully , a liar there ' s no doubt about that . Once upon a time he was revered as one of the greatest champions in his sport , of all time ." The fact that someone as big as that is ultimately brought to justice shows that our code is effective . "As for athletics , Fahey acknowledged that doping is " widespread " and said part of the reason might be that there are different resources available to tackle the problem in different countries .Kenya has had 17 athletes banned for doping offenses since 2012 , while former 100 meters world record holder Asafa Powell and three time Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell Brown are among six Jamaicans to have tested positive this year .Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica , but rejected the notion performance enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport .There had been a suggestion that certain countries could be banned from the Olympics if they refused to comply with anti doping programs raising the prospect of Jamaica ' s six time Olympic champion Usain Bolt missing out but Fahey said that was for the International Olympic Committee to determine ." Should the Iinternational Olympic Committee take stronger steps ? I ' m sure if the evidence is there on the basis of difficulties with compliance in any particular country they would look seriously at that , " he said ." I think we have to stop for a moment and say , ' What is actually going on in Jamaica ? ' They do have an anti doping program , it has not been effective , it has not been as good as it could have been and that ' s what WADA examined ." We now have given them recommendations and we ' ve got a commitment to say , ' Yes we dropped the ball but we ' ve picked it up again and we ' ll get it right and we ' ll do that quickly . ' "Fahey also said that WADA ' s revised code , which is due out this week , would allow the agency greater investigative powers and called it a " great jump forward . " 	 0
LINCOLN , NE Oblivious to the thoughts and looks directed toward her as she shopped for groceries , stopped by the post office , and ran several other errands with her three young children , single mother Karen Nichols , 29 , was reportedly completely unaware that she was the focus of 984 separate judgments by strangers this afternoon .According to reports , during the five hours in which Nichols was accompanied by her kids , Erik , Sadie , and James aged 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively to a variety of locations throughout the city , she was the subject of nearly a thousand negative assumptions about her financial situation , relative parenting capabilities , and general promiscuity ." My God that is just so sad , " thought 45 year old local resident Rebecca Mueller , just one of 16 people in the local Stop and Shop parking lot who leveled a total of 29 judgments at Nichols as she struggled to secure her crying youngest child into a car seat . " If it ' s this bad out in public , can you even imagine how terrible it must be at home ?" Look at that she doesn ' t discipline them properly , and now it ' s everyone else ' s problem . That ' s what happens when you ' re not strict enough with your kids and just let them run totally wild . "" I bet those grocery bags are just full of sugary cereal and other junk food , " Mueller continued , making a judgment that three other onlookers had arrived at separately . " That ' s why she has absolutely no control over her kids . "Mueller echoed the sentiments of the roughly 300 other witnesses who observed Nichols with her children throughout the day , 37 of whom felt that if Nichols couldn ' t handle one child , she had no business having two more 42 of whom decided she probably sat them down in front of the TV all day because she didn ' t want to deal with them and 68 of whom , after quickly arriving at the conclusion that Nichols was on welfare , couldn ' t believe that ' s where their tax dollars were going .During a stop at a local drug store , Nichols was said to be the target of some 40 judgments within a single 15 second period when her eldest , James , began taking items off of the shelf in the toy aisle . Nichols ' sharp command for the child to return to her side quickly attracted the scorn of upward of a dozen onlookers , over half of whom immediately speculated that the evident lack of a positive male role model in the child ' s life would eventually lead him down the road to drugs and criminal activity ." Look at that she doesn ' t discipline them properly , and now it ' s everyone else ' s problem , " thought Henry Wilkins , 29 , rolling his eyes at the scene as he waited in the checkout line . " That ' s what happens when you ' re not strict enough with your kids and just let them run totally wild . "" Why is she being so hard on that poor kid ? 52 year old Sandy Werner thought while witnessing the same incident . " Honestly , she could stand to be a lot more loving and patient with him , or else he ' s going to end up as some delinquent . "Werner , along with six other bystanders , reportedly went on to assume that this same kind of unnecessarily controlling behavior is more than likely precisely what drives away all the men in Nichols ' life .According to sources , the single most concentrated number of judgments came during a late day stopover at a local diner . Among dozens of other criticisms , Nichols ' momentary pause to respond to a text message from her mother while her children ate their meals conjured up nearly 75 variations on the idea that Nichols mindlessly spends her whole life staring at her phone , barely considering her children ' s emotional needs ." She doesn ' t really look like she can afford to go out to dinner it ' s disgraceful , running up debt like that , " thought Glenda Frank , 71 , who looked on skeptically as Sadie , the middle child , momentarily clambered up the back of the family ' s booth before being replaced in her booster seat by Nichols . " It ' s probably just as well , though it ' s not like those kids are ever getting into college , anyway . "" I bet she doesn ' t even read to them , " Frank added , beginning a line of speculation about the woman ' s life that would result in a string of 19 separate judgments regarding Nichols ' level of educational attainment , employment status , temper , general ability to make responsible decisions , the cleanliness of her home , and whether her own neglected childhood was simply perpetuating itself in her current behavior toward her kids .While exiting the diner , Nichols reportedly received her final judgment of the day from Terrance Leary , 46 , who , assuming each of Nichols ' children was fathered by a different man , decided that Nichols would likely be open to getting a drink with him . 	 1
James Dyson , Britain ' s answer to Sir Clive Sinclair , has topped his trumps with his latest invention in the personal hygiene market : The Personalised Home Money Sanitiser ." This is a major step forward in cleanliness , " said James Dyson . " We all know that money is dirty . There ' s a phrase : dirty money . That ' s where it comes from . Money that is filthy . "The personalised home money sanitiser solves this age old problem of filthy lucre by providing a quick , efficient way of laundering money ." Money changes hands a lot , " said Dyson . " Who knows how many times that coin has fallen on the floor , been in a pocket with bacteria laden sweets , sucked by a small child with horrendous diseases or used as a makeshift screwdriver to unblock a chemical toilet ? Additionally , notes are just as bad , with every note in circulation having detectable traces of cocaine on them , this gives an indication of the kind of disgusting past our money has . "The personalised home money sanitiser will be a boon for food shops ." Many food shops require their staff to wear gloves while handling food , " said Dyson . " But how many take off the gloves when taking money off customers ? Very few , let me tell you . I can virtually guarantee that the money you give them is more disease laden than their hands . They then touch food with those gloves . I ' ve stopped buying pasties since I found this out . "The sanitiser is very easy to use . Money is put inside , it ' s switched on , and fifteen minutes later , it is sterile ." We ' re expecting it to be a big seller , " said Dyson . " It ' s initial price is 99 . 99 . At first we expect OCD suffers to be the major purchasers , but as demand increases , which we ' re sure it will , the price will fall . " 	 1
LOS ANGELES The new made for television movie A Just Killing the inspiring true story of a man who finds his own inner strength by murdering his needy , overbearing wife premiered on Lifetime for Men this past Saturday , earning the network its highest ever ratings .The highly anticipated movie event is another boon for the cable channel , which specializes in uplifting programming geared toward 30 to 60 year old men . The film chronicles the painful ordeal of Gary Mulkeen , a fun loving mechanic who meets a seemingly perfect woman , but must soon fight for his very life after she reveals herself to be a clingy , manipulative shrew ." It ' s about one man ' s perseverance against impossible odds , " said director Tom Dunlop , whose previous credits include the Lifetime for Men original films Suffocated Independence and Not With My Hard Earned Money You Won ' t . " Hopefully Gary ' s struggle will inspire other men out there to empower themselves and stand up to frigid women who attempt to micromanage every last minute of their lives . "Early word from viewers has been overwhelmingly positive . Many particularly praised the chilling scene in which Mulkeen , played by actor Steven Weber , is viciously browbeaten by his wife into admitting he has been having an affair ." I found Gary Mulkeen ' s harrowing true life experience to be incredibly moving , " viewer Richard Downey said . " Here ' s a guy who journeyed deep into the heart of marital exasperation and came out the other side a stronger , newly single person . Finally , a movie that tells his side of the story . "Audiences have also responded enthusiastically to the film ' s suspenseful climax , in which Mulkeen narrowly escapes his wife ' s nagging clutches by throttling her to death in order to save himself from going out to yet another French restaurant ." I was touched by the moment when Gary realized he could murder his controlling wife , get away with it , and go on to lead a normal , happy life on his own , " Lifetime for Men devotee Gary Zander said . " A life free of shrill accusations and neediness , where he might one day enjoy multiple exciting lovers at once and choose to spend all of his income on classic muscle cars . "" Plus , it worked out that he got all the life insurance money , which was awesome , " Zander added .Lifetime for Men debuted the original television movie as part of its spring schedule . Other programs in the new lineup include the weekly drama series A Life Unburdened , starring Treat Williams as a man who enjoys a series of meaningless sexual encounters and then dies rich and happy , and the hit Catching Up , in which two old college friends get together to drink cheap beer and eat sandwiches for 60 minutes ." At Lifetime for Men , we strive to create programming that reflects the unique problems and issues confronting today ' s man , " said Lifetime for Men president and CEO Fred Rasmussen . " We like to think of it as sort of an entertainment roundtable , wherein we can finally address some of the frustrations that have been holding men back and keeping them from realizing their desire to do absolutely anything they want . "Rasmussen reported that production has already begun on a sequel to A Just Killing , which follows Mulkeen as he summons the courage to leave his dead wife ' s demanding sister after she becomes overly attached following their fifth night of sex together . 	 1
NEW YORK The widespread outrage over two straight years of largely white Oscar nominees coalesced behind three damning , viral words : OscarsSoWhite . The hashtag , which activist April Reign is credited with creating , lent social media unity to a tide of frustration that led to diversity changes announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ." Although we are encouraged by today ' s news , change must still be made , " says Reign , who still plans to rally viewers in boycotting the Feb . 28 broadcast . " The nominees are still the same as they were a week ago . "The actions announced Friday by academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs after a unanimous vote by the academy ' s 51 member Board of Governors were by some measure an uncommonly quick reaction to the crisis that had enveloped the Academy Awards since nominations were announced eight days earlier .But to many of those who have lobbied for change , the academy ' s announcement was seen as just a beginning : a first step in a growing movement for equal opportunity , on movie sets and award show stages , in an industry that lags far behind matching the racial , ethnic , and gender makeup of its moviegoing public ." I applaud their attempts to do something about it , " said Don Cheadle , who was nominated for best actor in 2005 for his performance in Hotel Rwanda . " But , again , this is dealing with the symptom , not starting at the root cause of how we even get to results like this , which has to do with inclusion and access and the ability for people of color , women , and minorities to get at entry level positions where you can become someone who can green light a movie . "To infuse an overwhelmingly white , male , and older academy with more diverse members who might be drawn to more varied nominees , the academy ' s Board of Governors voted to require that member voting status ( previously a lifetime honor ) be reviewed every 10 years , that the board add three seats to be filled by Boone Isaacs , and that traditional member recruitment be expanded in a global campaign to boost diversity . The academy ' s goal is to double the number of women and minorities by 2020 , though it has not disclosed its current demographic makeup .Those changes which the academy boasted were " sweeping " and " historic " were received by many as necessary updates for an institution that the Los Angeles Times in 2012 found is 94 percent white and 77 percent male . But most who cheered the move emphasized a longer , ongoing struggle .Ava DuVernay , director of last year ' s best picture nominee Selma , called the academy ' s announcement " one good step in a long , complicated journey for people of color and women artists . "Chaz Ebert , publisher of RogerEbert . com and wife of the late critic , said : " The academy took the first step . Now let ' s have the studios , the production companies , agencies , unions , and financiers follow suit for diversity . "Cameron Bailey , the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival where many Oscar campaigns are launched praised the academy ' s " impressive , bold action " but added : " Studios , you ' re next . "Whether the academy can shift the focus onto the larger industry will be challenging . Thanks to the last two years of nominees , the Oscars have absorbed the lion ' s share of the spotlight on diversity .Boone Isaacs , the academy ' s first African American president , will also have to contend with the concerns of older members , whose academy membership will flip to " emeritus " status if they are no longer active in the industry at the time of their review . But active is an imprecise , potentially fraught term in a Hollywood where even the most successful players can go years without a project getting off the ground .In an email to membership , Boone Isaacs sought to assure that even " emeritus " members will still receive annual for your consideration screeners from studios usually seen as the most enviable perk of academy membership .There is historical precedent for Boone Isaac ' s efforts to change the academy ' s membership . In the late 1960s , then president Gregory Peck led a purge of older , inactive members in a bid to make the academy younger and more in touch with a changing culture . 	 0
LONDON , England Few racing fans will forget the day Frankie Dettori stormed into the history books as the first man to take seven winners past the post on a seven race card .Frankie Dettori performs his signature " flying dismount " after winning all seven races at Ascot , September 28 , 1996 .It happened in the summer of 1996 at Royal Ascot , the British racecourse founded in 1711 by Queen Anne who considered it the ideal place for " horses to gallop at full stretch . "And gallop he did seizing seven wins from seven races . The win sent a tremor of excitement through the racing industry , made a hero of the small man from Sardinia and stripped ashen faced bookmakers of millions ." I think that the bookmakers lost in the region of 50 million , 100 million , in today ' s money , so history was made , " Frankie Dettori recalls ." We ' ve been racing thoroughbreds for 300 years and I ' m the first one to get there , and good luck to the guy who follows me . "Few think that anyone will . The odds on him winning the straight set were 25 , 095 to one .Millions watched his victory in the stands and on television the BBC ' s Grandstand cut into its traditional Saturday afternoon sports coverage to show the pictures live from Ascot .Ray Cochrane , Dettori ' s friend and manager , had the rare pleasure of watching the drama unfold in front of him , literally ." I was actually riding that day . Everybody wanted to beat him on that last race , " Cochrane says ." He was making the run and going flat out . We thought this horse can ' t keep going , he ' s got 10 stone top weight he can ' t keep going . " But he did ." Then we start to hear this roar , from Swindly Bottom , a mile from home . You could then hear the crowd from the grandstand starting to shout they were just lifting him home . "Among the crowd was Nick Smith , head of public relations for Ascot racecourse ." The atmosphere in the winners ' enclosure was amazing . We actually had champagne for him after the sixth , and then after the seventh the whole place just erupted . " hear more of Nick Smith ' s memories of that day" We abused him after the race , covered him in champagne , gave him a good hiding , " recalls Cochrane . " It was a great day , a great day for racing really , never mind just him . " hear more from Ray Cochrane on Frankie ' s featFrankie Dettori ' s historic win was splashed across the papers . His multiple victories became known as the " Magnificent 7 . " Headlines declared Frankie " untouchable " and a " turf act to follow . "" Frankie was already a well known jockey before the Magnificent 7 , but it did turn him into a household name , " he says .Frankie Dettori is under no illusions as to who ' s to credit for his win and the fame that ' s followed .The horse who took him first past the post for the seventh time that day is now long retired and spends his days grazing in the grounds of Dettori ' s home in the traditional British racing town of Newmarket ." This is Fujiyama Crest , " Dettori says , holding a feed bucket to the nose of an aging gelding ." He was owned by a Japanese owner and then after that he went into jumping but he wasn ' t very good . "" I bought him in private and now he ' s our house pet . I ride him from time to time , my wife , the kids . . . but he spends most of his life in the field with the other ponies . "The famous post is not far away either ." After winning the seven races and all those big races I won at Ascot I asked if I could have it , and they said yes , so after the last race of the last meeting at Ascot I took it off the ground and I put it in the horse box and I planted it here . "It now has pride of place in his garden . " I ' m very proud of it , " he says . " It ' s a bit tall but it ' s got a meaning to it . "In 2001 , Ascot erected its own monument to Frankie Dettori a lifesize bronze statue of the jockey at the entrance to the famous racecourse . more on Frankie Dettori ' s statue at Ascot" Every time I pass by it just reminds me what an achievement that was , " he says . 	 0

" i wouldn't agree with their ruling, but that would be the law of the land that we would have to follow until it's somehow reversed either by a future supreme court, or a u. s. constitutional amendment, which i don't think is realistic or foreseeable, " he said. he said he expects the question " is ultimately going to find its way to the u. s. supreme court, " noting that many federal courts have recently issued rulings overturning state bans on gay marriage. indeed, many court watchers expect the supreme court to take up a case on that very issue this month, and potentially deliver a ruling this spring. that prospect, and the end of florida's same sex marriage ban this week, have brought the issue back into the national spotlight and sparked a fresh debate within the republican party over gay marriage, which the party's social conservative base staunchly opposes. former florida gov. jeb bush, who is preparing for a potential run for president, offered a careful statement respecting the decision for the florida development. but the senator, who is contemplating a presidential run of his own, said he would respect federal courts'decisions to overturn gay marriage bans. " my position on gay marriage is pretty well known. i mean, i believe that the institution of marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman. i understand that voters in some states have changed that, and i respect it, " he said. " and, you know, we have a court system that's beginning to weigh in and whatever the law is, we're going to abide by it and respect it. " but his tuesday comments came in contrast to remarks he made in a speech at catholic university in july defending state legislatures'and voters'rights to oppose gay marriage without judicial interference. " americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have a right to work to keep traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge, " he said, according to politico. the florida senator clarified during his wednesday phone conversation that he felt his remarks did not constitute a shift from his july speech that while he felt the court was mistaken, the state's officials had no option but to abide by it. " i think the court's decision is wrong, both on legal principles, and i also think it's the wrong way to " reverse florida's gay marriage ban, which was approved by voters in 2008. he said the proper way to overturn a gay marriage ban is to offer an opposing ballot measure for the state's voters to again consider. but he added : " i don't think florida's clerks have a choice, at this stage, given that the ruling is there unless there's a stay, " to follow the court's decision and issue marriage licenses. rubio said if ultimately the supreme court issued a ruling protecting gay marriage as constitutional, opponents of gay marriage would be " in the same boat as opponents of roe v. wade, " the scotus decision that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. the controversy surrounding the issue underscores the tension inherent in the republican party's efforts to expand outreach beyond the gop's traditional base of social conservatives, as the nation as a whole moves towards widespread acceptance of gay marriage and more state legislatures overturn gay marriage bans. it's likely to become a hot button issue in the gop presidential primary as contenders jockey to differentiate themselves in what's expected to be a wide open field. bush's recent announcement that he's " actively exploring " a bid is expected to dissuade some from entering the race, and his launch this week of a leadership pac and super pac heightened speculation over his bid. many expect that if bush runs, rubio, who shares much of bush's political circle in florida, won't but the senator said tuesday it won't impact his decision. " there'll be multiple people running for president. they're all going to build organizations and raise money, " he said, noting that if bush runs he'll be a " very formidable candidate. " but he added : " i think once someone makes a decision and that's what they want to do to serve our country, you do that irrespective of who else might be in the race. " " no one's decision would have a bearing on whether i decide whether that's where i want to serve or not not just his, " rubio continued. rubio has the unusual challenge of deciding whether to run for reelection to the senate or for president in 2016. if he does decide to launch a presidential bid, he'll likely face stiff competition from a number of his colleagues in the senate, including sens. ted cruz and rand paul, both of whom have 	 0
the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs may not be correct, according to a new study. a team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. it suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. uk researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago ( illustration shown ). they found the heat near the impact site in mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material. a heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alightthe team of researchers from the university of exeter, university of edinburgh and imperial college london recreated the immense energy that would have been released from the asteroid impact 66 million years ago. they found that the intense but short lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants, challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms. these firestorms have previously been considered a major contender in the puzzle to find out what caused the mass extinction of life on earth 66 million years ago. the impact site is believed to be the 125 mile ( 200km ) wide chicxulub crater buried underneath the yucat n peninsula in mexico. for years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. but last year, a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of'colossal bad luck '. dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, scientists said. but when the six mile wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. the study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the university of edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from north america. they found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs'food chain when disaster struck. if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study. a heat pulse in the surrounding the area lasted for less than a minute followed the impact. while this was too short to ignite live plant material nearby, the effects of the impact further away could have been sufficient to set some material alight. the researchers said as far away as new zealand, the heat would have been less intense but longer lasting, heating the ground for seven minutes enough to ignite live plant matter. but nearer the site such a scenario was unlikely, pouring water on the global firestorm theory. the experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants including green pine branches, typically don't.'by combining computer simulations of the impact with methods from engineering we have been able to recreate the enormous heat of the impact in the laboratory,'said dr claire belcher from the earth system science group in geography at the university of exeter.'this has shown us that the heat was more likely to severely affect ecosystems a long distance away, such that forests in new zealand would have had more chance of suffering major wildfires than forests in north america that were close to the impact.'this flips our understanding of the effects of the impact on its head and means that paleontologists may need to look for new clues from fossils found a long way from the impact to better understand the mass extinction event.'the experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants typically don't. pictured is the fire propagation apparatus recreating the impact induced thermal pulse at the cretaceous palaeogene ( k pg ) boundary. halogen lamps are delivering the thermal radiation in the imagefurther away from the impact site in mexico ( shown ), in places like new zealand, the heat could have lasted up to seven minutes and caused some localised fires. but the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid impact is not correct, according to the scientistsplants and animals are generally resistant to localised fire events animals can hide or hibernate and plants can re colonise from other areas, implying that wildfires are unlikely to be directly capable of leading to the extinctions. if, however, some animal communities particularly large animals were unable to shelter from the heat, they may have suffered serious losses. it is unclear whether these would have been sufficient to lead to the extinction of species.'this is a truly exciting piece of inter disciplinary research,'said dr rory hadden from the university of edinburgh.'by working together engineers and geoscientists have tackled a complex, long standing problem in a novel way.'this has allowed a step forward in the debate surrounding the end cretaceous impact and will help geosc 	 0
when i was at cia or nsa, my public affairs staff would sometimes enlist me to intervene with an editor to stop the publication of what we viewed to be classified information. i would invariably begin the conversation with the journalist by pointing out that i knew that, " we both have a job to do protect american security and liberty, but how you're about to do yours is going to make it harder for me to do mine. " that introduction reflected my true feelings, so like most americans i am conflicted about the current row over protecting press freedom and protecting national secrets. let me be clear. the two prominent cases being debated were indeed serious leaks, because they touched upon sources, not just information. in the case of the associated press report on a yemen based bomb plot, the source had apparently penetrated an al qaeda network and there were hopes that he could continue to be exploited. in the fox news report on north korea's intention to test a nuclear weapon, james rosen told us not just that the united states judged that pyongyang would respond to impending sanctions with a test. he pointedly added that a source in north korea had told us so. these kinds of stories get people killed. while at cia i recounted to a group of news bureau chiefs that, when an agency presence in a denied area had been revealed in the media, two assets had been detained and executed. the cia site there wrote : " regret that we cannot address this loss of life with the person who decided to leak our mission to the newspapers. " and, since the yemen source appears to have actually been recruited by a liaison partner, the impact of a leak goes far beyond our own service. in that same talk with bureau chiefs, i pointed out that several years before 9 11, one chief of station reported that a press leak of liaison intelligence had " put us out of the ( osama ) bin laden reporting business ". in both stories, investigations were in order. journalists, of all people, should understand the need to protect sources and relationships. but the investigations have been very aggressive and the acquisition of journalists'communications records has been broad, invasive, secret and one suspects unnecessary. a quick survey of former bush administration colleagues confirmed my belief that a proposal to sweep up a trove of ap phone records or james rosen's e mails would have had a half life of about 30 seconds in that administration. and, although rosen seems to have worked his source with tradecraft and elicitation techniques more reminiscent of a case officer than a press conference, charges of co conspiracy and flight risk are quite a stretch. if this had been a predator strike rather than an investigation, we would have judged the target ( leaks and leakers ) to have been legitimate, but the collateral damage ( squeezing the first amendment and chilling legitimate press activity ) to have been prohibitive. which brings me back to being conflicted and to a sense of resignation that this legitimate free press legitimate government secrets thing is a condition we will have to manage, not a problem that we will solve. when the press decides to publish something that the government considers classified, it is assuming for itself an inherently governmental function. and as david ignatius once pointed out, " we journalists usually try to argue that we have carefully weighed the pros and cons and believe that the public benefit of disclosure outweighs any potential harm. the problem is that we aren't fully qualified to make those judgments. " true enough, but no one who has served in government would claim that the public release of every document marked with a classification stamp would actually harm american security. over classification is common. government confuses things further with controlled releases of formerly classified data for both policy and political reasons. so many anonymous government officials have commented on drones and targeted killings in recent years that i told a senate committee last summer that i simply did not know what of my personal knowledge of those programs i could or could not publicly discuss. if there exists a body of information that can fairly be labeled " publicly known but still officially classified, " the protection of truly secret data will be eroded. when lines are not bright, it is more likely that even well intentioned people will end up on the wrong side of them. the problem promises to get harder, not easier. while at cia i asked my civilian advisory board to consider whether america would be able to conduct espionage in the future within a political culture that seemed to every day demand more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life. they weren't optimistic. beyond this cultural trend, modern technology arms inquisitive journalists with powerful tools to gather and link disparate data, to turn what were once globally dispersed shards of glass into revealing mosaics. many things intended to be secret, like the airlift of croatian weapons to syria, simply don't stay that way. so, how do we limit the damage? well, journalists will have to expand the kind of sensitivities to the 	 0
HOLLYWOOD Lions Face Pictures in association with TouchRock Films has just announced that production will soon begin on the motion picture Oops The Officer John " Pepper Spray ' Pike Story .The movie will feature John Goodman in the starring role and will be filmed in 3D and Smell O Vision and will be directed by the award winning director Bandini Borrapelli .The main part of the movie will be filmed on the campus of Gatorade College in Ocala , Florida , which has a tremendous resemblance to the University of California at Davis down to the orange trees , grapefruit trees , lemon trees , and the 21 foot tall bronze statue of the 13th U . S . president Millard Fillmore .Borrapelli said that the film will begin with little 6 year old Johnny Pike shown sitting around his family ' s Christmas tree and as his older sister opens up a present Johnny for some unexplained reason reaches over , grabs the ribbon , and eats it .In one scene Pike is in his family ' s backyard sitting on his red tricycle with a BB gun shooting unsuspecting grasshoppers , crickets , and gnats .Pike will also be shown at the age of nine when he allegedly threatened to kidnap his own grandmother because she told him to quit spitting on her cat .At the age of 14 , Johnny took a liking to one of the neighborhood girls , who quickly rejected him after he told her that he wanted to kiss her cowlick .As Johnny grew older he became a big fan of Barry Manilow . In fact Pike has every album and single that Manilow ever recorded and he even nicknamed his wife " Mandy " after the Manilow hit of the 70s .Borrapelli said that as soon as he was offered the movie that he picked John Goodman to play the lead . He said that he wanted Rosanne Barr to play Pike ' s wife but she was busy gathering macadamia nuts in Hawaii and so he decided on casting former Wilson Phillips singer Carnie Wilson in her place .He said that his first and only choice to play the highly accented University Chancellor Linda Katehi was the highly accented Arianna Huffington who readily agreed to take the part .Borrapelli said that the film will have an R rating due to explicit language , suggestive mannerisms , provocative clothing , and symptomatic ipso facto . 	 1
charlotte, nc friends of 33 year old matt breunich quietly observed the 10th anniversary of his lower back problem, a chronic condition that has served as an ongoing reason to excuse himself from such diverse activities as taking out the trash, helping friends move, and making love to his girlfriend. " no matter what's going on, you can always count on matt's slipped disc to act up, " said longtime friend janet wolck, who joined 13 others in an evening of reminiscence at a local restaurant tuesday. " it's been one heck of an excuse laden decade. " according to gathering organizer tony kairns, it was in april 1996 that breunich first revealed the existence of a herniated disc in his lower back when declining at the last minute to help a group of friends move into their first off campus home. " while we've never verified the exact date of the alleged injury, everyone agrees that that was the first time they heard the excuse, " said kairns, who has known breunich since they were college freshman roommates 12 years ago. " everyone was so concerned because it sounded serious. none of us suspected the excuse would last this long. " in that time, breunich has used the slipped disc excuse a number of times estimated by friends to be between one and three zillion. it has served as breunich's ticket out of stripping paint, attending a coworker's going away party, changing a tire, holding a friend's baby, setting up a tent, conveying pitchers of beer from the bar to an awaiting table, making a bed, vacuuming, retrieving an escaped guinea pig, shoveling snow, kissing the blarney stone, cleaning out a garage, and going on approximately 14 second dates. even as friends'concern over the injury gradually grew into bemusement, then indifference, the excuse persisted. ex girlfriend lauren vargas marveled at its longevity, saying that as recently as february, breunich " trotted out the old chestnut " when asked to deliver canned goods to a local homeless shelter. " it's fun to feed him terms like'torn lumbar region'and'bone chips'and so on, " vargas said, " then watch him find a way to incorporate them into the excuse next time around. " " does your back need to be in peak condition in order to watch a pro basketball game? " said charlotte bobcats fan kyle lagrange, echoing the evening's trend of rhetorical questioning. though no one has been able to determine whether breunich ever truly slipped a disc, kairns said he felt especially privileged to " be on the scene " when the excuse transformed from a casual complaint about his lower back to a full blown prolapsed vertebra. breunich told kairns that a first year medical student he had met at a bar said that his back pain might be due to a slipped disc. " i don't think he's ever seen a doctor or a chiropractor about it, " kairns said. " you'd think that he would, with all that pain and apparent immobility. " despite his unwillingness to consult the medical establishment, breunich remains attentive to his condition, often requiring the most comfortable chair in a given room " for his back, " according to kairns. though admitting they had no specific knowledge, breunich's friends were fairly certain that modern medicine had devised treatments for the condition, with a few guessing that proper care and bedrest could allow slipped discs to mend on their own. some were also baffled by the injury's versatility, specifically its ability to travel from the lower back to the neck region. jeff lewis, who works with breunich at a charlotte area data recovery firm, noted that back complaints disappear during activities breunich enjoys, including company softball games, where he is the team's leading hitter and hasn't missed a game in four years. " that can't be good for his back, " lewis said. " but i guess he fights through the pain, like he must when he's hunched over playing quake 4 for hours on end. " when coworker dave amato added that breunich had recently complained of possible carpal tunnel syndrome, excusing him from three major projects, it inspired lively speculation from the group about a new era of potential injuries. " this has the potential to be a real'stealth excuse'for matt, " lewis said. " there are times when a headache or a backache just isn't appropriate, and i'm sure those will be exactly the times when his carpal tunnel will flare up. " breunich was invited to the gathering, but 	 1
According to a spokesperson for Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey , the candidate for the 016 presidential election is sleeping less while consuming more bedside emergency oatmeal cookies than usual during long wakeful periods .The George Washington bridge scandal has led some observers to feel the governor was strangely absent from what was going on back in September , when three access lanes to the bridge were reduced to one and caused the worst traffic jam since 9 11 .This " absence " of the governor , in terms of his noticing what was going on at the time or commenting on it until later as the scandal developed , has led to the governor ' s troubled nights .At one rare point of actually sleeping , and dreaming he was on the bridge looking over the side , he was aroused by a strange high pitched little sound , plus somehow it was musical , with lyricsOh ! and the waters belowdraw me close to the edgeOh !Fretting on it all , including wishing the public would forget all about the scandal by March , so he could get on with his presidential ambitions , Mr Christie was suddenly aware of the source of the music and the troubling lyrics .He sat bolt upright the music and lyrics were whistling out of his own nose !In what may be a ploy to soften irritation with the governor and bring a sense of mercy and empathy from future voters , Mr Christie ' s spokesperson indicated there was a further stanza :Oh ! and the waters belowshall I go , shall I go ? Oh !At this point Mr Christie was assailed with a horrible vision so that he could no longer keep to his bed .He had just dreamed of actually leaping from the George Washington Bridge in a magnificent gesture of contrition to a terrible result .Like Walt Disney ' s cartoon character Humphrey the Bear he had merely smacked into the waters without sinking an inch , and was then floating on his back under the bridge !This humiliation was compounded when his leaping and consequent failure to sink caused a traffic jam threatening to outdo the earlier one in September .People he particularly noticed children were leaning over the sides of the bridge waving and laughing at him down below .Leaving his bed in a hurry he repaired to the kitchen to find further sustenance and ward off the horror of this nightmare , and what it might mean for his political ambitions . 	 1
Los Angeles , California Britney Spears accused a former bodyguard of trying to " make a name for himself " by suing her for sexual harassment .Fernando Flores , who worked for the pop star earlier this year , filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Wednesday claiming Spears intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him .The lawsuit claims Spears made " repeated unwanted sexual advances " on Flores , had " vigorous " sex in front of him and near her two children and violently argued with her boyfriend .A statement posted on Spears ' website said the suit was " another unfortunate situation where someone is trying to take advantage of the Spears family and make a name for himself . "Spears said the California Department of Children and Family Services already investigated the accusations and closed the case without any action ." Ms . Spears and her attorneys have every expectation that this matter will be dismissed by the courts , " her statement saidThe filing said the harassment began after Flores was hired as a guard at her Calabasas , California home last February by Advanced Security Concepts Corporation .Spears made " repeated unwanted sexual advances to Plaintiff , summoning Plaintiff to her room at her residence for no other purpose or reason that to expose her naked or near naked body to Plaintiff , " the suit claimed .Flores was " shocked and disgusted by the incident , " it said .When he reported it to his supervisor , Flores was told " You know you liked it , " and his complaints were " ignored or mocked , " it said .Spears allegedly " engaged in numerous sex acts in front of Plaintiff , including but not limited to sexual intercourse .

House Benghazi Committee Chairman Rep . Trey Gowdy , R S . C . , left , talks with the committee s ranking member Rep . Elijah Cummings , D Md . on Capitol Hill in Washington , Thursday , Oct . 22 , 2015 , prior to the start of the committee s hearing on Benghazi . After months . . . moreDemocrats on the Benghazi special committee criticized the panel Thursday for planning a trip to Europe as part of their investigation ? an announcement Republicans said jeopardizes the safety of the lawmakers who will be traveling overseas to investigate .Meanwhile on Thursday , Fox News reported that the FBI has expanded its probe of Hillary Rodham Clinton s emails , looking into whether the former secretary of state lied to federal investigators trying to ensure that issues surrounding the Benghazi attacks had been thoroughly investigated and open records requests by Congress and citizens groups complied with .Democrats on the Benghazi committee , who have dismissed it a partisan sham for months , said the trip is going to be lavish and expensive , and will include Italy and other European destinations .SEE ALSO : Hillary declares victory over Benghazi panel , pivots to bash Planned Parenthood witch huntThe cost of the trip was unclear , but Democrats said the overall price tag for the Benghazi probe has now topped 5 million .In the 11 hour marathon hearing with Secretary Clinton , Republicans showed the world that the Benghazi Select Committee is a taxpayer funded fishing expedition to derail Secretary Clinton s presidential campaign ? and that their net came up empty , said Rep . Elijah E . Cummings , Maryland Democrat and the committee s ranking member . The Republicans will never resuscitate the credibility of this committee , and they certainly won t do so by traveling to Italy on the taxpayers dime .The GOP countered by saying Democrats are the ones wasting taxpayer money by doing everything they can to undermine the committee s work .SEE ALSO : Clinton State Department approved U . S . weapons shipment to Libya despite banThese politically motivated Democrats have now sunk to a new low by disregarding the safety and security of members of Congress traveling to military and intelligence centers overseas , committee spokesman Matt Wolking said .If they truly don t understand the relevance of AFRICOM and military facilities potentially assigned to respond to terrorist attacks on America s diplomatic outposts , that only demonstrates their own willful ignorance and lack of interest in gathering all the information necessary to complete this serious and thorough investigation , he said .Mr Wolking also said committee Democrats are obsessed with defending Mrs Clinton .She testified before the panel last month in an 11 hour hearing , and continues to face questions over the private email server she chose to set up out of her home while serving as the nation s top diplomat .Citing intelligence sources familiar with the ongoing case , Fox News reported Thursday that the FBI is exploring whether multiple statements violate a federal false statements statute .Fox News is told agents are looking at U . S . Code 18 , Section 1001 , which pertains to materially false statements given either in writing , orally or through a third party . Violations also include pressuring a third party to conspire in a cover up . Each felony violation is subject to five years in prison , said the report by Catherine Herridge .The statute raises the same issues that landed Martha Stewart a federal prison term in an insider trading probe , according to Fox .Nearly seven in 10 voters said they think Mrs Clinton did something either unethical or illegal when she set up the system to conduct government business , according to a new McClatchy Marist poll .The State Department is making monthly releases of Mrs Clinton s emails , and many of them have been retroactively labeled classified . She testified to the panel that there was nothing marked classified on her emails , either sent or received . 	 0

WASHINGTON As the federal government shutdown stretches into its fourth day , 20 members of the Republican ' s Tea Party faction announced this morning they would be willing to support a clean budget resolution bill in exchange for the president ' s firstborn daughter , Malia Obama .While members of the Republican Party ' s far right wing have heretofore been resistant to any sort of deal with the White House over the issue of Obamacare , the Tea Party caucus authored and released a short , tersely worded statement this morning in which they agreed to a swift negotiation of an unstipulated spending bill if the president were to deliver " the firstling . "" The girl . Bring us the girl , " said Congressman Steve King ( R IA ) as he stood beside fellow Tea Party leaders during this morning ' s press conference on the steps of the Capitol . " The bill may pass , but the firstborn shall be ours . "" Heed our bidding , " added an unblinking Phil Gingrey ( R GA ) . " And thy wish shall be granted . "According to Washington insiders , the deal would reportedly feature a continuing resolution to fund government operations through November 15 without any modifications to the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 , including implementation of the individual mandate and the much maligned tax on medical devices , while Malia Obama would legally fall under the protectorship of the Tea Party caucus .White House officials have declined to comment .According to Congressional aides , if the White House agrees to deliver Malia , as well as a pint of Michelle Obama ' s blood , a ram ' s horn , and a shard of obsidian to the basement of the Cannon House Office Building by this evening , a House vote on the bill could take place as early as Saturday ." Obamacare may be a scourge , but lo , our eyes are cast upon matters of greater import , " explained Tea Party Republican Justin Amash of Michigan ' s third district . " Preparations must be made . The hour is nigh . "While some political analysts argued the surprise announcement suggests a weakening in resolve of the faction , opening the door for further movement on their stance , several Republican staffers have already indicated that the caucus will not negotiate on their declared terms and that any attempts to substitute Sasha for Malia will be fruitless ." It must be Malia , " stated Mick Mulvaney ( R SC ) . " First of birth . First of blood . First of the reckoning . "Experts added that in addition to limiting the damage of the current government shutdown , the deal could also avoid a protracted and dangerous battle over raising the nation ' s debt ceiling in the coming weeks if members of the Tea Party determine Malia has fulfilled the prophecy ." The Tea Party has spoken , " said Georgetown professor of political science Richard Drape . " The deal has been wrought . All bear witness to the fruits of the Great Compromise , for it is with us . "At press time , a teary eyed Michelle Obama was informing Malia that she will always love her . 	 1
( EW . com ) The latest name thrown in the ring for an " X Factor " judges spot : Singer LeAnn Rimes .Sources say Rimes is interested in joining the Fox reality hit , with one source adding that she ' s met with " Factor " co producer FremantleMedia North America about the gig and other opportunities ." X Factor " chief Simon Cowell is seeking to fill the judges panel spots vacated by Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger before the second season starts production later this year . Sources say he ' ll most likely hire two female talents to join himself and music producer L . A . Reid for a gender balanced panel .Cowell has not made firm offers for the posts , the list of candidates continue to shift and official outlets continue to decline comment . But Rimes could make sense on a few levels for " X Factor . " First , she would add country music expertise , like Blake Shelton provides for NBC ' s " The Voice . " That could also boost the show ' s ratings since country music award shows have been one of the few TV genres to have successfully grown their audience in recent years . Rimes also knows what it ' s like to compete in a TV talent competition , she first gained national attention when she was eight years old by becoming a finalist on Star Search in 1991 . Plus , Rimes ' personal life , marriage to Eddie Cibrian and weight issues while polarizing have also drawn plenty of headlines , which would spur press coverage of the show .Rimes performed a tearful tribute at a concert last week to Whitney Houston , who Cowell considered for an " X Factor " gig before her death on February 11 .Other names circulating for " X Factor " posts include singers ranging from Vanessa Hudgens to Britney Spears .Cowell , Fremantle and Fox declined comment , but you can expect more " X Factor " judges news later today .

NEW YORK According to a new study published Wednesday in The American Educational Research Journal , an overwhelming majority of recent college graduates are completely unprepared to carry the full weight of the U . S . economic recovery .The study , conducted by researchers at Columbia University , confirmed that a drastically high number of 22 to 24 year olds lack even the most fundamental skills necessary to singlehandedly spark unbridled economic growth across the entire country for generations to come ." Our findings indicate that many college graduates do not receive an education that adequately prepares them for turning around years of economic malaise and fostering a bold new era of American prosperity , " said Dr Jason Fields , lead author of the report . " Even at elite colleges , most students leave school without a strong enough grasp on how to totally revitalize the manufacturing , housing , automotive , and health care industries of an entire country . "" Simply put , American academic institutions are failing to equip their students with the tools to swiftly erase trillions of dollars of national debt , " Fields added . " In fact , most of them aren ' t even able to save the vanishing middle class . "Fields explained to reporters that in critical areas such as driving nationwide consumer spending , boosting the country ' s GDP , and returning the U . S . to the forefront of international trade , today ' s college graduates are floundering . Statistics show over 90 percent of American college graduates lack the skills required to create millions of jobs through a total restructuring of the nation ' s infrastructure and energy grid , 78 percent lack the technical knowledge to turn around struggling small businesses throughout the nation , and an alarming 97 percent are severely underprepared to dramatically improve the deteriorating standards of living for the middle and lower classes .In addition , the study found that the vast majority of undergraduate college curricula contain little to no courses on subjects such as completely turning around a moribund financial system or paying off a seemingly insurmountable accumulation of debt to China ." Many students emerge with their four year college degrees unable to tackle even basic problems such as undoing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , " said Fields , adding that those who graduated as far back as 2007 still struggle to inject billions of dollars into the federal government . " They literally have no idea how to implement sustainable models of widespread financial stability for millions of American families in a short amount of time , and that is unacceptable . "Fields stressed that the failure of recent college graduates to create a new wave of multi billion dollar companies capable of bolstering both the private and public sectors ultimately falls on educators ." College professors have a responsibility to make sure their pupils are ready to immediately dig the entire United States out from the brink of financial ruin a responsibility that they are , sadly , not taking seriously enough , " Fields concluded . " Also , if they could figure out a way to teach recent college graduates how to reverse climate change too , that would be super helpful . " 	 1
ALHAMBRA , CA Area crazy man Dennis Fife held a press conference Tuesday to announce that on Oct . 8 , he will stand in the doorway of the office building at 2600 Kenilworth Avenue and yell at cars all day .Addressing reporters , the 47 year old Fife said , " At approximately 9 : 30 a . m . on the day in question , shortly after I finish lunging at dogs , I will proceed to the front steps of the Simmons Building and yell loudly for nine hours . The screaming will be broken by a 15 minute fit of rigid catatonia , most likely in the late afternoon . "Among the topics Fife plans to address during his nine hour rant : the ace of diamonds , bookshelves , the man trying to kill him , those goddamn bananas , people from St . Louis , closed up straws , Trapper John , MD , and papers , papers everywhere ." I may briefly stray from my agenda to urinate into the revolving door at the building ' s entrance , " Fife said , " but , for the most part , I will focus on the task at hand and spend the bulk of the day yelling at the various passing cars . "Though Fife said he will shout at any vehicle that goes down Kenilworth Avenue , he will focus primarily on Volkswagen Beetles , pick up trucks and late ' 80s Mitsubishi Galants . Fife also noted that he will attempt to gain the attention of bicyclists by shouting , " Hey there , Mr Bike man . "" A lot of what I intend to yell will be pre planned it will be things I ' ve shouted at cars before , " said Fife , chewing on his right forearm . " But I definitely want to leave open some room for improvisation . For instance , if a red car passes by , I might be inclined to shout at the driver , ' Where ' d you get the fancy red car ? ' But then , if another red car drives by a bit later , I might become angry and demand that the driver stop and give me kidney beans . "Fife has already begun preparations for the event . On Monday , he worked late into the night making a bowl of Kraft macaroni and cheese , which he said he will bring with him and throw into the street , handfuls at a time . He has also set aside his lucky rubberband and a tree branch for the occasion .While Fife has vowed to remain in the office building ' s doorway throughout his nine hour yell session , some observers speculate that he will wander over to the nearest corner , where he would have access to vehicles slowing down to make the turn onto Canyon Drive ." That corner is going to be extremely tempting for Mr Fife , " Alhambra city councilmember Lorraine Schmidt said . " Not only do the cars slow down there , giving him better access to drivers , but there is a mailbox he can spit into . I can ' t imagine he ' ll be able to stand in that doorway all day with the corner in full view without giving in to the urge to go over there . "Alhambra police chief George Jaeger predicted Fife would be successful in his venture , praising his remarkable tenacity and determination ." When Mr Fife sets his mind to something , he does it , " Jaeger said . " Whether it ' s tearing pages out of a phone book , swallowing metal washers , or selling a discarded Roxette CD to an imaginary friend for 600 , every project he undertakes is a bona fide success . This truly is one focused loon . " 	 1
Brady , Patriots fall 20 18 to Broncos in AFC title gameDENVER ( AP ) ? Tom Brady isn ' t perfect . Stephen Gostkowski ? He almost always is .While Brady made the best out of a less than ideal day , the single mistake Gostkowski made ? missing his first extra point in nine years ? played a big role in New England missing out on a trip to the Super Bowl .The Patriots ' reign as the NFL champions ended with a 20 18 loss to Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game Sunday ." At the end , we just couldn ' t make enough plays , " Patriots coach Bill Belichick said . " Disappointing , disappointing result . There ' s such a fine line today between winning and losing . "The NFL wanted to spice things up by moving the extra point back this season . They certainly did at that .With a chance to tie the game early , Gostkowski sent his extra point fluttering off to the right . This from a kicker who made an NFL record 523 consecutive PATs . It put Brady and the offense in chase mode the rest of the way ." I just feel terrible , " Gostkowski said . " All day , these guys put their bodies and lives on the line , and for me to come out here and miss a kick , it ' s a nightmare scenario . I can ' t even explain how I feel right now . It ' s just a complete shock and I let a lot of people down . "Not that his teammates were blaming the right foot of Gostkowski in a game where the Patriots ( 13 5 ) turned the ball over twice on interceptions and two more times on downs ." You definitely shouldn ' t put the heat on him . It ' s a team game , " tight end Rob Gronkowski said . " You can ' t put it on the hands of Steph . There ' s no way . "This was also far from Brady ' s best performance . He was constantly hounded by Denver ' s top ranked defense , especially Von Miller as the linebacker finished with an interception and 2 ? sacks . Brady was 27 of 56 for 310 yards and two interceptions .He led the Patriots on a TD drive in the waning seconds , hitting Gronkowski for a 4 yard score on fourth down . Pulling within two points at 20 18 and 12 seconds left , the Patriots went for the 2 point conversion .Aqib Talib stepped in front of Brady ' s pass and deflected it toward the sky . Bradley Roby made the pick .The Broncos ( 14 4 ) recovered the onside kick and , after a knee by Manning , the celebration began . Manning is now 3 1 against Brady when it has counted the most ? with a spot in the Super Bowl on the line ." I ' m sure everyone can look at different plays throughout the game when it ' s that close and say , ' Man I wish I had made that play , ' " Brady said . " But I ' m proud of the way we fought and we certainly fought to the end . "A big game decided near the goal line ? The Patriots have certainly been in that situation before . They won the Super Bowl a season ago with an interception at the goal line in the final seconds against Seattle .This time , they lost a chance at a return by throwing a pick at the goal line . 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC In a humanitarian relief effort expected to greatly ease the pain of America ' s blighted inner cities , the federal government will begin importing and distributing the wonder drug heroin to the growing urban underclass , President Clinton announced Monday .Citing " the horrible pain of life in America ' s urban centers , " Clinton urged all Americans living below the poverty line to begin using the substance immediately and " forget the daily agonies of your unceasingly horrific lives in a mind numbing rush of glorious , opiate induced oblivion . "" A lighter , a spoon , some cotton balls and a syringe are all America needs to end the misery of poverty forever , " Clinton continued . " Poor people of the nation everywhere dream of a way out of the ghetto , and I am here to tell them : Do not give up on that dream . America , heroin is that way out . "Government officials were unanimous in their support for the president ' s plan ." This stuff is unbelievable we ' re talking 100 percent pure unrefined China White , " U . S . Sen . Trent Lott ( R MS ) said . " Our nation ' s poor are clearly going to be on cloud nine once this ' mainline ' hits the vein . "According to CIA Director John Deutch , no price is too great to pay for injections of the precious substance ." These struggling people won ' t be thinking about anything not poverty , not starvation , not savage , random gang beatings nothing at all but that next sweet , sweet taste , " Deutch said . " What an incredible rush it will be for them . "According to federal studies , the levels of crime , poverty , despair and misery within the nation ' s inner cities have grown so rapidly in recent years as to make survival " an impossibly hopeless task , endurable only through the aid of massive , regular smack injections . "" Once these disenfranchised masses begin to shoot up , they will feel like they can do anything , " said Bruce McCartland , a top Clinton aide . " And I mean anything : get a high paying job , buy a new car , escape the vicious cycle of poverty . You name it when you ' re on the nod , anything seems possible . "The program has the added advantage , said U . S . Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala , of requiring no taxpayer funding , as the substance can be purchased at bulk and sold for a small profit on city streets ." It ' s an extremely cost effective program , " Shalala said . " Once it gets off the ground it will require very little additional funding , as our studies show that the heroin users themselves will be willing to pay for further doses of the substance . Heroin users are wonderfully resourceful and entrepreneurial when it comes to finding the money to purchase drugs . Some even start their own small businesses , such as selling their bodies , or even the drug itself , in order to pay for their next ' fix . ' "As an added bonus , the new program will help foster a strong sense of community within inner cities , as heroin users will likely often be forced to share needles ." There ' s nothing more beautiful , " McCartland said , " than seeing a group of young addicts coming together to pass the needle around . "The latest in a recent string of psychoactive drugs to hit the market , heroin functions much like other commercially available anti depressants , such as Prozac and Zolaft , which have created an unprecedented boom in drug therapy pharmaceuticals in recent years . However , experts say heroin is even more powerful , causing an incredibly pleasurable sensory overload of the central nervous system and creating a near total shutdown of the areas of the brain that register pain ." Zolaft and Prozac have greatly improved the emotional lives of millions of America ' s mildly dissatisfied , upper middle class suburbanites , " said Dr Louis Reed , author of the bestselling Listening To Heroin . " But let ' s face it : Prescribing Prozac to the wretched , world weary human flotsam of the inner cities would be like putting a band aid on a massive head wound . Nothing less than total chemically induced escape from reality will do . Heroin is the way . " 	 1
LONDON , England At London Fashion Week , all eyes are usually on the clothes .Egyptian Azza Fahmy is one of the Arab world ' s preeminent jewelry designersBut the Arab and Islamic influenced brooches , bracelets , necklaces and rings adorning the models heading down Julien Macdonald ' s catwalk are also getting attention .They are part of a collaboration between the fashion powerhouse and former British Designer of the Year and Egyptian jewelry designer , Azza Fahmy .In return , " Azza Fahmy Jewellery " gets international exposure , to the likes of Vanity Fair , The Wall Street Journal and OK ! .But don ' t as one London paper did call the catwalk collection " designer bling . "" It ' s quite a deep and nice collection not bling bling . I hate bling bling collections , " Fahmy exclaims .Starting at 250 to ' the sky ' s the limit ' , Fahmy ' s pioneering blends of gold , silver and precious stones , makes her one of the Arab world ' s preeminent jewelry designers .The only problem is , a mere 30 percent of these ' jewels of the Nile ' are sold outside Egypt Fahmy was missing out on the lucrative Gulf Arab market .One of the challenges of marketing designer jewelry in the Middle East is getting past the traditional mentality that measures an item ' s worth not by exceptional finishes but by its weight in grams and karats .To do well in the East , Fahmy and her daughters Fatma and Amina steered the family business to the West .It started with the Julien Macdonald collaboration , and now exclusive Western stores like Kabiri , Harrods and Harvey Nichols are selling their jewelry .Arabs tend to imitate Western spending habits , paying big money for luxury foreign items like Bulgari or Cartier but they don ' t give the same attention to their own Arab brands .Fahmy believes that as her jewelry becomes popular in the West more Middle Eastern buyers will follow suit .The marketing strategy seems to be working . Her team says the collections now sell in the U . A . E . , Qatar and Bahrain . Next stop Saudi Arabia ." To have a product which stands beside Cartier , etcetera it ' s a challenge . But we are sure of the ourselves because we are presenting something special , something which is different from all these brands , " Fahmy said .At her workshop on the outskirts of Cairo , Fahmy ' s craftsmen work in the belief they ' re turning precious metal into something different art .Fahmy ' s daughter , Amina Ghaly , works for the family business as a designer and says there ' s value in the design , the marketing and workmanship poured into each item ."

i'm a quitter and proud of it. november 20 the 37th anniversary of the great american smokeout marks my 28th anniversary without a " cancer stick. " it was 1986 i was 28 at the time and had smoked a pack a day since i was 15. that's about 95, 000 cigarettes! all these years later, writing that figure still makes me feel sick to my stomach. ( or should i say, lungs? ) the last cigarette : nine ex smokers who quit the habit for goodlike a lot of teenagers in my day, i started smoking in high school. at the time, 1973, it was the cool thing to do and if there was anything i aspired to, cool was it. sucked into the rip tide of popular culture, my juvenile delinquent brain gravitated toward anything that questioned authority or was anti establishmentarian, just like my heroes. too young to go to woodstock, i could still bang out a joan baez tune on my guitar, recite enough lines of allen ginsberg's " howl " to prove i was cooler than cool and buy cigarettes. nobody stopped me. a cigarette dangling from these radical lips was part of the image i had carefully crafted for myself. cancer? didn't give it a thought. and nobody at home mentioned it either. this, despite the fact that neither my mother nor my grandmother, with whom we lived, smoked. the war in vietnam, the protests against it, the music, rowan martin's laugh in, the psychedelic drug scene, feminism and the whole counter culture movement was way more intriguing than president nixon's war on cancer. only old people got cancer. like my dear uncle frank, who died at 48 an astonishingly young age, i later realized of throat cancer, when i was in eighth grade. he started smoking at an even younger age than me. my high school in the suburbs of baltimore had a smoking lounge my junior year, 1975. it was outside the cafeteria, so students could smoke before school and during lunch break. regardless, smoking didn't stop in the bathrooms, and i have plenty of suspensions on my record to prove it. i was addicted. still, i had a responsible side. i worked like a dog at a pizza joint in town and felt i had earned the right to spend my money the way i saw fit. heck, i was bringing home 52 a week and spending less than 3 on my nicotine habit, with cigarettes costing 35 cents a pack. you know you're hooked when, despite being bedridden with a terrible case of strep throat at 17, you're craving a cigarette. or when it's 2 in the morning and you're too tired to drive to 7 11, so you scrounge through all your ashtrays, fishing for a butt with a modicum of tobacco left. or you're with friends and they light up, so you light up because that's just good social courtesy, right? it was pathetic. i started coughing my junior year of college, especially in the morning. i was an english major spending all my free time writing poetry and song lyrics. those marlboros got me through many all nighters, typing papers on sylvia plath, john berryman, edgar allen poe. the drinking age at the time was 18 and the college bar scene was hopping. hell, we were just having fun, were young and invincible and had plenty of time to do " the adult thing " after graduation. i'd quit then. but i didn't. it was 1982 and i had moved to vermont. i netted about 100 a week working at a department store, as the demand for poetry and song writers wasn't what i had hoped. depression and cigarettes made comfortable bedfellows. compared to a lot of things i could be spending my money on, cigarettes were tame and cheaper, i kept telling myself. but a major change was taking place. when i heard that secondhand smoke could harm the people around me, it was hard to swallow. more than two thirds of nonsmokers and half of all smokers believed smoking was hazardous to the health of nonsmokers, according to a 1978 tobacco institute report. i was hurting myself and innocent bystanders. sadly, it didn't matter enough. by 26, i was waking up regularly in a cold sweat, my pulse racing so fast i thought i was having a heart attack. subsequent medical attention ruled out cardiac issues, but a chest x ray revealed some significant " shadows " for a person my age. the doctor clicked his tongue annoyed, " you should give up smoking. it's just not cool. " for two years, i lived with the horrible burden of panic attacks, not knowing what caused them or how to stop them. then one day, in a brilliant moment of clarity, i realized that i was scared to die. i 	 0

New York Distinguished former Congressman Anthony Weiner is testing the waters for a run for mayor , releasing a multi level plan that would return this metropolis to its Fun City roots .For openers , the proposal would bring back the grit and grime of Times Square , and includes funding for the conversion of three theaters there into peep show palaces . " We would also erect more strip clubs throughout the city and remove the lap dance tax so these establishments can again be profitable , " a campaign booklet said .Weiner distinguished himself two years ago by taking pornographic pictures of himself and texting the shots to unsuspecting women . Then he tried to cover up the bizarre behavior with lies that corrupted the integrity of his Congressional office .The resulting uproar cost him his political career , but maybe not . Weiner ' s Fun City plan takes advantage of his experience as a sleaze and digital stalker , offering voters some added value attributes that other candidates simply do not possess ." Qf course , the main objective of this plan is job creation , " the brochure said . " By cleaning up Times Square , we lost an entire generation of lap performers , pole dancers and prostitutes . Mayor Anthony Weiner would bring those professions back into the city ' s economy . "The centerpiece of the would be mayor ' s concept is the development of a 269 acre combination adult amusement park and pornography production facility called Weiner World ." This would be the first ever clothing optional entertainment complex , " the campaign brochure stated . " The plan is to build it in Staten Island , turning a landfill into a goldmine . "Other major recommendations of the blueprint would revoke Mayor Bloomberg ' s nanny reforms ." Smoke all you want , wherever you want , " the Weiner pamphlet advises . " What do we care ? Die young and help solve our Medicare problem . "Similarly , the plan encourages the use of oversize beverage containers . " In fact , the larger the soda , the less the tax . We want people to enjoy the full bouquet of their high fructose corn syrup . "Surprisingly , prohibitions on narcotics and other controlled substances remain Intact under the Weiner plan . " That will keep organized crime profitable , " the campaign literature said . " We ' re also going to revive Take a Thug to Lunch Day to keep the lines of communications open . "Weiner had originally released a 64 point plan on ways to restore the city as a place for middle class families . It was largely ignored , with critics who did read the offering describing its recommendations as " political clich s . "In contrast , Anthony Weiner ' s Fun City proposal has gotten rave reviews and may soon be converted into a major motion picture ." We looked long and hard for an idea that will make this city stand up and notice . We believe the concept is now at hand . " 	 1

Black Friday Weekend : 136 Million Expected to Flock to US SalesNearly 136 million shoppers are expected to flock to US sales over the Black Friday weekend , both in stores and online , according to the National Retail Federation .On Black Friday , the day after the Thanksgiving Day holiday , retailers trumpet special deals that kick off the year end holiday shopping season . Deals often start early , on Thanksgiving , as retailers scramble to take advantage of the shopping frenzy .The origins of the name are unclear , with some saying it refers to the intense jams of shoppers . But the more common explanation is that it points to profits being " in the black " as retailers bank on year end sales for a large part of their annual profits .The NRF estimates that 135 . 8 million people will be shopping over the four day holiday weekend , a modest 1 . 6 percent increase from last year .With the boom of online shopping , bricks and mortar stores are also beefing up their offers on websites and mobile devices .Digital research firm comScore predicts online sales in the November December period will increase 14 percent this year to 70 billion ( roughly Rs . 4 , 68 , 475 crores ) . Another firm , Forrester Research , estimates an 11 percent rise to 95 billion ( roughly Rs . 6 , 35 , 787 crores ) .Black Friday is followed by Cyber Monday , when back to work consumers continue their shopping online . According to the NRF , 184 million people intend to shop online that day .Retail spending is part of the consumer spending that drives about 70 percent of US economic activity , and so is seen as an indicator of the strength of consumer demand . But the importance of Black Friday has faded somewhat in recent years as shopping trends change and online sales gain ." Over the past several years , retailers have begun their holiday price promotions progressively sooner , not waiting for the traditional Black Friday day to begin offering price discounts , " said Chris Christopher , director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight .Many retailers open their doors on Thanksgiving Day , also known as Gray Thursday , cannibalizing Black Friday sales , he noted .This year , the Black Friday sales come in the context of weak retail revenues blamed in part on relatively warm weather that has discouraged cold weather purchases .On Wall Street , most major retailers were trading lower in the morning , including Wal Mart , Amazon , Macy ' s and The Gap . In contrast , Target climbed 0 . 2 percent after it reported a strong start to its Black Friday weekend , especially a 35 percent jump in online orders for in store pickup on Thanksgiving .Download the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news , product reviews , and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles . 	 0
los angeles thousands of members of the slicked back hair community gathered in hollywood monday to protest the film industry's longtime trend of depicting men with slicked back hair as untrustworthy, unlikeable antagonists. " there have been 4, 192 films in the past 10 years in which male characters with sleek or slicked back hairstyles have been portrayed in a negative light, " said ray swartz, chairman of the national organization of men with slicked back hair. " even though men with this hairstyle comprise just 3 percent of the u. s. populace, they make up nearly 80 percent of all film and tv villains, bad guys, and just plain assholes. as a result, thousands of men who enjoy wetting their hair and then combing it straight back face a silent but pervasive form of discrimination every single day. " " i'm just a man with slicked back hair, " swartz added. " does that make me a sleazeball? " according to statistics released by the organization, five out of every six characters with slicked back hair are cast as the primary antagonist. of this group, 29 percent are depicted as greedy and manipulative wall street sharks, 22 percent as cold, emotionless murderers, 19 percent as evil coaches or mentors, 12 percent as corrupt mafiosi, 8 percent as undead creatures who feast on human blood, and the remaining 10 percent fall into the general category of jerks pricks john travolta. more alarming, swartz said, is that certain subsets of slicked back hair americans endure even worse prejudices. he cited men with slicked back hair who also talk with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths, wear blue button down shirts with white collars, or place toothpicks behind their right ears as the most victimized. " just because i have heavily gelled, jet black, slicked back hair does not mean i can't lead a normal, productive life, " kettering, oh native martin sutulovich said. " i'm not consumed by an insatiable thirst for power, i know nothing about the high pressure world of real estate speculation, and i have a wife and kids whom i love very much. the last thing i want to do is murder them, cut them up into tiny pieces, bag them up, and put them out with the trash, but when strangers look at me, that's all they think. " a recent study conducted by swartz's group indicates that americans who slick back their hair usually experience typical development, have life spans equal to those without slicked back hair, and are no more likely to stoically torture people with medical instruments than the average dry haired citizen. " you always see crooked lawyers and politicians with slicked back hair in the movies, but when was the last time you saw a computer programmer with slicked back hair, a farmer who built a magical baseball field in a cornfield with slicked back hair, or a man who defused a bomb at the last possible second to save thousands of innocent lives with slicked back hair? " swartz said. " never. " " the closest thing we've ever gotten to a hero is steven seagal or that spanish neighbor guy on sanford and son, " he added. " and seagal's hair is pulled back into a ponytail, so he doesn't even really count. " swartz also pointed out that even females who appear in films with slicked back hair often end up transforming into aliens who have sex with people and then kill them. " i have naturally oily hair. if i leave it dry, it ends up messy by the end of the day, so i slick it back, " doug roessner of brockton, ma said. " i sell insurance for a living, so how am i supposed to get my clients to trust me when they all think i'm some money hungry scumbag? and every time i tell my bosses that i'll'take care of'a problem, they immediately assume i mean murdering someone. it's pathetic. " " my son hasn't been the same around me since he watched d2 : the mighty ducks last month, " said slicked back hair man mick romanini, referencing the film in which coach gordon bombay slicks back his hair when consumed by fame, then wears it dry again upon realizing the error of his ways. " is this what we want to teach our children about slicked back hair? " added romanini, " he should be able to do whatever he wants with his hair when he gets older and not worry that people are going to assume he's the kind of guy who would plot his best friend's death and then seduce the widow to get his hands on the insurance money. " in interviews, studio executives have countered the protests 	 1
There ' s a new reality TV show , called " My Husband ' s Not Gay , " about four men in Utah who say they are attracted to men and yet have chosen to marry women . The show has stirred up controversy , in some cases for all the wrong reasons ." I think it ' s irresponsible to be airing a show with the content that gives the idea that sexual orientation is a choice , " GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said . " That a discredited and old idea . " ABC ' s Robin Roberts agreed : " To even give the idea that it is a choice can be very dangerous , especially to young people who are dealing with their sexuality and trying to figure things out . "Much of the gay community ' s critique of the show centers around the fact that these four men , who are Mormon , are linked to deeply anti gay " reparative therapy " that teaches men to " pray away the gay . " This so called " therapy " is as psychologically damaging to individual gay people as it is to our societal aspirations to be ever more equitable and tolerant .The show reinforces gay self loathing by driving home the idea that being gay is inconsistent with being a person of faith . Nothing could be further from the truth . Maybe what needs changing isn ' t these men but the Mormon Church that would be a better angle for a reality show .At the dawn of the gay rights movement , people wanted to liberate sexuality not only for gay men and women but also for everyone , expanding the range of sexual self expression along a spectrum of identities .But some believed that gayness would be less threatening to the heterosexual status quo if it ' s wasn ' t a choice . The phrase " sexual preference " gave way to " sexual orientation , " suggesting something unchanging , the gay south to heterosexual north . Scientists hunted for the " gay gene " as proof that sexual orientation is fixed at birth .Lady Gaga ' s " Born This Way " seemed to seal the deal . Or did it ?Some people think being gay is a choice some disagree . The debate continues . But in a free society , everyone should be free to make a choice about sexuality . This may seem like a very disruptive notion to heterosexuality , but I ' ve always favored a version of gayness that is very disruptive to the status quo .In the face of restrictive traditions that argue one should choose to not be gay , how should one respond ? The best answer is that people should feel entirely free to choose whatever sexuality they want and that their choice should be celebrated and afforded full legal protections and cultural equality .Your sexual identity and self expression should be up to you . And that is the problem at the heart of " My Husband ' s Not Gay " and " reparative therapy " : not the idea that being gay might be a choice but that being straight is compulsory or forced , whether by religions of society in general . That compulsion is the problem . The antidote to that , simply , is choice .Mormons , for instance , choose to be Mormon . While most of us are born into a faith tradition , no one would seriously argue religious beliefs are written into our biology or DNA . But we honor and respect religious choices , and afford them protections under our laws because we are a nation that continually aspires to increasing freedom and self determination .It ' s perfectly wonderful to choose to be Mormon . It ' s perfectly wonderful to choose to be gay . And it should be perfectly wonderful to choose to be both . That would be a reality worth tuning in for . 	 0
Multi millionaire fraudster and Liberal Democrat " leader " has been arrested in the Dominican Republic after going on the run , police said .Clegg was sentenced to five years " coalition " after perpetrating his fraud at Westminster in 2010 .He completely fooled around seven million people to back the Lib Dems in the general election based on the idea that he was the " leader " of a " proper political party which will bring honesty to British politics . "A City of London Police spokesman said : " We are pleased to hear that Nick Clegg has been detained by authorities in the Dominican Republic , and are currently establishing contact with them to find out further details about his arrest ." Clearly , at some stage we will look for his return to the United Kingdom , so he can face the electorate for the fraud offences for which he has been convicted in this country . "An international manhunt was launched when Clegg went on the run after stealing nearly 10 billion from struggling students in the form of a " tuition fees scam " .He also posed as a highly successful political leader and claimed connections with the Prime Minister , David Cameron , to steal money from millions of public service pensioners .He secretly used this ' money to fund the record deficit he helped create through his unwise " investments " , and also blew a large slice of his ill gotten gains on an " extravagant " lifestyle as Deputy Prime Minister .A Lib Dem spokesman said : " An Electoral Commission inquiry has found that the party accepted this man as leader in good faith , and were in no way at fault ." It cleared the party of all wrongdoing and accepted that at the time of the leadership election Clegg had claimed to be honest and progressive . "" We had no idea he would turn out be a fraudster and a crook . We are seriously considering replacing him with someone with impeccable honesty , someone like Chris Huhne . " 	 1

CHICAGO Producers of the long running Chicago Public Radio program This American Life announced Monday that they have completed their comprehensive 12 year survey of life as a modern upper middle class American .In what cultural anthropologists are calling a " colossal achievement " in the study of white collar professionals , the popular radio show has successfully isolated all 7 , 442 known characteristics of college graduates who earn between 62 , 500 and 125 , 000 per year and feel strongly that something should be done about global warming ." We ' ve done it , " said senior producer Julie Snyder , who was personally interviewed for a 2003 This American Life episode , " Going Eclectic , " in which she described what it ' s like to be a bilingual member of the ACLU trained in kite making by a Japanese stepfather . " There is not a single existential crisis or self congratulatory epiphany that has been or could be experienced by a left leaning agnostic that we have not exhaustively documented and grouped by theme . "Added Snyder , " We here at public radio couldn ' t be more pleased with ourselves . "The final episode , which explored the universal tribulations of having to live with roommates again in one ' s mid 30s after a divorce , provided an apt bookend for the project . The completed work is expected to be an indispensable source of information for years to come about the thoughts and tastes of bespectacled cynics prone to neuroses who are actually doing just fine .This American Life host and producer Ira Glass began work on the project in 1995 in Chicago , where he found himself inspired by and catering to an audience of professionals who dine out frequently and have a hard time getting angry . Glass and his team of producers , writers , and interns set about the exhausting task of gathering all available information on a range of subjects from minor skirmishes with the law to the rewards of occasionally talking to poor people . The raw data was then analyzed , deconstructed , reconstructed , re deconstructed , organized under a broad philosophical title , and interspliced with musical interludes by rock duo They Might Be Giants .Though This American Life is now lauded as the definitive source for material about getting an autistic teenager admitted to Harvard , its early run was marked by painful trial and error , according to producer Alex Blumberg ." At first , we were getting a lot of stories from recovered drug addicts and East African refugees living in the States , which had their compelling elements but came off a bit cloying , " Blumberg said . " But then we realized that if we had overeducated people with voices rather unsuitable for radio narrate the stories with clever analogies and accessible morals , the whole thing would come off far less depressing . "Blumberg said that the turning point came in 1997 , when producers discovered a group of inner city schoolchildren inadvertently teaching an important lesson to their attractive , suburban raised teacher about what makes us human .Also aiding the study were the many contributors to This American Life , who took time from their best selling essay writing careers to donate personal anecdotes about dropping out of prestigious art schools , taking harrowing but poignant childhood vacations to the Grand Canyon , and the unique challenges of growing up in families supportive of their homosexuality .On Sunday , writer and contributing editor Sarah Vowell called the project ' s end " oddly anticlimactic , " but questioned whether work was actually complete because the show had not yet addressed the subject of " Things Ending . "" Seeing this project through to its culmination was equally satisfying and strange , " said Vowell , speaking at a book signing in Colonial Williamsburg dressed as Betsy Ross . " I feel not unlike the early Pilgrims , who , standing atop Plymouth Rock after a long and arduous sea voyage , reflected on their journey , perhaps thinking to themselves ' For God ' s sake doesn ' t anybody have anything to eat in this settlement ? ' "Glass , who personally contributed over 2 , 000 anecdotes from his own life for documentation , called the project ' s conclusion the " end of an era . "" When we finished , I have to tell you , I felt something I never expected : a profound sense of contentment maybe even relief , " Glass said . " Afterwards , the other producers and I sat around for a long while , remarking on how interesting and strange it was to finally complete the study , and how perhaps it is , in some way , symbolic of life in general .

There ' s still doing it , " he adds . " There ' s nothing I can do . "' Like a bad dream '" Me jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys , it would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as myself , " he said . " There ' s just no telling what might have happened . "" I took it really personal . I had many sleepless nights . I had nightmares , " he said .Moody retired two weeks after the attack , after 18 years driving buses . The fight was " the final straw and it was a big straw , too , " he said .Police say the youths attacked the 13 year old after he told officials at their dropout prevention school that one of them had tried to sell him drugs . The ferocity of the attack left the victim with two black eyes and a broken arm .Could your child be a bully ?Criticism , but no basis for chargesGulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent told WFLA that Moody should have stepped in ." There was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the welfare of the children or the child in this case , and he didn ' t make any effort to do so , " Vincent said .But prosecutors say they have no grounds on which to bring charges .In 2012 : New York teen says bullies beat and blinded himAccording to Pinellas County school policy , the bus driver isn ' t required to intervene , only to call dispatch . He can step in , if he feels it ' s safe .Police said Moody could have given first aid to the victim after the attackers jumped off the bus , but Bartlett said the 13 year old didn ' t hang around ." The kid gets up and skedaddles out the door , " he said .Outrageous moments caught on cameraOther counties actually forbid drivers from physically stopping fights .And Moody ' s lawyer , Frank McDermott , said the complaints about Moody are unfair . Other students " would have been put in huge danger had he tried to physically intervene , " McDermott said .And he said " a lot of attention " should be focused on school administrators , whom he suggested could have done more to prevent the beating ." School officials let these two boys back on the bus , or let them on the bus , and Mr Moody had no idea what had happened at the school , " McDermott said . 	 0
Early on Tuesday morning , two Palestinian men from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber entered a synagogue in the sleepy West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof and went on a killing spree . Armed with guns and knives , the two men killed four rabbis three Israeli American and one Israeli British before they were struck down by Israeli police . The attack , which also claimed the life of a police officer , was the deadliest in a series of recent " lone wolf " attacks against Israelis across Jerusalem .The Israeli response was swift . The Israeli military ordered the demolition of the perpetrators ' homes . Israeli border police blocked access to several East Jerusalem neighborhoods that have been recent flash points for conflict . And Israeli security services conducted raids in several towns in the West Bank .Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attacks and hammered Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas for inciting the ongoing violence in Jerusalem . Similarly , U . S . Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the " senseless brutality , " and called on Abbas to do the same .Abbas soon stepped up . It was his first condemnation of any attack in Jerusalem since the unrest began last month . Indeed , the aging Palestinian leader is walking a tightrope . On the one hand , lone wolves are by definition not under the control of Abbas nor other Palestinian political organizations . And it is also true that Abbas has not been the driving force of the Jerusalem unrest . But at the same time , he does appear to be making an effort to benefit from the tensions , seemingly seeking to ride this current wave of nationalist fervor .Yet Abbas is also operating from a political place of strength . The West trusts him because he brought an end to the violence of the second intifada , or uprising ( 2000 2005 ) . The Israelis need him because his forces in the West Bank cooperate with the Israelis on a range of security issues . In many ways , Abbas is responsible for preventing a third intifada in the West Bank the territory he controls .However , both Israel and the United States have badly mismanaged the relationship with the Palestinian Authority , doubling down on a system that has failed to invest in Palestinian good governance , let alone new leadership . As a result , neither have much leverage to tone down his rhetoric , short of threatening to oust him from power .Ultimately , though , there is also the question of whether the Palestinian leader actually has the ability to bring stability back to Jerusalem . Even though Palestinians claim the city as their capital , Jerusalem is outside of Abbas ' jurisdiction . Moreover , Abbas is now nine years into a four year term , and his popularity is flagging .The 79 year old Abbas may be thinking about his legacy after nearly a decade of failed peace talks and internecine squabbles that have divided the Palestinian people , both politically and geographically . The key question is whether Abbas believes he can resuscitate his political fortunes on the Palestinian street by supporting the Jerusalem unrest . If he does , the path to de escalation is clouded .If Abbas is not the answer , the trick for U . S . and Israeli policymakers is identifying who else to engage . And it is far from clear who that person might be . 	 0
Springfield PA A vampire cat has been discovered living in a Philadelphia suburb . The species is new to science and is given the Latin name of Felix vampirus . The vampire cat ' s name is Ginger and she is owned by a Mr Fish ." Ginger was very strange from the time she was born . " said Mr Fish . " Her teeth were incredibly sharp when I first got her last year , especially her fangs . She couldn ' t stand the sun and hid under the bed until nightfall . "Mr Fish said Ginger ' s eating habits were bizarre and he began to suspect vampirism six months ago ." Ginger has never eaten anything as far as I know . When she was a kitten she would bite me and lick up the blood . I never minded since it was just a few drops . Now , she drinks about a pint of my blood a day . I don ' t mind . I am her slave . " said the pale Mr Fish .The cat ' s vampirism isn ' t transmitted to humans yet . But that ' s only because none of Ginger ' s human victims have died . Scientists are concerned the vampirism could spread .Mr Fish says Ginger is very popular with everyone in Springfield and has dozens of human slaves that wait for her each sunset ." I know Ginger bites all my neighbors , I ' ve seen the bite marks on their wrists and necks . I can ' t wait to die and become a vampire too . Then Ginger and I can go hunting every night for blood ! " said the very strange Mr Fish . 	 1
Louis Saha has urged Manchester United to address their defensive problems in the January transfer window or risk missing out on the Champions League again .United dropped to 10th place in the Barclays Premier League after Sunday ' s 1 0 derby defeat to Manchester City and Saha fears his former club could now finish outside the top four for the second successive season .David Moyes was sacked last April just 10 months after succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson as United went from champions to seventh their lowest league position for 25 years and replaced by the experienced Dutchman Louis van Gaal .Louis Saha celebrates scoring the winner against Sunderland at Old Trafford in September 2007Anderson and Saha ( centre ) congratulate Cristiano Ronaldo ( right ) after his goal against Blackburn in 2007' I hope they finish in top four but I can ' t be sure , ' said Saha , who scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for United between 2004 and 2008 .' A club of this size should be looking for the fourth spot to be in the Champions League but it is not the case right now .' You could say the issues are at the back but it ' s about balance , finding the right midfielder to keep the ball and a defender to be strong at a certain point of the game .Former Fulham , United and Everton striker Saha was speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar' It ' s difficult to predict what will happen but when you have a very balanced side you have balanced results .' I ' m not more experienced than Louis van Gaal to know what was a ( defensive ) regret for him but we will see at the end of the season , and what he does in this window this winter will be very important for Manchester United . 'Saha , speaking at the DohaGOALS Conference in Qatar , believes Van Gaal will get the time to turn around United that was not afforded to Moyes , who took the Frenchman from United to Everton in 2008 .But Saha said Van Gaal must listen to the concerns of the fans and add defensive strength in January to go with the impressive attacking armoury he now has at his disposal following a summer of heavy investment which saw Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao added to the likes of Wayne Rooney , Robin van Persie and Juan Mata .' You always have to listen to what people say and maybe the defence is a bit weak or not experienced enough , ' Saha said .Everton manager David Moyes speaks to Saha after his side ' s 2 1 FA Cup win over Middlesbrough in 2009' He ( Van Gaal ) has to look at it and address that point for sure , but he is an experienced manager so I ' ve no doubt he will do so .' I have seen a slight change and you can see there is a bit more confidence and a bit more shape , but the result is not what you would expect from a side like this .' Time will definitely be on his side more than David Moyes because of the experience he has and the trophies in all his clubs .' You expect the Premier League to be a difficult challenge for any team and Manchester United has been struggling in the last two years , but in football you have to make the transition as soon as possible . 'But Saha rejected criticism that United ' s failure to improve under Van Gaal was down to the Dutchman being surprised by the intensity of the Premier League .' He ' s experienced , he has plenty of gigabytes of information and people there with him who know about football , ' Saha said .' It would be unthinkable for Manchester United not to be in the Champions League again but the Premier League is a different league to what it was 10 years ago .' There are many teams that have got huge players and the quality is greater that ' s why I stopped , I think !' The level and intensity what you can show every week is amazing , there are no easy games . ' 	 0
" By the time I knew about it , it was too late . " Those are the words of Roger Ford , resident of Tuscaloosa , South Carolina , who recently participated in a study supported by the National Institute of Health about the most common causes of death in the United States . Startling findings revealed that 95 of participants are in fact already dead , and some never lived .Thomas Callahan , Ford ' s neighbor for 12 years , was also a participant in the study , and is also dead . " It ' s the strangest thing because I ' d see Roger everyday , " remarked Callahan while seated in a rocking chair on his front porch . " We always go out and get the paper at the same time , then just go about our business . " He added with a laugh , " And I just became a grandfather again this month , " but then more quietly , " I guess life and death do go hand in hand . "Though the causes of death are still undetermined , symptoms seem comparable to a form what scientists are now calling " adult still borns . " Dr Fir Crane , associate professor of gynocology at the University of South Carolina , Greenwood , elaborated on those findings ." When we examined the brain scans and performed the blood work , the tests revealed our adults have the same activity and biochemical make up as newborn still borns . We ' re still finalizing the tests , but it ' s possible to reverse the findings to indicate just when most of these people died . "Crane noted that preliminary efforts reveal most people died during adolescence . " At least , that ' s when I died . "So who are those members of the population who are still alive ? An official from the NIH , who requested not to be named since the official announcement has yet to be made , disclosed that they in fact do not know . " We ' re still focusing on why so many of us have died already , " our source shared . " At the moment , the majority of our resources have been focused on the prevention of death . When we ' ve achieved that , then we ' ll begin researching sources of life . "News of these findings has caused a stir between pro life and pro choice supporters alike . " How can I advocate life if I can ' t recognize once someone has died ? " says Harriet Goodman , local resident and outspoken pro life supporter outside a Planned Parenthood building off of Roe Way in downtown Greenwood . " I sometimes ask myself , ' Why bother ? ' But I ' m here . . . aren ' t I ? "At the same time , expectant parents are becoming reluctant with each added detail disclosed from the study . " With this epidemic going on , it ' s like there ' s no difference between birth and aborting , " shared Wanda Sanderson in the Planned Parenthood parking lot . " How do we know our child is truly healthy ? My gynocologist said I never lived . "Still , that hasn ' t stopped Hollywood from taking notice . Joel Silver is presently in the process of developing a film starring Shia LaBeouf and helmed by director Zack Snyder of a movie some are calling " Y : The Last Man " meets " Land of the Dead . " It ' s the story of a man who wakes up one morning and finds he ' s the only one in the world who has died , but nobody knows it .Filming is set to start in August of 2010 . Rumored film locations already scouted out are Quebec , the Indian Sea , The Vatican , all of Peru , John Malkovich , Tehran , the Philippines , Papua New Guinea , Angkor Wat , and Kalamazoo . 	 1
Premier League football clubs are set to introduce " controlled pitch invasions " to improve the atmosphere at the end of next season .After the proposals for safe standing areas were unanimously turned down last week at the F . A ' s Soho headquarters , some clubs have put forward ideas to allow pitch invasions when their side survives relegation , wins the Championship or qualifies for Europe .The move follows the constant criticisms that the excitement in the crowds has fallen steadily since the Premier League was formed in 1992 .Garth Fishman , the commercial director at Bolton Wanderers , said : " A group of ten Premier League clubs including ourselves , Chelsea and Charlton want to take steps to prove that those who run the game are not kill joys ." We have been working on these ideas for some time now and we have secured the services of event managing group Get Set to make sure invasions can be safely orchestrated . "Stewart Perrit , the managing director of Get Set , said a number of practice sessions involving thousands of volunteers at the Reebok have been successful ." Essentially we will have 50 invasion stewards per stand , who will control different sections of the fans and will allow them on to the pitch at staggered time intervals . There will be no crushes or accidents . End of seasons will never be the same again . "Some clubs who are perpetually involved in mid table battles have argued that they should be allowed pitch invasions if they manage to improve a position on the last day of the season .David Goldstone , the owner of Tottenham Hotspur , said : " The way the prize money situation stands , if we finish tenth instead of eleventh we will get an extra half a million pounds . The fans will want to celebrate that a lot , as it pays one weeks wages of our substitute goalkeeper Hans Ogilvy . "Some other clubs are not so keen on the idea . The manager of West Brom , Geoff Byrd , was very critical of the plans when he heard about them last night at their player of the year awards ." Do people not read about what happens in those African countries where pitch invasions cause the death of hundreds of people . Invasions are human stampedes whether they are controlled or not .

tom daley wanted the world to hear the truth straight from his mouth. the 19 year old diver, who was one of britain's heart throb poster boys for the london 2012 olympics, took to youtube monday to reveal he is in a relationship with a man. after complaining that he had been misquoted in an interview over his sexuality, daley recorded a five minute clip before tweeting : " got something i need to say... not been an easy decision to make, hope you can support me! : ). " in the short video, he said : " in spring this year my life changed massively when i met someone, and they make me feel so happy, so safe and everything just feels great. " that someone is a guy. " earlier this year, in september, the london 2012 bronze medalist was voted the world's sexiest man by leading gay magazine, attitude. while daley has always been cautious in commenting on his private life, he felt the time was right to make the revelation after being angered by quotes attributed to him in a recent interview. he said : " one thing i consider to be pretty important is having a private life and you're probably thinking,'why did you do a book, why did you do a documentary?'" in an ideal world i wouldn't be doing this video because it wouldn't matter, but recently i was misquoted in an interview and it made me feel really angry. " for me honesty is important and i've always been honest. i may have been vague in some of my answers, but i've always been honest. " one thing i've never really felt that comfortable with talking about is relationships. i've never really had a serious relationship to talk about. " daley said he has been dating the man for several months. " it did take me by surprise a little bit, " he said. " i did have in the back of my mind that something like that could happen. " it wasn't until spring this year that something just clicked and felt right. my whole world just changed there and then. " of course i still fancy girls. right now i'm dating a guy and couldn't be happier. i feel safe and it really does just feel right. people are going to have their own opinions and i think people are going to make a big deal about this. " is it a big deal? i don't think so. i wanted to say something and i feel like now i am ready to do it. " daley shot to prominence in 2008 after reaching the finals of both the individual 10 meter platform and 10 meter platform synchro events at the beijing olympics at the age of 14. he has since go on to establish himself as a celebrity both in and out of the diving arena, gaining over 2. 4 million twitter followers and even having his own television show in the uk, called " splash. " his life in the public eye has not come without its problems. daley suffered bullying at school and was subjected to vile online abuse last year after placing fourth in the synchro event at london 2012, before bouncing back to stand on the podium in the individual competition. he also lost his father rob in 2011 following a five year battle with cancer. but daley says his announcement would not have been a problem for his father, although he does concede there have been " mixed opinions " within his family. " people think : what would your dad say? he always said to me,'as long as you are happy, i'm happy.'and right now i couldn't be happier. " my mum ( debbie ) has been so supportive as well. all the friends and family i have told have been so supportive, which has been great. " i told the rest of my family today, and let's just say they had mixed opinions. lots of them did not believe it. lots of them wanted me to keep it quiet. " i didn't want to get my words twisted. i wanted to put an end to all the rumors and speculation, and just say it and tell you guys. it's what i want to do. " my friends and family are always there to support me. and i hope you guys can be too. i mean i'm still tom, i still want to win an olympic gold medal in rio 2016 for great britain. i am still as motivated as ever to do that. it would be great to have you guys on that journey, too. " daley will now head to houston, texas, for the team gb training camp until christmas. he follows other leading divers in making a public statement about their sexuality. australia's matthew mitcham announced he was homosexual before he won gold in beijing, while four time olympic champion greg louganis came out as gay after quitting the sport in 1995 	 0

He wouldn ' t let his holder or long snapper accept any part of the blame . He didn ' t point out that he had made three other field goals of 22 , 43 and 47 yards to account for all of his team ' s points during the game , which just happened to be the third coldest in league history .Instead , Walsh looked right at the reporters and into their cameras and took responsibility for what had just happened ."

WASHINGTON , DC Plagued by late fees , high interest rates , and harassing creditors , the U . S . took out a debt consolidation loan Monday , combining the nation ' s 6 . 1 trillion debt into a single , easy monthly payment ." My fellow Americans , we have just taken the first step toward regaining control of our finances , " said President Bush at a press conference . " Thanks to a joint arrangement between the Treasury Department , the Federal Reserve , and E Z Debt Services of Baltimore , we are finally on our way to freedom from debt . "As of press time , the national debt stands at 6 , 144 , 393 , 982 , 061 . 52 .Under the terms of the consolidation , E Z Debt Services will repay the nation ' s estimated 45 , 000 creditors , a majority of whom are foreign investors , insurance companies , banks , and other privately held entities . In return , the U . S will make a single monthly payment of 9 . 26 billion , adjusted for inflation , to E Z Debt every month for the next 70 years ." We are proud to enter into this arrangement with the federal government , " E Z Debt spokesman Phil Rizzo told reporters . " We know how hard it is when you ' re buried under a mountain of bills with seemingly no way to get out . When you don ' t know where else to turn , E Z Debt is there to help get you back on your feet . "The government first became aware of E Z Debt Services on July 10 , when Sen . Max Baucus ( D MT ) happened to see a commercial for the company while watching late night television . Two days later , President Bush saw the same ad during a 3 a . m . M A S H rerun .According to White House press secretary Ari Fleischer , Bush was sitting at his desk clutching a fistful of past due notices when he saw the ad ." He was holding all these unpaid bills , and tons more were piled high on his desk , including a three month old bill from Lockheed Martin for 5 . 3 billion worth of jet fighters , " said Fleischer , who was in the Oval Office working late at the time . " He raised the handfuls of bills above his head and shouted , ' I can ' t take it anymore ! ' That ' s when the ad came on . "After extensive meetings between E Z Debt officials and the Treasury Department , an arrangement was reached which provided a manageable payment plan with no threatening phone calls or military invasions from creditor nations .Though the House Of Representatives swiftly and decisively approved the consolidation plan by a vote of 285 to 103 , the Senate took longer to rally the necessary support , debating the issue for weeks ." I was definitely skeptical about E Z Debt , as were many of my colleagues , " Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D SD ) said . " I ' d heard horror stories about those debt services . England used one to get out of a recession in the late ' 80s , and they ' re still paying for it . "" But E Z Debt is different , " Daschle continued . " Jim Smoller , our E Z Debt representative , sat down with me and the other senators and really convinced us that debt consolidation was the way to go . He was extremely helpful , taking the time to patiently answer all our questions . He even gave us a free quote . "Opponents of the plan charge that it unnecessarily endangers the numerous national assets offered as collateral . Among the valuable properties being put up are Yellowstone National Park , NASA , and the state of Alaska ." Holding the nation hostage to a single creditor is hardly preferable to the original situation , " said Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D CA ) during a lengthy Senate debate on the consolidation . " Besides , I am confident that if we just trim a few unnecessary expenses from the budget and somehow get a little bigger GNP , we can climb out of this hole without help . We just need a little more time . "" Okay , so we mismanaged our money a little bit who doesn ' t every now and then ? " Sen . Bill Frist ( R TN ) said . " But that ' s no reason to resort to using one of those get out of debt now services . "Despite such opposition , ultimately , the Senate ' s pro consolidation voices won out ." In the end , everybody came to see that E Z Debt isn ' t just another loan . It ' s a way to get out of debt without declaring bankruptcy , " Daschle said . " Thanks , E Z Debt . We couldn ' t have done it without you . " 	 1
the legends behind the mysterious voodoo queen marie laveau have captivated people in the deep south for centuries. born a free black woman, her practice of voodoo in the city of new orleans earned her a plethora of cult like followers as well as merchandise lines, local urban legends, and even country ballads dedicated to her mystical life. now, it seems as though the voodoo queen has returned to this world only not in her home city of new orleans. instead, she seems to have made her home in a small, rural town in south carolina. rumors have continued to circulate from residents of mountain rest of a woman who lives there and performs " miracles for those in need. " born under the name of stacy richmond, stacy says she had a strange feeling she was much more than just a backwoods southern girl from south carolina. she says that her memories began to return to her around the age of seven. " i would go out into the woods to play and the forest would seem like home. i loved to look for snakes especially, they seemed almost like family to me, " recalls stacy, who now goes by the name " marie ". marie's family raised her in a southern baptist church, much like the majority of the families in mountain rest. she recalls attending services regularly but never quite feeling like she belonged. " everyone was so nice, but it just never really felt right to me. like something was telling me'you know this is not what you believe'". shortly after she turned sixteen, marie began answering her call to her original life in secret. " i couldn't take it anymore. the feelings were just too strong, i had to find out what was pulling me so hard. " marie bagan on the internet, searching voodoo cultures and views on reincarnation. this lead her to even deeper research at local libraries as well as online forums. no matter where she turned though, the life of marie laveau is what always spoke to her the strongest. " i would look at records and say'no, thats not what really happened '.... how would i know that if i were not actually marie laveau? it just felt so right, like the feeling you get when you know your home. " after the tragic death of her parents in a car accident, marie stayed at the house she had been raised in. only now, she no longer had to keep her voodoo practices a secret. eventually, she was reunited with her " familiar " in the form of an eastern diamondback rattlesnake. " i was out in the woods searching for herbs when i saw him sunning himself on a rock by a small spring. normally, diamondbacks are very leery of humans and are quick to let one know they are somewhere they don't belong, but this time was different. he didn't rattle, puff himself up, or anything like that. i felt the same calm, friendly feeling i felt around other snakes only this was much deeper, as if we were connected. " marie slowly approached the snake which made no attempt to rattle or strike. instead, she stretched out her hand and the snake rested his head in her hand then moved up her arm and came to rest across her shoulders. " i felt like i had found my best friend again. zombi has not left my side since that day. his venom has even come to use in many of my rituals. " it is her rituals that eventually lead to her discovery. locals have sought her out for everything from help in finding a new job to infertility, even help with cancer originally thought to be inoperable. while voodoo is not highly thought of in a highly christian town, people still seem to come to marie for help when they feel nothing else has worked. " i had been unemployed for a long time, my family was in danger of losing our home. " one local man, who wishes to remain anonymous due to fact he went to a voodoo woman for help, tells his encounter with the reincarnated voodoo queen. " i had heard people talking about a woman with a snake that could make things happen for people who came to her. i figured, what harm could it do? i was desperate. " marie recalls when this man came to see her fondly. " he showed up at my home and looked so lost. i don't really know if he knew what it was he was doing or what he expected to see or find. probably some crazy old hag with eyeballs in jars i suspect. laughs i invited him in for some sweet tea and we had a very nice talk. i was so happy when he let me help him with his troubles.

As part of the public service I provide to my faithful readers , occasionally I allow them access to some of the mail I receive from those whose toes I have put to the fire :Dear Dr Billingsgate ,Ever since I started campaigning for the presidency my husband has not been himself . He complains about everything stomach problems , not being able to focus his eyes , and most troublesome of all , during his occasional romps in the hay with various bimbos I hear him cry out , " Baby , they hardly even knew ye . " What do you suggest ?Sincerely ,Hillary Rodham ClintonDear Hill ,Since this is the very first letter that I will address in this format , let me congratulate you for taking advantage of my services . Fortunately , the complexity of your problem allows me to use most , if not all , of my 13 doctorates .First : Regarding your husband ' s stomach problems . It sounds like he suffers from acute pre election gastroesophagel reflux disease . In layman ' s terms , he can ' t stomach you being defeated .Second : Regarding his inability to focus . If you are describing his reaction to when he looks at you , it is quite understandable that he has a problem focusing . Even with your charisma , you are , ahem , less than an eyefull .Third : In respect to your hubby ' s haunting proclamation during sex , I doubt if he is talking to anyone in particular . Believe me , it ' s not unusual for a male to talk to his penis while engaging in sex .NOTE : Since it is very satisfying to be able to combine my potpourri of thirteen doctorate degrees into one workable solution for you , please note that special emphasis was given to my degree in Taxidermy . If you ever need my services , you know how to reach me . 	 1
The Rolling Stones have been the ' world ' s greatest rock ' n ' roll band ' for decades . Now two of the original members , Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman , revealed sensational new facts about the band ' s history in interviews .When former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman ' s book ' Stone Alone ' was published back in 1997 it instantly became a bestseller .Besides his accurate descriptions on the life of the Rolling Stones in the studios and on the road , he told the readers about his almost incredible sex life and told details about encounters with hundreds of girls and women .But in a recent interview the 73 year old rock star admitted that all that is nothing but pure fiction ." I never had intimate relationships with anybody except for my steady partner at a given time . Well , er , and honestly , I never was too active in that field " he told a journalist in a luxury hotel in Sheffield .Wyman said that he was forced on request of the book ' s editors to blow up his sex life in the book ." Well , I sent them my manuscript where I had told things how they had actually been " , he stated , " but they said : What ? A Rolling Stone without an exuberant sex life ? How should we sell this book at all ? So I asked my friends about their adventures in that field and took notes . Thank God I got a lot of friends who were much more active than I had ever been or dreamed of ." I listened to lots of stories and did not care too much if they were true or not . For instance , the 16 year old son of a neighbor told me about the toothpaste trick which I attributed to that lady in Asia . With my friends ' consent I added all their stories to my manuscript , and the editors were happy with it ." In the end the book sold hundreds of thousands of copies . "In the interview Bill Wyman talked about his secret passion : refurbishing rooms ." I am quite an experienced craftsman in all sorts of plumbing . So at a very early age I started refurbishing rooms . And by age 20 it had become my real passion " , he said ." When we had become famous and we were on tour I insisted that in each place we stayed the organizers had to reserve a hotel room for me which I could renovate completely . So while the others , except Charlie , were busy with lots and lots of women I painted walls , laid out new electricity , and renewed the carpets ." Very frequently Stu Ian Stewart had to pull me out of the room to get in time to the concert venue " .Even today guests can rent hotel rooms which were renovated by Bill Wyman ." If you look closely enough when watching our concert movies you can see stains of paints on my trousers " , he says .Wyman states that he not only invented the riff for the huge Stones hit ' Paint it , black ' but he also inspired Charlie Watts to write the lyrics ." I had played the riff accidentally over and over again on an organ in the studio . I remember it clearly because the studio room would urgently have needed refurbishing ." Some days later , Charlie came into the room I was renovating in a big hotel in Kansas City . I was busy painting an old red door in black color ." Suddenly , Charlie mumbled the words ' I see a red door and I want to paint it black ' ." He immediately disappeared , and within 15 minutes he came back with the complete lyrics ." When I had finished painting the door in the middle of the night we pulled the others out of their beds which was not easy because of the many girls that were around there and all that . We rushed to a studio and recorded a demo ." Mick and Keith were not impressed in the first place but when we did the proper recording at the RCA Studios in LA the song worked out perfectly with Brian on sitar . It became a one of our biggest hits . "According to Wyman the album entitled ' Black and Blue ' from 1976 also originated in his renovating passion , as well as other song titles and lyrics which Charlie Watts wrote , for example ' She ' s a rainbow ' ( ' She comes in colors everywhere . . . ' ) or ' Blue turns to grey ' .' I would still prefer the opportunity of overdoing any room that needs it over any pretty woman , except for my steady partner ' , says Wyman . 	 1
Lahaina , Maui In what is shaping up to be one of the most bizarre trials in recent history is set to begin tomorrow on the island of Maui , Hawaii . The man the media has dubbed The Avocado Terrorist will stand trial on felony charges . One Joseph De Falco is being accused of the destruction of millions of dollars of property in several different apartment complexes in the district of Lahaina , Maui .Apparently De Falco lived in one of the complexes for over five years . During that span it is estimated De Falco planted something like 1 , 250 1 , 500 avocado pits near sprinkle systems , under hibiscus bushes , and in many other shaded areas in his complex as well as a few other complexes near by . Avocados grow extremely well in Hawaii because of the volcanic soil and tropical climate provided they are given a lot of water .At first nothing happened , a few little trees shot up , a lot of people commented how nice it was to have avocado trees on the premise . But twenty years later there were so many avocado trees growing , they were starting to choke out the walkways . Avocados have shallow roots that stay near the surface and spread out , rupturing sidewalks and concrete . Eventually De Falco ' s plants started to break up the foundation of the several apartment complexes , cracking them in spots and breaking them completely in half in others .De Falco also known locally as Avocado Joe faces up to seven years in jail and up to one hundred thousand dollars in fines . In a press conference yesterday , De Falco commented on his current situation , " Mankind has really gotten lost , especially the media , " De Falco added . " People destroy a forest , and they call it development . But if a forest destroys a development they call it terrorism . Those avocado trees could feed that entire community , and then some . "De Falco initially pleaded not guilty , but after Maui county attorneys submitted evidence , which included three hand drawn maps , marking burial spots of Avocado plants as well as asterisks indicating sprinkler systems , it was recommended he change his plea .Also evidence was gathered on an internet site where he made references to his plan , joking about what he called his Avocado Army or the AA . Calling his army " the rage against the development . " His status on this popular personal internet site would often say things like : " MISSION ACCOMPLISHED , " after he had planted a bunch of pits or " INSPECTION OF THE AVOCADO ARMY COMPLETE EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN " ." It is obvious that these acts were done intentionally , " said Henry Kim prosecuting attorney . If convicted De Falco could face up to five years in prison for the crime of intentional planting Avocado trees on private property . 	 1
In his September 4 op ed , Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall . Published on the same day it was widely reported that the national debt had hit 16 trillion , his piece is as ill timed as it is unconvincing .Seeking to speak to and for his generation , he characterizes Obama as " our biggest ally in Washington . " He neglects , of course , to recount the harsh realities of the Obama economy . Instead , his message rests on the flimsy notion that we should hang on a little bit longer because enduring change takes time .You may be wondering what happened to " We can ' t wait " and " Yes we can . " Schlossberg concedes that we ' re " a little more cynical , " but contends that " just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes doesn ' t mean we should forget how far we ' ve come . "How far we ' ve come ?Unfortunately , such an argument demonstrates a sloppiness with the facts . Take , for instance , the fact that unemployment has remained above 8 since the beginning of Obama ' s term . Or , according to this analysis , that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama , the national debt has risen 5 trillion . Or that Obama presided over the first credit downgrade in American history .I could go on . The point is , these facts are overwhelming . And they are neither fair to young Americans nor signs of the progress for which we yearn . Rather , they are the residue of generational theft , of promises unmet , of false hopes and of crushed dreams . In a word , travesty . To argue otherwise is to fall out of a fairy tale .Schlossberg begins his piece with " The Catcher in the Rye ' s " Holden Caulfield . He compares Caulfield ' s desire to escape phonies to young people ' s support for Barack Obama in his first presidential campaign . But the problem with that analysis is that it ' s four years out of date . In 2008 , Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change , but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises .And there ' s more than meets to the eye to the president ' s self proclaimed achievements . While his allies may credit his health care law with allowing members of my generation to stay on our parents ' health care until we ' re in our mid 20s , the real question is , why can ' t we find jobs in the first place ? Obama regards students as beneficiaries of his achievements . Schlossberg praises the president ' s " insistence on keeping student interest rates low , " but that hasn ' t kept student loan debt from reaching record levels .Schlossberg ' s discussion of Obama ' s energy policy is equally selective . He talks about the president ' s " investments in clean energy projects and jobs , " but fails to mention that some of these " investments " came at a high price and on the dime of taxpayers . The saying goes that brevity is the soul of wit , so this argument merits a one word refutation : Solyndra .But of all of Schlossberg ' s claims , perhaps the most misguided is the notion that Obama has displayed political courage in the White House . He has refused to reform entitlements in a way that will ensure they remain solvent for future generations which is to say , us . Instead , he started a brand new trillion dollar entitlement program in the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , an unaffordable government takeover of our nation ' s health care system . His fiscal stewardship has been nothing short of a disaster . Four consecutive years of trillion dollar deficits isn ' t courageous it ' s immoral .Schlossberg does get one thing correct , however : Part of growing up is coming to terms with heartbreaking truths . But in this case , it ' s about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed . We don ' t have to fall into line once again only to be taken for granted . We can vote for a new direction . We can reward truth telling . We can elect Mitt Romney .The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Alex Schriver . 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC Amid growing concerns about the faltering stock market and deepening recession , President Bush vowed to tackle the nation ' s economic woes head on Tuesday , assuring the American people that he " will not rest " until Saddam Hussein is removed from power ." Our nation ' s economy is struggling right now , " said Bush , delivering the keynote address at the National Economic Forum . " Our manufacturing base is weak , new home sales are down , and unemployment is up . Millions of our people are suffering . That is why I stand before you tonight and make this promise : Saddam Hussein will be stopped . "With the Dow regularly suffering triple digit plunges and the Nasdaq hitting a six year low of 1184 . 94 late last month , Bush used the speech as an opportunity to outline his plan for getting the economy back on track ." We can no longer turn a blind eye to our tumbling stock market and the disintegration of the retirement package of the American worker , " Bush said . " That is why I have developed a 14 point plan for reviving America ' s economy . The first step is taking the biological and chemical weapons out of the hands of this madman . These sorts of weapons have no place in a peaceful world . "Turning to the problem of unemployment , Bush discussed his strategy for creating new jobs and stimulating growth in the tech sector ." We ' re working hard to put Americans back to work , " Bush said . " Our citizens are fighters , they just need the opportunity . And it is in this spirit that we are committed to defeating Saddam Hussein , so that the world may stand together in liberty and freedom . "Bush then addressed the issue of corporate malfeasance , promising sweeping reforms and a major crackdown on white collar criminals ." Corrupt CEOs must be treated like any other criminal , " Bush said . " The damage they do to this country , eroding investors ' faith in our stock market and corporate institutions , is extremely serious . I would like to deliver a clear message to those who would bilk hardworking Americans out of their hard earned 401K plans while greedily lining their own pockets : We cannot , and will not , sit idly by while this threat continues to mount in the Middle East . Iraq has stood in violation of U . N . resolutions since 1991 by refusing to allow weapons inspectors into the palace compound , where we suspect there are laboratories for creating weapons of mass destruction . We must remove the dictator Saddam Hussein and install a government that is committed to working toward free and democratic elections for the nation of Iraq . "Added Bush : " This man tried to kill my dad . "After the president ' s speech , Press Secretary Ari Fleischer issued a brief statement ." As you have just heard , the president and this administration are fully committed to turning the economy around , " Fleischer said . " We know how important it is for everyone to feel confident that their investment dollars are safe and that they will be able to build a better future for themselves and their children . We also know that what we really need to do at this time is to oust Saddam Hussein . Let ' s roll . " 	 1
fairview, mo the camping and concert grounds for countryfest 2002, a week long festival attended by more than 120, 000 music fans, was mistaken for a refugee camp by passing red cross workers tuesday. " i was driving back from fire cleanup efforts in colorado when the unmistakable stench of human offal hit me like a wall, " red cross volunteer jim montoya said. " as we came over the hill, there it was : rows of crowded tents pitched on the mud, giant piles of rotting garbage, and security personnel roving the barbed wire perimeter fence. i simply had to stop and intervene on behalf of the poor refugees in this overcrowded, impoverished settlement. " using his red cross id, montoya was able to obtain a full access countryfest vip wristband and move past the long lines of weary people in the paperwork processing lines at the camp's front gates, their possessions piled in bags at their feet. " this certainly is not the worst camp i've witnessed in my travels, " said montoya, 44, who has participated in relief missions in rwanda, sudan, and india. " but this being america, and given the fact that the camp has dubbed itself the'fun in the sun country music spectacular,'i would've expected them to have at least basic sanitation. not so. " despite the efforts of crews working around the clock, the festival's resources were severely stretched by day three. event organizers installed 100 portable toilets on the grounds, but the number proved woefully inadequate. the makeshift toilets were not emptied as scheduled and leaky, overflowing units spilled human waste into ditches. foot pump handwashing units were emptied mere minutes after they were refilled, as campers carried the water in buckets back to their living quarters, where no fresh water was available. " i pretty much know to avoid the bathrooms over on the stage end, " said festivalgoer stacey edwards as a mud splattered, shirtless 2 year old clung to her leg. " if you're a guy and just have to pee, you're probably okay, but if you're a girl, you better pray you don't come into contact with anything while squatting over the hole. " besides the lack of basic sanitation, montoya found other refugee camp staples at countryfest, including severe food shortages, wildly inflated prices for basic goods, and a lack of health care, with sick or injured parties directed to drive into town. " this is what happens when so many people are forced into such a small space, " montoya said. " whatever the reasons, these individuals traded in their stable ranch home existences for this. i simply could not turn a blind eye to this squalor, as the city government in fairview apparently has. " red cross rescue worker lauren elson said the camp has some semblance of an organizational structure, with certain decisions made by individuals at the shoney's sponsored countryfest info tent. a crude communications system also exists, with edicts periodically broadcast live on 94. 7 ktts, springfield's hot country mix. though a set of camp rules was posted near the fat jack's bbq ribs stand, lawlessness was still the norm. " impromptu settlements like this are always terribly disorganized because of how fast they grow, " elson said. " just last month, this place wasn't even here. but word of mouth spreads, and more bodies than expected show up. in this case, rumors about a surprise visit by someone called'reba'fueled the fire. " while a language barrier prevented elson from fully ascertaining the nature of the settlement, she determined that it was made up of displaced americans, largely of european ethnic descent. " i had a hard time understanding the refugees'almost indecipherable dialect, but i did glean some information, " elson said. " they call themselves'country folk.'i should note that despite the downtrodden nature of their settlement, they are still very proud of their shared identity. they've traveled, in some cases hundreds of miles, to convene with their people here and celebrate their culture. the big draw, as i understand it, is the promised appearance of 33 of their tribe's most prominent music makers, including travis tritt, kenny chesney, and martina mcbride. " elson said it is impossible for the average american to comprehend the " utterly rudderless existence of these uprooted people. " " cross state migrants and asylum seekers wander around listlessly in the heat of the full sun, trying desperately to attend to their most basic needs, " elson said. " people stand in line for hours for a small piece of roasted corn, while others desperately try to get any information they can about who is appearing on the papa john's bluegrass side stage that night 	 1
vatican city as pope john paul ii enters his 26th year as pontiff, the world is stopping to reflect on the legendary funnyman's career as one of the most influential performers in modern history. standing staunchly against contraception and women's equality right through the turn of the 21st century, the pope and his quirky, deadpan comic persona still entertain audiences around the world. revered by multiple generations for his weird and wonderful wit, the 83 year old pontiff is perhaps the best known stand up alive today. throughout an amazing two and a half decades as head of the catholic church, the pope has produced, in both his live appearances and his published works, a treasure trove of humor second to none. " i can still remember seeing him do his classic'galileo'bit in the early'90s, " said fellow comedian george carlin, referring to the pope's 1992 declaration that the church erred in condemning galileo. " here was this man, appearing on televisions around the world, making a proclamation that the sun does not move around the earth. i laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks. " " no one could touch the pope, " carlin added. " hell, no one even tried. he was in a class of his own. one of a kind. " born karol joseph wojtyla in wadowice, a town 35 miles southwest of krakow, the pope did not have an easy childhood. in what may have contributed to his desire to inspire laughter, he faced many early hardships. his mother died just a month before his 9th birthday, and only three years later, his brother died of scarlet fever. the pope began his religious career shortly thereafter, studying in an underground seminary in krakow. he established himself in the krakow scene and was awarded an archbishopric in 1963. he made cardinal in 1967. among the works to give the pope his first taste of fame was his 1960 treatise love and responsibility, in which he defined a " modern catholic sexual ethic. " it was here that the pope developed his oft repeated chestnut that the only acceptable act of sex is one intended for the creation of a child. " the pope would always lean on his material about sex, " director woody allen said. " he had this crazy, special way of looking at the world. i definitely count him among my influences. " after years of working the smaller cathedrals, the pope's hard work paid off. on oct. 16, 1978, he was chosen to head rome's most venerated comedic institution, the vatican. " no one else is still doing what the vatican does, " comedian don rickles said. " they may not be as big as they once were, but they still surprise like that bit a few weeks ago, where they said condoms don't prevent aids. was that improvised? " after 25 years at the top of his field, the pope still draws a crowd. on oct. 19, he presided over the beatification of mother teresa. more than a quarter of a million people flooded st. peter's square to witness the stunt, in which the pope declared that the hard working, benevolent nun had performed miracles and possessed supernatural powers. the pope has created more saints and beatified more people than all the previous popes combined, and no other pope has toured as extensively as he has. the quintessential showman loves to take his act on the road. he's entertained audiences in 117 countries and met with hundreds of world leaders, including dictators augusto pinochet and fidel castro. " john paul is the hardest working pope in history, " actor jonathan winters said. " he's an inspiration. and not just for other comedians like myself, but for everyone, from theologians who will never be ordained because they're women, on down to the little children in the crowded ghettos of third world cities who heed his message about the evils of contraception. let's not even go into the gays in boise. " since his first trip back to poland in 1978, the pope has performed in front of millions of loyal fans all over the world. " people would wait in line for hours to see him, " comedian joey bishop said. " and he never failed to deliver. he'd be out there working the crowd shaking hands, kissing babies. wherever he went, they loved him. " the pope has also been lauded for his ability to think on his feet. throughout his many years in the business, the pope has often been called upon to deliver a comeback when questioned about acts committed by the catholic church. " john paul ii has riffed on everything from the crusades and the spanish inquisition to the treatment of jews and blacks, " actor bob newhart said. " he's always had a unique ability to come at things in an unexpected way. i saw him last year on tv, talking about those mole 	 1
Koro , Uganda One of the abducted boys featured in the viral video demanding the capture of infamous warlord Joseph Kony is now a man and says the time for justice has arrived .Jacob Acaye , now 21 , revisited the village where he was abducted by Kony ' s Lord ' s Resistance Army to tell why Kony ' s crimes should not be forgotten .His story has touched millions since it was featured in " Kony 2012 , " a video from the Invisible Children charity that created a global online buzz and renewed public interest in capturing Kony .Critics have questioned the film ' s accuracy and warned that it oversimplified the situation in Uganda .Kony first unleashed his fury in eastern Africa more than two decades ago and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court .The LRA terrorized Uganda in a brutal campaign against the government and civilian population . Since 2006 , when it was pushed out of northern Uganda , it has largely operated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic .Invisible Children aimed to make Kony a household name and drum up global support to end the murders , rapes , abductions and other abuses committed by the LRA ." It has been going on for the last 26 years . It shows that we are failing to solve it . And if there are any means that someone can help and it goes to end , then why not Americans get involved ." For me the criticism of " Kony 2012 " is unfair , because if I am to say it is fair then I wouldn ' t be here . Right now I wouldn ' t have been able to go to school . You wouldn ' t have been able to speak to me right now because I had no hope in my life . I reached even a point when I said , ' I can even die now ' because I thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering , you know . "Acaye ' s home was Koro , a small dusty village a handful of circular huts off the main north south road . There is little more than a track through the village and the occasional cockerel wanders from hut to hut .As Acaye squatted down on the edge of Koro he said he has watched an earlier version of the Kony film , but added " It brings back a lot of memories . Sometimes I get sad when I watch it . "LRA rebels raided Koro in the middle of the night , smashing down the door in the hut where he was sleeping . He says they took 40 children that night .Acaye said his brother tried to escape the LRA but was captured and executed . It was the sight of his brother being killed that made Acaye realize he had no choice but to try to escape .He managed to reach the town of Gulu , about 11 kilometers ( 7 miles ) from his village , and a shelter where he found safety .Now , after more than five years of peace in Northern Uganda many wonder if the online movie highlighting Kony ' s crimes is too late .Acaye is now chasing the childhood ambition he thought was lost forever studying law in Uganda ' s capital , Kampala .He says the LRA has left his village but justice must be done . 	 0
WOODWARD , OK U . S . teens are " getting wasted " down at the local quarry 37 percent less than in years past , according to the small town sheriffs who closely monitor their activities ." In the past three months , we ' ve only received two citizen complaints about rowdy kids down at the old Carter quarry , and we ' ve all but suspended patrol duty out there , " said Woodward County Sheriff Clyde " Dutch " Meinhold at a press conference Monday . " Last year at this time , we twice picked up the Meyer twins and that Craig Rothamer character who lives over in Mooreland . This year , I haven ' t seen hide nor hair of them down there . Not so much as a single blackberry brandy empty . "Long used as a secluded spot for illicit teenage drinking , the nation ' s quarries are slowly returning to their original function of mineral excavation . Reasons for the decrease in quarry drinking include incarceration of drinkers , induction into military service , and it being colder than a son of a bitch lately ." Well , I suppose with Brad Hightower in the Army now , and Jason Klaus marrying his pregnant ex girlfriend and working his ass off at the grain elevator , these kids ' party days are winding down , " said Sheriff John Pressman of Waushara County , WI . " Last week , one of my deputies did catch Bobby Hightower and Lee Olle over at the quarry with what looked like a Zima , but it turns out it was just a Pepsi Blue . Surprised the heck out of me , because the Hightowers are one hard drinking clan . They don ' t mean nothing by it they ' re good people . Why , I used to go with Brad Sr . ' s sister Bev back in high school . "Sheriffs attribute the decrease to numerous other factors , including Fanning Spring , FL , teen Jerry Kopecky breaking his leg at the go cart track Matt Biederhof of Okaton , SD , being so whipped by his new girlfriend that he scarcely hangs with his buds anymore and Robert Carey of Buckman , MN , violating probation after trying to dislodge several Homies figurines from a candy machine with a Dairy Queen spoon .Rural liquor stores are feeling the pinch , reporting lower sales than usual for such quarry staples as peppermint schnapps , malt liquor , and fortified wine ." Betty over at Friendly Liquor says the only suspicious thing she noticed all holiday season was the Feinske boy trying to buy Tom Jerry mix , " said Sheriff Hobart Baum of Clarion County , PA . " Probably thought there was alcohol in it . Well , what can you say , he ' s only 11 . "The decline in quarry drinking has also been cause for concern at Jack Daniel ' s , which recently unveiled " Hard Cola , " a product whose customer base is roughly 70 percent quarry drinkers . Attempting to adjust , Jack Daniel ' s is retooling the product ' s marketing campaign to target college binge drinkers , parking lot tipplers , and overweight secretaries on " Just Us Girls " after work outings ." Traditionally , sales of quarry beverages like Hard Cola ebb during the winter months , but we ' re seeing the same decline in more temperate climates , too , " Jack Daniel ' s spokeswoman Lynda Pfeiffer said . " We ' re optimistic about the future of Hard Cola , but we ' re also mindful of the toll taken on the wine cooler industry back in the early 1990s , when a similar quarry drinking drop off occurred . Bartles Jaymes never had a chance . "Despite the pervasiveness of the decline , some sheriffs are confident that the trend will begin to reverse itself when the weather warms ." Just yesterday , I caught that Dubrow kid and his buddy Glenn with an unopened Mickey ' s Big Mouth , " said Sheriff Gordon Leahy of Perry County , IL . " They claimed they found it on the ground while looking for arrowheads . Bullcrap . " 	 1
WASHINGTON Leaders from both parties announced Tuesday that Congress has voted to cut funding for its 26 year old stepson , Jeremy , whose education and living expenses have been federally subsidized since he and his mother moved in with the legislative branch in 1998 ." My colleagues and I realize this decision may not make us very popular , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R KY ) said of the measure that , effective June 1 , will halt the 975 in monthly aid for Jeremy ' s apartment in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington . " We have listened to Jeremy ' s concerns at length and truly sympathize with him , but with our national debt now exceeding 14 trillion , the American people simply cannot foot the bill for him any longer . "" There ' s no denying it these cuts are going to be painful , " McConnell continued . " But he ' s nearly 30 years old , for Christ ' s sake . Enough is enough . "The bill known as the C ' mon , Jeremy , It ' s Time to Grow Up and Start Thinking About Your Future Act will also end payments on the part time record store employee ' s 2008 Volkswagen Jetta . Though the legislation passed easily in both houses , some lawmakers deemed its language overly harsh , with Sen . Chuck Schumer ( D NY ) arguing unsuccessfully to provide a one time grant of 225 to pick up part of the airfare for Jeremy ' s trip to visit friends in Austin later this month .While many of the bill ' s supporters admitted they felt some remorse about their vote , most agreed Jeremy had been given more than enough chances to get his shit together .According to voting records , Congress has supported its stepson by , among other things , allocating an additional 25 million to the Peace Corps in 2003 , when Jeremy briefly expressed interest in joining the organization , and passing a 478 appropriations bill for high quality Japanese cooking knives when he was thinking about enrolling in culinary school four years ago ." We even got him a plum job as a page for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid a couple summers ago , but he didn ' t take it seriously at all , " said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D CA ) , estimating that over the past eight years , 150 , 000 in discretionary funds had been spent on Jeremy ' s as yet incomplete undergraduate studies . " We understand public service isn ' t for everyone , but he could have at least shown up on time and put on some dress shoes instead of those goddamn flip flops he wears all the time . "" I love the kid , but sometimes I wonder if he does these things just to spite us , " Pelosi added .President Obama , who in the past has described Jeremy as " a very charming young man , " is expected to sign the bill into law by the end of the week . On Tuesday , the administration confirmed its long held stance against any further bailouts of the congressional stepson ." Not only are these cuts necessary given budgetary constraints , but in the long run they ' re for Jeremy ' s own good , " White House press secretary Jay Carney said . " The president firmly believes that Jeremy will thank Congress for this tough love some day . "Some lawmakers were far more candid in their comments on Jeremy ' s current lifestyle . Rep . Peter King ( R NY ) told reporters that while the 26 year old will always be family , it ' s time for him to " quit dicking off " and start paying his own way ." We ' re not going to cosign any more leases for him , and he ' s definitely not moving back into the Capitol Building , " said King , who later added that Congress would gladly repeal the legislation if Jeremy would agree to go to law school and actually stick with it . " If he wants to be a bum , he can be a bum . "" And we love Jeremy ' s mother Helen , of course , but my God , the way she coddles him , " King continued . " It ' s no wonder he can barely wipe his own ass .

Corcoran State Prison , CA Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson has today been released from Corcoran State Prison for medical reasons , but will be confined to his home with an electronic ankle bracelet for 48 years .Reggie Dunbar , spokesperson from the prison , said that the California District Attorney ' s office granted Manson ' s release shortly after it was informed he had had a herpes rash that looked like a " swastika " on his forehead ." Poor Charlie , he was really embarrassed , I can ' t imagine the emotional scars this has left him with , " Dunbar added .The release of Manson has followed a mass exodus of prisoners from California prisons in what has been called , " The Herpes Defense . "Dunbar stated , " Once prisoners found out that a case of Herpes could get them them transferred to a home detention , the California prison population had a herpes outbreak that would rival USC ' s Fraternity Row , both of which came from the same source . "According to Dr Reggie Athansoulis for the Center of Disease Control , herpes traditionally effects one in eight Americans , or basically everyone in California ." It ' s not life threatening , " Athansoulis said , " but it certainly threatened the show , ' The Simple Life , ' where it originated . "The Herpes Defense has now become a part popular culture , with reports of it being used in every day life . Reggie Stanthorpe , from Media watchdog group , Media Connection UK recently said , " Herpes is like a modern day Moses , leading prisoners out of prison , getting people out of traffic fines , excusing kids for late assignments . It ' s no longer acceptable to blame traffic or ' the baby ' for running late for social functions , but it ' s perfectly acceptable now to blame herpes . " 	 1
Before pro Israel activists , the mogul jokes about stereotypes and the neurosurgeon mispronounces Hamas .Donald Trump ( above ) and Ben Carson ( below ) speak during the 2016 Republican Jewish Coalition Presidential Candidates Forum in Washington on Thursday . GettyThe GOP Loves Netanyahu As Much As ReaganDonald Trump joked about Jewish stereotypes , declined to affirm his support for a united Jerusalem , and told his audience they wouldn t back him because he did not want their money . Reading from a prepared text , Ben Carson repeatedly pronounced the name of the Palestinian group Hamas as if it were a delicious spread made with chickpeas .The performance of these two outsider candidates left attendees at Thursday s summit of the Republican Jewish Coalition amused , but not impressed . With the RJC , an influential group of donors and activists that prioritizes American policy toward Israel , the retired neurosurgeon and the businessman faced a more politically sophisticated crowd than either is used to , and one more concerned with the nuances of foreign policy .I don t think either one helped themselves particularly , said Ari Fleischer , former White House press secretary to George W . Bush , who attended the event .While many agreed with much of the substance of his Carson s speech , the neurosurgeon s decision to read from a prepared text and his repeated mispronunciations of Hamas only reinforced the perceptions of those in the hall that he does not fully grasp the complicated dynamics of the Middle East .Trump began the day in a hole with this crowd after questioning Israel s commitment to making peace with Palestine in an interview ahead of the summit . " A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ? whether or not Israel ' s willing to sacrifice certain things , " Trump told T he Associated Press of the prospects for peace in the region . " They may not be .His speech ? in which he joked about Hillary Clinton s interesting friendship with Muslim aide Huma Abedin , cited his appearance in a campaign ad for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and led with his daughter s Jewish husband ? kept the audience laughing and clapping throughout . It did not generate much political support .He s funny . And if I went to the Catskills for vacation , I d love to see him , New York attorney Eric Levine said of Trump . But as president , his lack of knowledge is disturbing to me . He s a circus act . Of Carson , Levine , who has given money to Marco Rubio , said , He s flat out scary . I think he s a wonderful man But he s totally vapid .As for Carson s mangling of Hamas , Levine found comic relief in it . I needed some carrots to dip , he said .Trump took a risk by winking at Jewish stereotypes , telling the crowd , I m a negotiator like you , folks , and , Is there anyone in this room who doesn t negotiate deals ? Probably more than any room I ve ever spoken . But throwing out political correctness worked for Trump here as it has throughout his campaign and the audience received the jokes warmly .Instead , it was Trump s suggestion that the people in the room would not support him because he did not want their money that raised hackles . It was offensive , said Fleischer . 	 0

Patients use different inhalers to combat an attack or keep the airways openThree out of four people with asthma are unaware they are at risk of a fatal attack because they wrongly believe their condition is under control , says a new survey .Alarming findings show 15 per cent of mild or moderate asthma sufferers have attended A E in the last year for symptoms , but still don ' t class their condition as uncontrolled .More than three quarters of these patients use up to one ' reliever ' asthma inhaler a week when they shouldn ' t need to get through one a month if their disease is well controlled .The survey of 464 asthma patients was carried out by Allergy UK and funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK .Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways , causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of breathlessness and wheezing that can be fatal .Patients use different inhalers to combat an attack or keep the airways open .At least 200 people are hospitalised because of their asthma every day in the UK , a total of 73 , 000 , with more than 1 , 000 dying .Around four million Britons need asthma medication , but Allergy UK estimates 2 . 7 million of those who consider their asthma to be mild or moderate , are at risk of life threatening attacks .Half of this group still suffer from breathlessness and 45 per cent from wheezing , despite regular medication .Around four million Britons need asthma medication , but Allergy UK estimates 2 . 7 million of those who consider their asthma to be mild or moderate , are at risk of life threatening attacksIn addition , nearly half of those who class their asthma as ' mild or moderate ' have been prescribed oral steroids in the past 12 months .Using this level of medication means the condition isn ' t under control , as it should only be necessary in an emergency , or in the most severe asthma cases .Lindsey McManus , the Deputy CEO of Allergy UK , said ' Asthma is a killer , with three people dying of it every day in the UK .More than three quarters of these patients use up to one asthma inhaler a week when they shouldn ' t need one a month if their disease is well controlled' These shocking survey results reflect what we hear time and time again from the people that call our helpline .' People ' put up with ' their asthma symptoms and continue to use medication that isn ' t treating the inflammation , rather than seeking help to get their asthma under control .' They just don ' t realise they are putting themselves in danger and could soon find themselves in A E . 'One in six of those who wrongly think their asthma is under control have taken six or more days off work or school in the past 12 months because of their asthma .At least 60 per cent of asthma is triggered by allergens , including house dust mite , pollen , animal dander , mould and foods , yet only a third of those surveyed had been allergy tested .Dr Monica Nordstrom , Respiratory Physician at Ashford and St . Peter ' s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said ' Doctors , nurses and patients themselves often fail to recognise whether asthma is moderate or severe , leading to life threatening attacks that could have been avoided with appropriate diagnosis and management . 'She said ' There are three warning signs for patients to look out for if you use more than one reliever inhaler a month if you ' ve been prescribed one or more courses of oral corticosteroids in the past 12 months or if you are consistently missing work or school because of your asthma these can all be signs that your asthma may be more severe than you think and you should seek more help from your doctor or specialist nurse . 'Over one in five asthma sufferers surveyed had not had an asthma review for over a year .Lindsey McManus , Allergy UK said ' Our biggest piece of advice is to talk to your doctor or asthma nurse .' They will conduct a thorough asthma review and may refer you to a specialist who may conduct an allergy assessment and review your asthma management .' This is the only way to ensure that the asthma crisis doesn ' t worsen . 'The NHS spends around 1billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma . 	 0
talk about ripping the heart out of a home or, in this case, a socking great country mansion in norfolk. anmer hall, the ten bedroom bolt hole that the duke and duchess of cambridge are renovating, until recently boasted one of those stunning, hand crafted kitchens that is the stuff of over excitable dreams. no luxury was spared : there was an 11, 000 aga, an 8, 000 fridge and inset belfast sinks. the floor space outstripped that of most entire homes, the work tops were gleaming hardwood, even the draining board cost 275. in short, it was the kind of room most families would die for. not the duchess. barely a week after we learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her kensington palace apartment, we hear that most of the 50, 000 kitchen at anmer is to go, in favour of the young royals'' own taste '. it is, of course, profligate madness and as far as harmful reputations go,'two jags prescott'could well be outstripped by'three kitchens kate '. not surprisingly, the widespread reaction on mail online yesterday was one of disbelief and fury.'to discard a new, serviceable kitchen is an utter waste and is not likely to endear them to a hard pressed public,'wrote a reader from worcestershire.'what they've forgotten or are insensitive to is that millions of their " subjects " still struggle to survive in britain,'said another. rose, from maidstone, though, spoke for me :'please, may i have the old kitchen?'and perhaps most pertinent of all, from jane in london :'the queen would consider that extremely wasteful.'barely a week after we learned that kate is having a second kitchen installed in her kensington palace apartment, we hear that most of the 50, 000 kitchen at anmer is to go, in favour of the young royals'' own taste'quite so. but the queen is an octogenarian who holds dear the austere values of her time. kate is both young and rich, and the truth is that we really should not be surprised that she loves to splash the cash. there is another reason : few people in the public eye are as'on trend'as is kate, and few trends have established themselves as rapidly as that which has made today's kitchen the most fashionable of contemporary status symbols. outstripping cars, pools, tennis courts and all the rest of the visibly extravagant paraphernalia available, the kitchen now is paramount. nothing demonstrates the stylish qualities of one's'own taste'quite as definitively as the area of the house where dirty pots and pans are made clean again. nobody worth their maldon sea salt buys a new home and lives with ugh the'taste'of the previous owner. inevitably, no sooner has the removal van left than the old units, fridge and manky hobs are quickly torn out and a skip arrives to carry them off. sometimes, the daftness beggars belief. and in the case of kate and william, their decision to replace a gorgeous 50, 000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20 plus rooms at kensington palace which has quadrupled from its estimate to 4 million. in the case of kate and william, their decision to replace a gorgeous 50, 000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20 plus rooms at kensington palace which has quadrupled from its estimate to 4 millioneven though the couple paid for most of the fixtures and fittings as well they should, since william is a millionaire courtesy of his mother diana's inheritance the bill for their son george's nursery has been picked up by taxpayers. the fripperies that, once, kate seemed to eschew also seem to be mounting. a nice little trip to the five star cheval blanc resort in the maldives? a 6, 500 a night rest break, laid on for them during their three week tour of the southern hemisphere? that'll do nicely, they have apparently decided. none, by themselves, appear too shocking. but added up? it's not a good look. then, of course, there's that second kitchen at her kensington palace apartment. anmer hall, the ten bedroom bolt hole that the duke and duchess of cambridge are renovating, until recently boasted the stunning, hand crafted kitchenthis trend for swanky kitchens, like so many others, is based on a strange inverted snobbery. among the wealthy classes, the kitchen used to be the domain of servants rarely, if ever, would the mistress of the house descend the stairs and absolutely never the master. yet now, even high up 	 0
detroit lions : detroit has the worst qbr in the nfl and is facing an aaron rodgers led team that has lost two straight games and is returning to lambeau field and wisconsin, where the lions have not won since 1991. considering this lions team has the worst record in the nfl, the no. 26 offense and defense in the league and has lost all of its games away from ford field by an average of 13. 25 points, there shouldn't be much confidence this is the year the streak ends. packers 38, lions 20. michael rothsteingreen bay packers : despite coming off back to back losses, the oddsmakers say the packers are the biggest favorites on the week 10 schedule at between 11. 5 and 13 points. perhaps it's because the packers haven't lost three consecutive starts by aaron rodgers since 2008. or maybe it's because the lions never win in wisconsin, the last time being 1991. better detroit teams than this haven't been able to win here, so why would a 1 7 group do it? packers 32, lions 20. rob demovskydallas cowboys : the cowboys are in the midst of their longest losing streak since 1989. a loss sunday to the tampa bay buccaneers probably would force the cowboys to be perfect once tony romo returns to the field. they might need to be perfect even if they win sunday. to get that elusive win, the cowboys will have to grind it out. in the buccaneers'five losses, their opponent has run the ball at least 32 times on four occasions. last week, the new york giants ran the ball 33 times for 114 yards. they were persistent. the cowboys'running game finally has found its legs the past three weeks, with darren mcfadden picking up 333 yards. this game won't be easy. the buccaneers will force the cowboys to go the long way without the big play. after being so close to wins the past three games, the cowboys will be glad to take home an ugly w. cowboys 20, bucs 16. todd archertampa bay buccaneers : if the bucs correct their red zone issues, they should be in good shape against a struggling cowboys squad that needs tony romo back as soon as possible. tampa bay has scored touchdowns on only 42. 86 percent of trips inside the opponent's 20 yard line this season, and the bucs were 1 for 4 in the red zone against the giants in week 9. jameis winston has gone four consecutive games without throwing an interception, and there's little reason to think he'll regress against a dallas defense that has been vulnerable in recent weeks. it will be close throughout, but the bucs will do enough late to gain the victory at home. buccaneers 21, cowboys 17. andrew astlefordcarolina panthers : the panthers rank second in the nfl in holding opposing quarterbacks to a total quarterback rating of 41. 9 and rank fourth in the league in sacks with 25. they will bring the pressure on rookie quarterback marcus mariota, who doesn't have a solid running game and has been sacked 19 times in six games. barring a letdown, this one shouldn't come down to the final possession for a change. panthers 24, titans 13. david newtontennessee titans : the titans'defense has been far better against the pass than the run this season, and with cam newton in the mix a key missed tackle or two could be a big factor. en route to 8 0, the panthers have given up an average of 20 points a game. the titans will have trouble topping that against a defense with talent all over the field. panthers 24, titans 17. paul kuharskychicago bears : this would be chicago's biggest win of the year. but the jury is still out whether the bears can beat a decent team on the road? despite st. louis'limitations on offense, todd gurley is a beast, and the bears do a poor job stopping the run. meanwhile, the rams'physical defense is bound to hit jay cutler. this could get ugly for chicago's offensive line. rams 23, bears 20. jeff dickersonst. louis rams : this has the feeling of a dangerous game for the rams, who are coming off a disappointing overtime loss and will see a huge amount of bears fans in the edward jones dome. but chicago's no. 9 defensive ranking is a little misleading. chicago's offense has the fourth highest time of possession in the nfl, which is effective at limiting how much the defense is on the field. it's a fine formula, except the bears haven't beaten a defense as good as the one they will see sunday. the bears are 27th in the nfl in run defense, giving up 4. 63 yards per carry, which should allow rams running back todd gurley to break a big one or two. that, combined with a rams defense that dominated a more talented adam 	 0
News that many police officers in the UK have to take on secondary jobs has led to further announcements by Tony Blair in Parliament ." I have given Home Secretary Charles Clarke carte blanche to get things moving . We cannot have vehicles standing idle while officers are having tea breaks , filling in forms , or being off sick . " The vehicles can earn us money , which can be added to the millions gleaned from speeding motorists , " he announced during Prime Minister ' s question time yesterday . " Not that the man on the beat will see any benefit , of course , " he was then heard to whisper .The new government initiatives have recently been put into operation and they are currently making their presence felt in many small towns .As from 1st February , all new road traffic patrol cars have to be available for multi tasking . This will lead to police cars with a new appearance . Gone are the traditional " jam sandwich " stripes along the side , now replaced by new sponsored artwork . As well as spending time patrolling local roads to make them safer , the cars are to become available to driver learning schools , taxi companies , and pizza delivery concerns . One local police inspector commented : " The cars will have to conform to a strict time table so that they are not being used for two tasks simultaneously ." Only officers with the relevant experience will take on primary policing tasks ." It is obvious that we cannot have the situation of a highly trained police officer delivering pizzas . Neither do we wish to have pizza delivery staff apprehending drivers who are parking illegally . We ' re supposed to do that ! " he claimed . " Local drug dealers and murderers will welcome the new initiative , " he added . One officer , who asked to remain anonymous , said he was worried about teaching youngsters how to drive to the limit of the vehicle and then having to arrest them for " speeding " while in his car . He also said he was unsure about speeding while delivering pizzas ." I am waiting for definitive guidelines from the officers who wrote the programme , " he commented . " I fear that it will be left to the British bobby to sort it out for himself , " he concluded . 	 1
chocolate city after months of ceaseless debate, including last week's record 76 hour filibuster slap bass solo from senate rubber band minority leader bootsy collins ( d oh ), the national funk congress is no closer to resolving its deadlock over the controversial " get up get down " issue, insiders reported monday. " get up uh, get on up! get up uh, get on up! " shouted getuplican party supporters on the steps of the capitol as the debate, as well as a massive 14 piece instrumental jam, raged within. the pro up getting demonstrators'chants were nearly drowned out by those of a nearby group of jungle boogie downocrats, who called upon all citizens to " get down, get down! " the bitter " get up get down " battle, which has polarized the nation's funk community, is part of a long running battle between the two factions, rooted in more than 35 years of conflict over the direction in which the american people should shake it. " the time has come to face facts : to move forward, we've got to get on up, and stay on the scene, like a sex machine, " said brick house majority leader james brown ( g ga ), one of getting on up's most vocal supporters. " say it loud : only when we have gotten up offa that thing will we, as a nation, finally get back on the good foot. " upon learning of brown's remarks, downocratic leaders openly questioned his commitment to getting up. said robert " kool " bell, a top ranking brick house downocrat : " it is a well known fact that brown has, on many past occasions, urged his supporters to get down with they bad selves. in response to his inconsistent voting record and history of waffling on this crucial issue, we will not rest until every american, as is their birthright, has gotten down. " " you got to get down, " bell added. " hyuh! " the disagreement, which has paralyzed all efforts of the national funk congress to get it together and get funky for one and all, has reached crisis proportions, experts say. " until our country's funky leaders can resolve this deadlock, u. s. funk leadership, and the booties of all americans, will remain immobilized, " said gregory tate, domestic motorbooty affairs reporter for the washington funkenquarterly. " unless a compromise can be reached soon, the entire nation's thang could be in serious jeopardy. " " our leaders'refusal to budge, let alone move it from front to back, has crippled the move your body politic, " said current u. s. mothership ambassador george clinton, one of the most outspoken critics of the deadlock. " these legislators must keep it real and understand that no matter what party policy may dictate, they cannot fake the funk. what the partisan people in the house need to realize is this : if they ain't gon'get along, the time has come for them to take they dead ass home. " but despite such pleas for bipartisan compromise, the two parties remain at odds. this week, a getuplican high treble scratch guitar initiative called for all downocrats to " give it up and turn it loose, " sparking an angry war of words on the senate dance floor. in response, the downocratic members of the grooves booties subcommittee drafted a bass heavy resolution demanding that the initiative be voted " down, down, all the way down. " the getuplican downocratic rift has been further complicated by confusing rhetoric from both sides. a call from parliamentary leaders to " get up for the down stroke " was interpreted by members of both parties as a statement of support. equally unclear was a statement made earlier this week by funky chinatown big boss elect carl douglas, who baffled observers with the assertion that funky chinamen were " chopping men up and chopping men down. " for all the confusion and divisiveness, there are signs of hope. a bipartisan coalition of funky drummers is gaining strength, urging downocrats and getuplicans to find common ground by " getting together, on the one. " also on the rise is a small grass roots campaign calling upon party people not to get up or down, but simply to get it on. whether any of these fledgling reform movements will have a genuine impact on the entrenched groove machine is uncertain. one thing, however, is not : a growing number of citizens are fed up with the nation's current leadership for putting party politics before the need of the people to turn this mother out. " big government has lost sight of the fact that we should not be divided along getuplican and downocratic lines, but should be one nation under a groove, 	 1

At an emergency press conference today , a shocked and embarrassed US President , Barack Obama , announced that China has just delivered him an eviction notice for the entire country ." Wow " , exclaimed a shocked Obama . " This is a real bummer . I mean , man , we never saw this coming , although , I guess if we would have read all the foreclosure notices that they sent us to appear in front of the World Court to argue our case , but , " . . well , who has time to read that crap ? Heck , I just learned how to twitter today . Now isn ' t that amazing " .When pressed about the foreclosure notices that the US president , as well as the entire Senate received , Obama replied :" Heck , when we borrowed that , what ? Ten dollars ? Ten dollars and ninety five cents from China . Wasn ' t that the amount we borrowed ? Hell why don ' t we just round it off to eleven bucks " ." At the time of the loan , they told us that they wanted to be repaid in full within a year , but , hey , you know how it goes , we ' re fricken ' Congress , we don ' t listen to anybody , except our lobbyist , of course . You know the saying : ' show me the money bunny ' " ." Geeez , all this over a measley ten bucks " , continued Obama . " I could get dinner for four at a Chinese restaurant for ten bucks . Hell , I could hire six illegal aliens to replace my roof for ten bucks " ." Now , China , actually , wants their money back ! They have an injunction from the World Court that has thrown the entire US into Chinese ownership . They want us out of the country within thirty days ! I don ' t see any provisions in here that let us all work as Chinese restaurant delivery people " ." What is really bad " , said a stunned John McCain , " is that we had all received the foreclosure notices by certified mail from the World Court and , honestly , not one of us read them . If we had read them , we could have gone to the World Court and defended ourselves , but , then again , reading sucks . That is why we have twitter , so you can say intellectual things such as : i c u p " ." Think about this " , interjected Senator Harry Reid from Nevada . " When you consider the fact that not one of us read any of the agreements or court orders , should tell you something . It should tell you that we are complete idiots .

erie, pa after finishing his big bacon classic combo, area resident and wendy's patron don turnbee, 38, expressed uncertainty monday regarding what to do with all the extra ketchup packets. " i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do with all these, " said turnbee, gesturing toward the pile of seven to ten ketchup packets on his tray. " i guess i could give them back to the guy at the counter, but i don't know if he'd take them. they'd probably be considered used. " added turnbee : " i touched them, but they're not opened or anything. " turnbee said he requested the extra packets upon placing his order, which included a ketchup necessitating biggie fries. the cashier, ricky nunez, 41, responded by reaching below the counter and tossing a large fistful of packets onto turnbee's tray. " i knew it was too many ketchups, because i usually only need three or four for my biggie fries, " turnbee said. " but i just took them anyway. " compounding his sense of guilt is the fact that the condiment bar at the buffalo road wendy's features a ketchup pump, eliminating the need for packets altogether. " i didn't see the pump thing, so i just asked for ketchup with my order, " turnbee said. " pretty much all the fast food places have the pumps the packets are usually just for drive thru and to go orders. " turnbee said he is leaning toward bringing the packets home with him. he noted, however, that he would have little use for them. " i could bring them home, but there's already a ton of them there, " said turnbee, who has an estimated 350 packets of heinz, hunt's, and generic " fancy " grade ketchup in his kitchen pantry. " somehow, wherever i go, i always wind up with lots of extra ketchup packets. " over the past year, turnbee has made numerous attempts to avail himself of the excess ketchup, including making it available to colleagues at his place of work. " i once tried to put them in the breakroom so people eating lunch could help themselves, " turnbee said. " but a couple weeks later, i noticed hardly any had been taken. when i asked people why they weren't taking any, they said they didn't need ketchup or had ketchups from their own fast food meals. " as for returning the kitchen pantry packets to their various restaurants of origin, turnbee demurred. " i was going to do it, but i thought it would look weird handing a big box of ketchups to a manager, " turnbee said. " maybe i could leave them at someplace's drive up after they close. but then they'd just throw them away. " " i wish someone would take these off my hands, " turnbee continued. " a few fell out of my glove compartment onto the floor of my car the other day, and turnbee's son devin stepped on them and mushed them into the carpet. " the situation was exacerbated last thursday, when turnbee purchased an 18 ounce bottle of heinz ketchup while grocery shopping. having temporarily forgotten that he possessed a three year plus supply of the condiment in the form of single serving packets, turnbee invoked the wrath of his wife shelly. " i said to him not two days ago,'don, don't you dare bring home any more ketchup, because it's practically coming out of our ears,'" shelly turnbee said. " so what does he do? he buys more ketchup! he said the bottle in the fridge was almost empty. well, of course it was almost empty : there was no need to replace it, since we had half a million ketchup packets overflowing our pantry. and we couldn't return the new bottle, either, because he'd already opened it. " though the ketchup collection shows no signs of diminishing, turnbee said he feels simply discarding the packets would be wasteful. " i guess i'll just have to bring ketchups with me whenever i go to a fast food place, " turnbee said. " and i'll need to make sure the employees don't sneak any into my bag. i just hope i can remember to do that otherwise, i'll wind up with even more. " in addition to ketchup packets, the turnbee pantry is crammed with hundreds of other restaurant condiments. among them are single serving packets of taco bell " mild " sauce, arby's horsey sauce, soy sauce from the wok'n'roll at millcreek mall, 	 1
TILDEN , OH A article just published in the October issue of Cat Fancy magazine blasts local kitten Mr Paws , calling him " far from purr fect " and a " cat aclysmic failure . "" Unlike the typical feline that appears in Cat Fancy , Mr Paws does not behave in a manner that can in any way be considered adorable or cuddly , " said Neil Kilmer , Cat Fancy features editor and cat enthusiast . " During the entire time I observed Mr Paws , not once did he climb into a paper bag and stick his head out quizzically . Nor did he ever unroll any lengths of ribbon or yarn , afterwards innocently looking up from the entangled mess as if to say , ' Who , me ? ' Finally , if that weren ' t enough , he never fell off the edge of a tree branch , gripping it precariously with his fuzzy little paws and ' hanging in there , ' so to speak . "" Unfortunately , " Kilmer concluded , " Mr Paws appears to be totally devoid of any ' purr sonality ' whatsoever . He couldn ' t possibly be any ' fur ther ' from the caliber of kitty that Cat Fancy usually showcases . "Mr Paws ' owner , Helen Smallings , strongly disagreed with Cat Fancy ' s assessment of her pet . " I really love Mr Paws and he loves me . Don ' t you , Mr Pawsy Wawsy ? " said Smallings , a single , slightly overweight , 38 year old part time secretary . " He ' s his own little man ! "As a result of the scathing Cat Fancy article , whenever Mr Paws leaps to bask in the warmth of one of the front windowsills , Smallings is forced to close the blinds to protect him from the jeers and laughter of the neighbors ." I read that piece on Mr Paws in the latest Cat Fancy we all did , " neighbor Paula Corcoran said . " That kitten is crap . "Despite his harsh words for Mr Paws , Kilmer admitted the kitten ' s lack of cuddliness may have been in part circumstantial . " A kitten benefits from the presence of deep shag rugs that offset its fur color and fish bowls to peer into bewilderedly or bat excitedly , things Mr Paws lacks , " he said . " In addition , there are no beagles on site next to whom Mr Paws can curl up and fall asleep . Now , wouldn ' t that be cute ? "In response to Kilmer , Smallings said , " Just the other day , Mr Paws was on the couch all stretched out , and I put the remote control next to his paw . It was the cutest thing ! "Cat Fancy said it could not consider the cute pose in its evaluation of the animal without at least a Polaroid of it , or , ideally , an 8x10 glossy photo enclosed in a light blue frame with kitties chasing a ball of pink yarn around its perimeter .A similarly persuasive photo , according to Cat Fancy , would depict Mr Paws doing one of the following : wearing a pair of sunglasses curling up inside a country western hat " kissing " a jack o ' lantern or dripping wet after falling into the sink , looking like he was having " One Of Those Days ! "Evaluating an appeal from Smallings at a special meeting in the Persian Room , Cat Fancy ' s Editorial Board determined yesterday that " Mr Paws is most definitely a ' cat astrophe . ' "" Sometimes a decidedly unsnuggly cat is redeemed by its air of grandiosity and haughtiness , " board member Joyce Reamish said . " Such is the case with our Cat Pic of the Month , a Siamese named Sheba from Grand Forks , ND . Sheba was photographed while poised on a mahogany table bathed in natural sunlight , the garden just beyond the window . The look on her face is 100 percent sassy . Mr Paws , on the other hand , is sassless . "" Age is certainly an issue with this particular feline , " Kilmer said . " Before long , Mr Paws will have passed through the prime stage of kittenhood fuzziness , out of both the adorably awkward period of quick growth and the rambunctious , playful months . "" Within a year he will likely be a sedate and reclusive adult cat that ' s sadly overweight in the midsection , a condition only acceptable on the matronly long hair breeds . Mr Paws ' condition is truly ' a paw ling . ' "In a final indictment of the sub par pet , Kilmer added : " Get this ' fur ociously ' inferior feline ' me out ' of my sight ! " 	 1
GOP candidate for president Mr Donald Trump is currently taking himself to court in a suit against his own mouth and its insinuations .Mr Trump indicates he might be persuaded to call off the suit ( with sufficient monetary compensation ) , but only in the event his mouth curbs itself from future " dark barbs in the direction of an opponent , " affecting his candidacy .At issue at this time is Mr Trump ' s remark aimed at Hillary Clinton involving the second amendment :" Hillary wants to abolish the second amendment . By the way , if she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do , folks . Although the second amendment people , maybe there is . I don ' t know . " Mr Trump ' s remark has been interpreted in a range from he meant " if so , you second amendment people really need to get out to vote against her " to " if so , you second amendment people , with your guns , could put a stop to her . "A considerable manure storm has developed , relating to other possibly innocent comments from Mr Trump , including " knock the crap out of him " and " I wanted to hit him so hard his head would spin , literally . "In short , his mouth ( which Mr Trump denies responsibility for ) has suggested he favors violence for political solutions .A medical team headed by Dr Phillip Swinigan ( pronounced " swine again " ) has determined Mr Trump ' s verbal problems belong to the field of " eruptometrics , " which includes ore furo ( " mouth run amok " ) and de lingua imperium ( " tongue out of control " ) .Mr Trump ' s specific ailment is known as ejaculadis mentis , or " Jack Cade Disease . "This illness was first brought to light by Shakespeare in his Henry VI , part 2 , with the character Jack Cade , a rabble rouser , who anticipated Mr Trump as with , " My mouth shall be the parliament of England " ( IV , vii , 11 12 ) .Mr Trump has voiced admiration for this character , telling Bill O ' Reilly of Fox News that he likes the idea that " My mouth could be , you know , the controller of the United States , and the globe in general . "However , Mr Trump also acknowledges that , at times , his mouth descends toward " too mouthy , " which takes up his time defending and correcting .He told Mr O ' Reilly , " It ' s like having an infant that ' s too often rebelling against me , and needs a good dose of the belt . "Hence to his lawsuit , which he hopes will be adjudicated by someone with an Anglo Saxon name , if possible . 	 1

PALM BEACH GARDENS , FL The huge upsurge in golfing among black youth that Tiger Woods ' success most likely initiated in the mid 1990s probably should have inspired thousands of young African Americans , all of whom really ought to have turned up by now , professional golf officials announced Friday ." We ' re almost certain that a whole new breed of hungry , contemporary , up and coming urban golfer should be emerging right now , " PGA director of player development Paul Metzler said . " We don ' t really see any evidence of that , but given the buzz around Tiger Woods , a significant groundswell in golf almost certainly went through the black community like wildfire around 10 or 15 years ago . I can ' t for the life of me understand why the cream of black America ' s golfing crop isn ' t making the SportsCenter highlight reel right now . "In fact , according to PGA Tour statistics , there are fewer black golfers on the tour now than there were at the time of Tiger ' s birth in 1975 , a fact the organization described as " baffling . "" We know Tiger Woods was just one golfer , but he was the best golfer we had for a long time , " PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said . " You ' d think that his story , which made so many of us believe the color barrier in golf had been dismantled forever , would have made a lot of young black kids think so too . I can ' t imagine why it did not . "" Oh , we got that other black guy , too , " Finchem added . " Branson ? Bramlett ? Joseph Bramlett , that ' s him . So we ' re sort of on our way , I guess . "Still , some golf insiders are less than surprised at the sport ' s inability to attract young black kids , saying that besides the access to facilities , equipment , and huge swaths of free time needed to excel at the demanding sport , there may in fact be more attractive athletic opportunities for black kids ." I think the golf world was expecting Tiger Woods to be the Serena and Venus Williams of golf , introducing a whole new community to a sport it might have for whatever reason thought was exclusionary or even hostile towards them , " Sports Illustrated ' s Michael Bamberger said . " Which is a nice idea , but also rather shortsighted , as it ' s not like the tennis world is awash in young black kids , either . "" Of course , you could make a case that black golfers face an uphill battle , as historically they were not allowed to join many of the sport ' s premier clubs or play on its premier courses , but Tiger ' s ascendancy changed all that , " Metzler said . " At least , we ' ve always assumed it did . We frankly have no idea why we aren ' t seeing hordes of young black golfers follow his lead by getting recruited to play at Stanford , going pro on their first try , winning their first major within a year , and establishing a significant and permanent black presence on the American golf scene . "" I also wish to stress the fact that PGA members and fans do not find that prospect threatening in the least , " Metzler added . 	 1
Most anyone who has snacked on a Samoa or thrown down a Thin Mint knows they can be hard to resist .But selling them ? One Girl Scout in Oklahoma has found that she , too , just can ' t get enough .Having broken her state record for cookie sales two years running , Katie Francis did herself and everyone else , ever one better this year by selling more than 18 , 000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies .The Girl Scouts , of course , are about more than baked goods . Since its founding in Savannah , Georgia , in 1912 , the group has grown in its mission to give millions of young women a forum to build " courage , confidence and character , " according to its website .That said , especially in recent decades and perhaps especially for those not directly involved in scouting beyond buying a box the Girl Scouts have also become synonymous with Do si dos , Tagalongs , Trefoils and other popular cookies . Selling them is important to local councils , bringing in money that ' s used to offer scouting opportunities for some , maintain camps and the like .Cookie sales ' importance is one reason why , every year , you can reliably see Girl Scouts out and about asking you to buy a box .Katie Francis , though , officially took salesmanship to a whole new level ." Katie is an example of the entrepreneurial spirit and can do attitude that exemplifies Girl Scouts , " the organization ' s CEO , Anna Maria Chavez , said Tuesday .In her four years as a cookie selling scout , the member of Troop No . 3469 has always been a big time seller . This time around , she decided to go even bigger aiming for not just a state record , but a world record .Why ? Her mother , DeLee Francis , told KOCO admits , " It ' s very time consuming , and it takes a lot of energy , and a lot of adrenaline . "Thankfully , the northwest Oklahoma City resident doesn ' t seem to be lacking in the energy or eagerness department ." Cookie selling is just so much fun for me , " Katie said .For three weeks , every day after school and on weekends , she pitched her products door to door . After that , Katie set up booths at hot spots and stores around Oklahoma City . Every step was monitored , such that if the hourly sales goal wasn ' t met , she and her mother would head somewhere else .Sometimes the cookies practically sold themselves . But the 12 year old also offered incentives , like drawings for prizes , and a little song and dance to lure customers .Katie recalled : " Some people bought cookies only because they saw me singing . "When she found out she ' d broken the record dating to the 1980s , Katie said she was the one dancing , she was so excited . What this achievement did not do , however , was break her cookie selling groove .In fact , she ' s still at it .Katie hopes to smash the 20 , 000 cookie mark before the official end date for cookie sales on Sunday , March 30 . To put this milestone in perspective , nationally each Girl Scout sells 150 boxes a year on average .She and her mom have wagons and a hatchback car packed with shortbread cookies and Savannah Smiles , looking for customers . They ' re also keeping in mind what Katie says are the three ingredients for cookie selling success .As she explained : " It takes a lot of time , commitment and asking everybody that I see . " 	 0

HANGZHOU , CHINA According to a disturbing report released Thursday by the Species Survival Network , Chinese poachers have slaughtered more than 280 endangered Yao Mings this year , pushing the majestic creatures to the brink of extinction .The 385 page report revealed that despite international efforts to protect the native Asian species , Yao Mings have recently faced an increased threat from the illegal wildlife trade , as poachers prize the massive yet serene land mammals for their valuable body parts , skin , and glands ." During June and July alone , Chinese poachers butchered 116 Yao Mings in the mountainous Zhejiang province , " said William Travers , chair of the Species Survival Network board . " What ' s even more alarming is that September marks the beginning of the Yao Ming rutting season , and the sweet tempered primates will be less cautious and at even greater risk of falling prey to hunters . "" Poachers could potentially massacre thousands of Yao Mings traveling to their ancient breeding grounds searching for mates , " Travers added . " It ' s tragic that anyone would hurt a gentle , intelligent , and beautiful Yao Ming that wants nothing more than to peacefully eat leaves from the trees . "A full grown adult male Yao Ming , which can stand up to 7 feet 6 inches tall and possesses an enormous wingspan of nearly 2 and a half meters , can fetch up to 50 , 000 on the black market .Although the Chinese government banned the trade of Yao Mings in 2002 , the SSN report confirmed that demand has risen dramatically , largely because the skin of a Yao Ming is a popular material for jackets , shoes , and purses ." They ' re so long and tall that the skin from a single Yao Ming can yield up to 45 designer handbags , " Travers said . " Sadly , this situation has arisen because Chinese poachers can make more money from killing one Yao Ming than they could by working in a factory for 10 years . "According to the Global Yao Ming Conservation Authority , today there are fewer than 17 , 000 Yao Mings in China , down from 1 . 8 million in 2005 . Hunters reportedly wiped out much of the population by needlessly taking the lumbering herbivores as trophies , oftentimes mounting their heads as decorations or using their enormous feet for wastebaskets ." Yao Mings are trusting , social , and playful , so hunters often lure them into a trap by tempting their curiosity with a bouncing basketball , " SSN treasurer Adam Roberts said . " And when the trap is set , they hack at them with machetes . Sometimes poachers cruelly wrench out all the teeth while the badly injured Yao Ming is still alive .Though the Chinese government has set aside a 250 , 000 acre wilderness reserve for the species , poaching remains difficult to control , in part because many people believe that Yao Ming genitalia have therapeutic properties ." It is quite common for Chinese men to use Yao Ming penises in traditional medicine , grinding them up into a fine powder and brewing a penis tea in hopes of increasing their virility , " said Roberts , who has helped rescue and nurse back to health 15 Yao Mings that had their penises removed by poachers . " It ' s such a waste of precious life and money . People quickly learn that you can ' t improve your sex life by sipping on a hot beverage made from dried Yao Ming penis . "The SSN issued a statement this week urging consumers to boycott illegal products made from Yao Mings ." The best way to help us stop the merciless killing of these tender creatures is by refusing to eat Yao Mings or wear apparel made from Yao Mings , " the statement read in part . " And certainly do not try to keep a Yao Ming as a pet . " 	 1
new tests suggest how a contaminant in heparin a blood thinner may be connected to dozens of deaths, fda officials said monday. jin shaohong, a chinese health official, says he doubts china is to blame for the heparin problem. the food and drug administration has " now established a mechanism by which we think this contaminant could cause these adverse events, " said dr janet woodcock, director of the fda's center for drug evaluation and research. she said contaminated shipments of the blood thinner have been traced from china to 10 countries, including the united states. " contamination of the heparin supply is a worldwide problem, " she said. heparin containing oversulfated chondroitin sulfate a compound made from animal cartilage has been associated with hundreds of serious adverse symptoms, including allergic reactions that cause nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath and a severe drop in blood pressure. in addition, the fda has tallied 81 deaths related to those symptoms in the united states, though no causal link has been determined. the severe reactions seem to be related to patients who were given high doses of the drug, woodcock said. she said she would not detail the suspected problems with the contaminant in heparin until the information is published in scientific literature and other researchers have had a chance to weigh in on the matter. contaminated heparin has been discovered in china, australia, canada, denmark, france, italy, japan, the netherlands, new zealand, germany and the united states. germany and the united states are the only countries that have linked adverse events to the drug, but cases in other countries may have gone unnoticed, woodcock said. still, agency officials stressed monday that they cannot be sure the deaths are linked to the drug, which is made from pig intestines and is given to prevent clot formation. " we are not able to rule out the fact that there could be other problems leading to these adverse events, " woodcock said. earlier monday, chinese officials said they were doubtful a contaminant in heparin was responsible for the bad reactions, according to the associated press. they said the contamination might have occurred in the united states during the manufacturing process or patients may have had conditions that caused the symptoms. watch dr sanjay gupta explain the controversy over heparin " we are aware that our chinese colleagues are skeptical that such a link has been established, " woodcock said. " we are hoping for further scientific dialogue with them in the next few weeks to present the data. " the raw ingredient for heparin sold by baxter international and ordered recalled came from scientific protein laboratories, a wisconsin company that owns changzhou spl co. ltd. the fda posted on its web site a warning letter to changzhou spl. the letter said the company has not instituted proper safeguards to ensure the raw materials are free of impurities. " you fail to have adequate systems for evaluating the suppliers of heparin crude materials, and the crude materials themselves to ensure that these materials are acceptable for use, " the letter said. it also cited equipment used in the manufacture of heparin as " unsuitable for intended use. " for example, it said, tanks used to make heparin " were identified as clean, " but " unidentified material was observed adhering to the inside surfaces. " shipments of the company's materials made at the plant will be refused admission into the united states until the matter is corrected, the letter said. " we regret fda's decision to send a warning letter to changzhou spl, and we don't believe that the warning letter reflects changzhou spl's actual state of compliance with current good manufacturing practices, " spl said in a written statement. it added that it is " committed to cooperating with fda and will promptly provide a detailed response. " in a written statement, baxter said its tests confirmed that the contaminant can cause drops in blood pressure, the most commonly reported adverse event. " that means that the contaminant, which was introduced at the workshop of consolidator level, before it reached our api active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier and before it reached baxter, is likely the cause of the increased adverse reactions to the heparin, " said norbert riedel, the company's chief scientific officer. because no method existed to test for the contaminant, the fda last month developed one, and regulators are now confident current u. s. supplies of the drug are safe, woodcock said. it remains unclear where the contamination occurred, but the contaminated products'active pharmaceutical ingredient came from 12 chinese makers of crude heparin " across a broad area of china, " she said. the most persuasive evidence implicating the chinese product, she said, is the fact that the increased number of deaths reported after heparin administration returned to baseline in 	 0
washington, jan. 12 ( xinhua ) u. s. president barack obama kicked off the new year on a positive note, touting the various strides the country has taken under his leadership, and telling a story that contrasts sharply from the narrative espoused by republicans. the state of the union speech tuesday night was the u. s. president's chance to address the nation about his concerns and highlight the initiatives he will push over the next 12 months. the address came as obama has one more year in office, and after seven years of bitter partisan rivalry. turning to foreign policy, he said fighting islamic state ( is ) radicals is the nation's foreign policy priority, although he downplayed the strength of the fanatical group, which has overrun vast swaths of turf in the middle east and conducted terror attacks on the west. the is does not " threaten our national existence, " obama said, adding that " we don't need to build them up to show that we're serious. " still, republican presidential candidates battling it out for their party's nomination for the 2016 white house race tell a different story. while the official unemployment rate is down, many economists said the labor force participation rate a measure that shows how many people in the country are participating in the workforce is down to a low not seen in decades. some economists said what the obama administration has touted as a recovery from the economic downturn is in fact not a robust recovery and has fallen short of other strong recoveries from recessions in past decades. the speech also came amid republican party ( gop ) and critics'concerns that u. s. foreign policy is weak under the obama administration, which they argue has emboldened terror groups such as the is. other critics contend the u. s. air strikes against the is are half hearted at best and too few and infrequent compared to other u. s. air wars over the last 20 years, and noted that the speech contained no mention of recent deadly attacks in paris and california. giving the official republican response, governor of south carolina and rising gop star nikki haley told the nation in a television address that the u. s. faces a dire threat from is, and accused obama of downplaying the problem. haley mentioned the " erosion " of public trust of leadership, but acknowledged that republicans also play a role and need to fix it. she also noted that there are many americans who are angry and frustrated over the economy, which are still sluggish even years after the official recovery from the recession. experts said obama's speech, which lacked specific proposals, seeks to set the agenda for the next president as the country is entering an election year. " he did not lay out a traditional policy agenda but emphasized broad themes and objectives. he sought to set the agenda of the next president, " brookings institution's senior fellow darrell west told xinhua. " he painted a rosier picture than gop candidates and showed how much progress has been made. at the same tune, he recognizes the economic anxiety that remains around the country and urged congress to improve education for all, " west said. christopher galdieri, assistant professor at saint anselm college in new hampshire, said much of the obama speech " was an implicit rebuttal to republican campaign rhetoric. " galdieri told xinua that obama was " arguing that when it comes to the economy, america's place in the world, foreign policy, and civil rights, among other issues, things are much better than they were in 2009. " dan mahaffee, an analyst with the center for the study of the presidency and congress, said that obama's speech " wove together what he sees as the accomplishments in his time in office, as well as an attempt to bring perspective to the threats and challenges this nation faces. " " however there remains a lot of daylight between parties on that issue, and while he may lament a lack of bipartisanship in washington, there are many republicans and some independents who will not be reassured by what he said, " mahaffee told xinhua. julian zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at princeton university, told xinhua that obama made " a very tough political speech attacking the style of politics his opponents practice and rejecting their narrative about the past eight years. " obama's final state of the union speech : much talk, few proposalswashington, jan. 13 ( xinhua ) u. s. president barack obama on tuesday night made his final state of the union speech predominated by political talk instead of specific proposals as the united states enters an election year. " for my final address to this chamber, i don't want to talk just about the next year. i want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond, " said obama, mindful of the fact that the 	 0
A federal jury on Wednesday awarded 14 . 1 million to five Indian guest workers who claimed they were defrauded and made to live in squalid conditions after being lured to work for an Alabama based marine and fabrication company following Hurricane Katrina .The jury issued its verdict against Mobile , Alabama based Signal International LLC and its associates in a civil trial overseen by U . S . District Judge Susie Morgan .More than 200 other workers ' claims are pending against the company , lawyers said . The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages .Indian H2B guest workers protest conditions at Signal International shipyard in 2008 : A federal jury on Wednesday awarded 14 . 1 million to five workers who claimed they were defrauded and made to live in squalid conditionsThe suit was filed in 2008 , charging that Signal used the federal government ' s H 2B guest worker program to recruit Indians to work as welders and pipefitters at its facilities in Pascagoula , Mississippi , and Orange , Texas .The suit alleged Signal falsely promised to help the workers apply for and receive green cards . But the plaintiffs claimed they were the victims of a labor trafficking scheme by Signal , an immigration lawyer and an Indian labor recruiter .Signal faces paying 12 million of the damages , plaintiffs lawyers said .' In short , these workers were sold a bill of goods , ' said Alan Howard , a lawyer for Southern Poverty Law Center , an Alabama civil rights group that represented the Indian workers .' They were victimized and exploited and really taken advantage of . 'The plaintiffs claim they were charged 10 , 000 per person by recruiters who gave them false promises that they would be able to get green cards and obtain permanent residency in the United States .The suit accused Signal of housing the workers in squalid conditions and forcing them to pay 1 , 050 each a month to stay in dirty trailersBased on those promises , the suit claims Indian workers went into debt to get the jobs for Signal and in some cases sold homes and gave up jobs in India before leaving for the Gulf Coast .Once they arrived , the guest workers claimed they were told they were going to get 10 month work permits . The suit also accused Signal of housing the workers in squalid conditions and forcing them to pay 1 , 050 each a month to stay in overcrowded and dirty trailers .Signal said in a statement that it ' strongly disagrees ' with Wednesday ' s verdict and is considering an appeal .Howard said the cases of about 230 other workers are pending against Signal . An attempt to certify the Indian workers under a class action suit was rejected by a federal judge .Signal hired about 500 workers to work at its facilities after Katrina . The company said it was facing a shortage of skilled workers following the 2005 hurricane and that it paid the Indian workers 18 an hour , the same as American workers would have received for the same jobs .Hurricane Katrina : Signal said it was facing a shortage of skilled workers following the 2005 hurricane and that it paid the Indian workers 18 an hour , the same as American workers would have received for the same jobsPlaintiffs ' lawyers contended that American workers , due to the shortage of skilled laborers , commanded much higher wages and that Signal profited greatly from the use of the Indian workers .The suits are being brought under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act , a federal law passed in 2003 to protect people from traffickers .The U . S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is also suing Signal . That trial is slated to start on June 1 in New Orleans .Howard said it was far from clear when the Indian workers might see any compensation . He said Signal has suggested it might file for bankruptcy .A spokeswoman for the company said she could not comment on that issue but would pass it to others for their consideration . 	 0
A one minute silence across the North East will be held tomorrow in observation of the loss of a family from Teesside who had to cut their Sky TV subscription due to austerity .As a result , Dan Matthews of Middlesbrough will no longer be able to follow his favourite team in the Premier League , his wife Mary will no longer be able to watch CSI and his son Richard will no longer be able to watch Game Of Thrones .We have been told that donations via PayPal and by collection bucket in the local church are being accepted .We contacted Mr Matthews for comment and he told us : " The loss we have suffered is almost immeasurable ." The lost programmes are so many that our typical week of viewing has now been ruined , this lunchtime it reached a low when I found myself forced to watch " Bargain Hunt " , it wasn ' t even interesting or entertaining , or even informative despite what the students from the local college say ." I have been reduced to logging on to torrent sites and begging for files . "Bargain Hunt is shown at the same time as when NCIS would normally be on Sky 1 .In light of the situation faced by the Matthews family , a petition has been launched to bring support to the many families across the UK who are suffering without a subscription to the award winning satellite television service .Mr Matthews continued : " The only channel we have remaining from Sky itself now is Pick , Pick ! imagine that , no human should have to suffer that sort of low budget TV on their screen , I need counselling already after I came across an episode of Most Haunted from SIX years ago !

OKLAHOMA CITY , OK On the surface , the newsroom of local NBC affiliate KFOR appears to be quite serious . But that doesn ' t mean the Live At Five news team doesn ' t know how to have some fun from time to time , as viewers learned Monday night .According to computer graphic designer Dan Janney , the news broadcast team nearly lost its composure Monday , when his irreverent weather map graphic went live during a segment by Channel 4 meteorologist Grant Johnson ." It ' s more my style to stay behind the scenes , " Janney said . " But every once in a while , I have to admit , it ' s fun to push the envelope . "Janney added : " I like to give the crew a good laugh . "In the graphic , which he designed for the five day extended forecast chart that concludes the weather segment , Janney replaced the network ' s " sun in sunshades " graphic with the head of veteran KFOR sports anchor Bob Barry Sr . wearing sunshades and surrounded by a halo of golden rays ." I had the idea , and I told my assistant Jennifer Sabin about it , and she thought it was hysterical , so we spent about 10 minutes putting it together on our lunch break , " Janney said . " To our good fortune , the weekend portion of the chart forecasted sunny weather , so the gag got high visibility . "Janney added : " It had the guys in the control room in stitches before air time . I begged newscast director Jim Underwood not to tell Grant about it , and thankfully he agreed . He knows how to play a joke . "Underwood , who has directed local KFOR programming for 18 years and produces the Sunday morning current events roundtable Think About It With Neil Clover , enthusiastically agreed to televise Janney ' s graphic , calling it " an amusing change of pace . " He even authorized camera operator Mike Bethke to capture the reaction of lead anchor Chuck Bartlett in a highly unusual cutaway from the forecast graphic ." The usual ' sun wearing the shades ' graphic is cute we still get letters about it from viewers , " Underwood said . " But replacing that sun with Bob Barry ? That was a hoot . "Underwood added : " Live At Five has a reputation for having an offbeat sense of humor , and that ' s a part of its appeal . "According to Janney , Johnston does not normally look at the monitor while introducing the extended forecast and was initially confused by the titters coming from the camera operators . When he saw the monitor , he broke into a wide grin , chuckled , and said , " And there ' s Bob Barry , KFOR ' s original golden boy . "" It was a wonderful ad lib , " Sabin said . " I ' ll bet most of the home audience thought he was in on the joke from the start . But he wasn ' t . He ' s that good . "Said Janney : " The killer part was when Grant threw to Chuck , and Chuck sang a couple of bars of ' You Are The Sunshine Of My Life . ' Practically everyone in the studio was dying . But Grant didn ' t miss a beat . He comes right back with , ' Aw , Chuck , I didn ' t know you cared . ' By that point , everybody on set was in stitches . "Janney has received positive feedback for his shenanigan , including e mails of praise from viewers . Yet , when asked about doing something similar in the future , Janney became coy ." If we did something silly every day , we ' d risk losing our edge , " he said . " But who knows when something like that will happen again . You ' ll just have to keep watching Live At Five to find out . " 	 1
San Diego Retired Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor , the first woman to sit on the U . S . Supreme Court after 191 years , is crusading to reverse what she says is an alarming decline in America ' s knowledge of democracy and announced an initiative Wednesday to educate children across the country .Asserting that democracy is not inherited at birth but rather learned in school , O ' Connor founded the educational nonprofit group iCivics in 2009 to secure America ' s governance and prepare the next generation of citizens and leaders .On Wednesday , O ' Connor announced an expansion of that program to include the Boys Girls Club of America , which has almost 4 , 000 clubs serving 4 . 1 million youngsters ." Many states around the country are no longer teaching or requiring civics education for young people , " said O ' Connor , 82 . " When I went to school and that was a long time ago , and I went to school in El Paso , Texas we had civics almost every year , and in fact , I almost got tired of it ." But the fact of the matter is that every young person needs to learn how our government works at the national level , at the state level , at the local level and how they can be part of it , " O ' Connor said .O ' Connor said her website , iCivics . org , was partnering with the Boys Girls Clubs because of its vast network serving youths ." It ' s a very big organization , and I want them to know and use and they want to know and to use iCivics because it ' s a great activity for young people , " O ' Connor added .O ' Connor cited an Annenberg Public Policy Center national survey showing that only one third of Americans could name all three branches of the U . S . government ." I can ' t believe it , " O ' Connor said in in a speech at the Boys Girls Clubs of America ' s national conference in San Diego on Wednesday .Then she added : " Two thirds of Americans can name a judge on ' American Idol , ' and only 15 can name the chief justice of the United States , " who is John Roberts ." Civic knowledge can ' t be handed down the gene pool . It has to be learned , " O ' Connor told the gathering of 2 , 400 conference attendees .O ' Connor said the American awareness of civics is " on the decline . "" It ' s putting our country at some risk , " O ' Connor said .iCivics offers free curricula and video games in public , private and charter schools in all 50 states and has counted more than 5 million game plays on its website , spokeswoman Kelly Landis said . The 16 video games are designed to teach students about civics , even asking them to play the role of president .O ' Connor was a President Reagan appointee to the Supreme Court in 1981 , and she retired from the nation ' s highest court in 2006 . 	 0
police officers in the nypd have hit back at outraged protesters furious at the death of eric garner, a black man who died in a police chokehold, saying he brought it upon himself. union officials and police supporters have seized on findings showing that garner's asthma and obesity contributed to his death, and say they feel'thrown under the bus'by demonstrations and politicians. they also said that more people should have been pointing out that garner was wrong to resist arrest when confronted by officers in state island, new york city, this july. killing : eric garner was killed by an nypd officer grabbing him round the neck. officers have pointed out that garner's size and health issues contributedhe was wrestled to the ground and repeatedly told officers'i can't breathe'as white patrolman daniel pantaleo held him round the neck. he died in the wake of the confrontation over the illegal sale of loose cigarettes but a grand jury this week decided there would be no indictment over this death. the verdict, following close behind the decision not to charge officer darren wilson for shooting dead michael brown in ferguson, missouri, prompted waves of ongoing protests which have left officers sore. mayor bill de blasio also weighed in, saying the case underscores the nypd's need to improve relations with minorities. policemen say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street.'police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,'said patrick lynch, president of the police union. outraged : police officers say they feel badly treated by widespread protests sparked by the casebut lynch said :'what we did not hear is this : you cannot go out and break the law. what we did not hear is that you cannot resist arrest. that's a crime.'at the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days, protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case. signs read :'nypd : blood on your hands,'' racism kills'and'hey officers, choke me or shoot me.'some demonstrators shouted,'nypd pigs!'more than 280 people have been arrested, and more demonstrations were planned friday. in private and on internet chat rooms, officers have said they feel demoralized, misunderstood and'all alone '. some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of garner's, in defiance of the nypd's campaign of cracking down on minor'quality of life'offenses as a way to discourage serious crime.'everyone is just demonizing the police,'said maki haberfeld, a professor of police studies at john jay college of criminal justice.'but police follow orders and laws. nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality of life enforcement is necessary.'marches : people have called for police reform on the back of the garner case. union bosses say the message should be not to resist arrestthe fatal encounter occurred in july after pantaleo and other police officers responded to complaints about garner, a heavyset 43 year old father of six. the video showed garner telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. pantaleo, an eight year veteran, appeared to wrap his arm around garner's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers. garner could be heard saying,'i can't breathe,'several times before he went motionless. the medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in garner's death, but also that asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors. while many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer, no evidence has come to light to suggest that pantaleo's actions were racially motivated. his supervising sergeant at the scene was black, and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation. as the video sparked accusations of excessive force, the police unions mounted a counter narrative : that garner would still be alive if he had obeyed orders, that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that pantaleo had used an authorized takedown move more like a headlock than a chokehold to subdue him. while the grand jury proceedings were secret, pantaleo's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke garner and did not believe the man was in mortal danger. pantaleo's defenders have included rep. peter king, r n. y., who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if garner had been white, and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he couldn't breathe.'the fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe,'said king, the son of a police officer. 	 0
More than 20 ponies have starved to death on Bodmin Moor , with at least two of the animals dying while giving birth because they were too weak from neglect .Eight of the ponies had to be shot by Government vets because they were too weak and emaciated to come down from the moor , according to a farmers and landlords group .One pregnant mare was due to be put down but foaled overnight . Mother and baby have now been taken in by South West Equine Protection along with two other ponies .Ponies apparently dumped on Bodmin Moor have starved to death due to neglectIt is not known who owned the animals and it appears they had been dumped on the moor and unable to withstand the conditions on the higher ground .Bodmin ponies are owned by farmers who have grazing rights on the land but they are bound by law to care for them and feed them during the winter .Julie Dowton , secretary of the commoners ' association , said : ' It is an appalling situation . We are absolutely distressed .' The whole Bodmin Moor farming community is absolutely appalled that it has happened and we now have to look at how we are going to clear it up .

Cool again ? A fashion model poses with an e cigarette , which have now been banned from a string of pubs , restaurants , coffee chains and hotelsE cigarette users face widespread bans on the devices in pubs , restaurants and coffee chains .Starbucks , Caffe Nero , All Bar One , Nicholson ' s pubs and KFC have joined public transport companies and airlines in banning the use of e cigarettes in their branches .It comes after a widely criticised World Health Organisation report this summer which bans on indoor use , advertising and sales to minors .Uptake of e cigarettes , which use battery powered cartridges to produce a nicotine laced vapour , has rocketed in the past two years , but there is fierce debate about their potential risks and benefits .Because they are new , there ' s little scientific evidence on their safety . Some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking , while others say they have potential to help millions of smokers kick the habit .But there ' s little patience for solid scientific findings . the National Portrait Gallery , the Tate Gallery , the Royal Opera House and the Natural History Museum have all banned e cigarettes , The Sunday Times reports .' The bans are shortsighted , ' said Michael Clapper , chairman of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association and co founder of e cigarette company Vapestick .' The vapour release from electronic cigarettes is not harmful to bystanders . . . This will alienate customers who use electronic cigarettes . 'While regular cigarettes release deadly carcinogens and toxins along with their nicotine payload , and kill more than 6million people a year , e cigarettes are said to be significantly less harmful .But in August the WHO , the United Nations health body , commissioned a review of e cigarettes calling for stiff regulation on their use similar to that applied to normal tobacco products .A group of tobacco addiction experts who critiqued the report said the WHO ' s findings were riddled with errors , misinterpretations and misrepresentations , meaning policymakers may miss their potential health benefits .Risks : Because e cigs are new , there ' s little scientific evidence on their safety . Some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking , while others say they have potential to help millions kick the habitAnn McNeill , a researcher at the national addiction centre at King ' s College London , said : ' I was shocked and surprised when I read it . I felt it was an inaccurate portrayal of the evidence on e cigarettes . 'McNeill said that while e cigarettes are relatively new and ' we certainly don ' t yet have all the answers as to their long term health impact ' , it is clear they are far safer than cigarettes .Her co author Peter Hajek of the tobacco dependence research unit at Queen Mary , University of London , said it was vital that e cigarettes should be assessed in relation to the known harms of tobacco cigarettes .' There are currently two products competing for smokers ' custom , ' he said . ' One the conventional cigarette endangers users and bystanders and recruits new customers from among non smoking children who try it .' The other the e cigarette is orders of magnitude safer , poses no risk to bystanders , and generates negligible rates of regular use among non smoking children who try it . 'But the British Medical Association said it supported bans , in line with its no smoking policy .Sheila Hollins , chairman of the BMA ' s board of science , told The Sunday Times : ' Stronger controls are needed on where e cigarettes can be used to protect others from exposure , to ensure their use does not undermine existing restrictions on smoke free public places . . . and to guarantee the use of e cigarettes does not reinforce the normalcy of smoking behaviour .

Freshman Sen . Marco Rubio of Florida , who is in third place at 11 percent , has gotten into big trouble running up large debts on his credit cards , which he says he has paid .Mr Rubio is tied with freshman Sen . Ted Cruz of Texas who is in his third year in office , campaigning for the presidency as soon as he was elected in 2012 .Everyone else in the Republican field is in the low single digits or registers no numbers at all .As front runner , Mr Trump is coming under severe political criticism for many of his positions ? particularly from the conservative Club for Growth that focuses on economic issues .Donald Trump is a great entertainer and developer , but his ideas of what to do as president won t grow the economy , says the group s president , David McIntosh .He is not a serious Republican candidate , and many of his positions make him better suited to take on Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary , says Mr McIntosh .Here are some of the positions the Club says Mr Trump has taken in the past on major issues :Mr Trump on health care : We must have universal healthcare , he said in his book . I m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one .In an interview earlier this year , Mr Trump continued to applaud single payer health care systems used in other countries , the Club said .Mr Trump on Taxes : I would impose a one time , 14 . 25 percent tax on individuals and trusts with a net worth over 10 million , he said . But raising taxes on the wealthy reduces business capital investment , resulting in weaker economic growth and tax revenue needed to pay down the government s mushrooming debts .Mr Trump on Trade : He has called for a 20 percent tax for importing goods , and a Twenty five percent tax on China , unless they behave .This of course would trigger a trade war with America s trading partners , from Canada to Europe to the Far East , ? hurting U . S . businesses and consumers . Not unlike the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act that led to the Great Depression .Mr Trump on Eminent Domain : When asked about the 2005 U . S . Supreme Court case Kelo vs . City of New London , that allowed economic development to be a legitimate reason for government to exercise eminent domain , Mr Trump told Fox News : I happen to agree with it 100 percent .Trump has held anti growth positions on each of those issues and still defends a massive government role in health care , Mr McIntosh says . Trump would not be a pro growth president .Meantime , Republicans are reported to be feuding over whether to seek sweeping entitlement reforms next year , including Medicare and Social Security ? long considered the deadly Third Rail in American politics .Earlier this week , House Speaker Paul Ryan said he intends to undertake a bold alternative agenda that will included entitlements . 	 0
warren, pa although respondents to a pew poll taken prior to the 2004 presidential election characterized bush as " the candidate they'd most like to sit down and have a beer with, " chris reinard lived the hypothetical scenario sunday afternoon, and characterized it as " really uncomfortable and awkward. " reinard, a father of four who supported bush in the 2000 and 2004 elections, said sharing a beer with the president at the switchyard tap gave him " an uneasy feeling. " " i thought he'd be great, " reinard said. " but when i actually met him, i felt real put off. " the president arrived at the bar via motorcade close to 3 p. m. after a sweep by secret service agents, reinard was asked, for security reasons, to move from his favorite stool. shortly after he had reseated himself, reinard said he " was pleased " to welcome the president to the switchyard. " boy, it sure is a good day for a cool one, " bush reportedly told the assembled patrons, who were watching the dolphins patriots game. " when he first walked in, everything seemed fine, " bartender bob kern said. " he told everyone'hi'like he was one of the regulars, then sat next to chris. " reinard ordered two budweisers, but bush interrupted him, saying he'd prefer an o'doul's non alcoholic beer. " i completely forgot he stopped drinking, " reinard said. following the initial gaffe, bush attempted to smooth things over, asking reinard to call him " george. " reinard complied, but later said " it felt a little unnatural. " " i guess i was supposed to tell him to call me chris, " reinard said. " i didn't like him calling me'mr reinard'the whole time, but i didn't know if it was okay to interrupt him to say'call me chris.'and then also, it felt weird to just say it out of nowhere. like,'call me chris.'" bush asked reinard if he had any hobbies, and reinard told the president that he enjoys spending weekends with his children on local lakes in his small aluminum boat. " mr bush, i mean george, seemed to like that, and i felt that we finally made a connection, " reinard said. " but then he started telling me about this one time he was on a yacht with some arab prince and they spent four hours landing a sailfish. " " it was a good story, but i just like catching a few bass with my kids is all, " reinard added. " i know he didn't mean to make me feel bad, but still. " reinard told the president that he has lived most of his life in the warren area, except for several years he spent in nearby jamestown, where he attended community college for a year. bush told reinard he was born in new haven, ct, and grew up in texas before attending yale university as an undergraduate and earning his mba from harvard, all while maintaining membership in many exclusive clubs. " i asked george how much it costs to be in those social clubs, but he said he didn't remember, " reinard said. " i think he just didn't want to say the amount. he'd change the subject on me a lot, say he did a lot of partying back then, but that was all behind him now, since he found the lord, or whatever. " bush asked reinard what he did for a living, and reinard said he runs a small carpentry business. " he asked me how it was going, what with the economy bouncing back. i said that if things didn't pick up soon, i was going to have to close up shop and work for my uncle in youngstown, " reinard said. " george was quiet for a while after that. then he told me about when his second oil company was going under. he suggested using my connections to get some outside investment capital. " " i don't have any connections, " reinard added. when the conversation reached a dead end, reinard and bush were silent once again, their eyes tracking the game. " we were sitting there watching the game, and some cheerleaders were up there waving their pompoms, " reinard said. " then george mentioned that he used to be a cheerleader at yale. i didn't know what to say to that one, so i just drank the rest of my beer real fast. " after nearly a minute of silence, bush drained the remainder of his o'doul's and wished reinard goodbye, saying that he'd stay longer if he could, but had " some business to tend to.

They thought this was all over " after the disappearance of Milly Dowler in 2002 and the conviction of a man for her murder this year , lawyer Mark Lewis said .But in April , police told the Dowlers that journalists had hacked into their phones and those of their daughter , he said .The accusation is the latest twist in a long running scandal involving media baron Rupert Murdoch ' s flagship Sunday British tabloid newspaper , the News of the World .The paper has apologized for hacking into the voicemails of celebrities and politicians , paying compensation to actress Sienna Miller and offering money to others .But the Dowler case is the first time the newspaper is accused of interfering with a police investigation .British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday called the allegations " quite shocking " and urged the police to investigate thoroughly .A former top tabloid journalist Tuesday called the allegations a significant change in the course of the scandal ." Before we had hacking of celebrities and politicians , but here we have the interference of a murder inquiry involving a 13 year old girl , " said Roy Greenslade , a former editor of the Daily Mirror and an assistant editor of the Sun , a sister paper of News of The World ." Outside of the political elite in Britain , this story has had little traction until now . The allegations about the hacking of Milly Dowler ' s phone has the potential to change that , " Greenslade said .Police Monday declined to say whether Milly Dowler was among the victims of phone hacking .Meanwhile a private investigator working for News of the World who was jailed over another phone hacking case , in 2007 , issued a statement to the UK ' s Guardian newspaper apologizing for the " hurt " caused by his actions .Glenn Mulcaire did not mention hacking Milly Dowler ' s phone but said he had never intended to interfere in any police inquiry .He said he had faced " relentless pressure " for results at the paper , and that while he knew they were pushing ethical boundaries , he had not understood they were breaking the law .One of the top company officials told staff later that it was " almost too horrific to believe that a professional journalist or even a freelance inquiry agent working on behalf of a member of the News of the World staff could behave in this way . "Rebekah Brooks , who was editor of the paper at the time of the alleged hacking and is now chief executive of News International , told staff she was " sickened that these events are alleged to have happened . "She said she had contacted the Dowlers on Tuesday " to assure them News International will vigorously pursue the truth and that they will be the first to be informed of the outcome of our investigation . "Brooks asked Lewis , the Dowler lawyer , to show the company any evidence it had " so we can swiftly take the appropriate action . "She said News International was cooperating with police investigations .Brooks acknowledges in the message that there is speculation she might resign , but said she was " determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues . "The tumult may have an impact on the newspaper ' s advertising revenues .Ford Britain said it was withdrawing its advertising from News of the World until there was an outcome from its investigation ." Ford is a company which cares about standards of behaviour of its own people and those it deals with externally , " the carmaker said in a statement .A spokesman for T Mobile said the firm was reviewing its advertising position with the News of the World , while supermarket chain Tesco said the latest allegations would " cause huge distress to a family which has suffered enough " and said it was awaiting the result of the police inquiry .At least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation , Operation Weeting , was launched in January .Mulcaire and a journalist working for the News of the World were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voicemails of royal staff in an earlier investigation .Police launched the new investigation this year in response to widespread complaints from politicians , celebrities and other high profile figures who fear they have been targets .News International has apologized for unspecified cases of phone hacking . They say they have been cooperating with police since the new investigation was launched in January .The Sunday tabloid newspaper in April offered compensation and " apologized unreservedly " for the " unacceptable " hacking . It did not name the victims .News International owns the News of the World , plus the Sun , the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain .Murdoch ' s media empire also encompasses Fox News , the Wall Street Journal , the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers . 	 0
Santa Ana , California Arrested on federal charges for having a handgun and bullets in her third grade classroom in early April , the teacher entered a not guilty plea in a Santa Ana courtroom today . Through her attorney , she insisted she never intended to harm her pupils with the handgun she kept in a supply closet in her classroom but merely intended to use the pistol as a visual instructional aide , giving her students a learning incentive they well deserve ." She was always a firm believer in visual instructional aides , " said a fellow teacher at the Diamond elementary school in Santa Ana , where she taught at before her arrest . " Although , personally , I would have stuck to sock puppets , but hey , that ' s just me . "None of the third graders could be reached for comment because of their age however , parents of former students did go on the record in her defense ." Her teaching methods are unorthodox to say the least and possibly a federal crime , too , but she knows how to grab the kids ' attention and keep it , " said Maggie Faulkner , who had her son in the class last year . " I use to have a hell of a time getting my son to read , do his math or even stop picking his nose . But after I enrolled him in her class , I don ' t have to ask him twice to do anything . Now if I could only get him to stop wetting himself whenever he hears a loud noise . I ' ll talk to her after her trial . I bet she can help me with that too . "Reportedly , the discovery of the handgun and bullets in the classroom came when she started yelling and screaming at the children , up set that they still had difficulty spelling her name on the practice test forms ." I heard all the kids crying , as usual , " said Mark Sanchez , the school custodian . " But I got worried when all the crying suddenly stopped . "Sanchez then peered into the classroom window and was shocked to see the teacher wildly waving a pistol in the air threatening to use it on the first kid who dare misspell her name ." I always wondered why I was having to clean up after so many kids that messed themselves in her class , " said Sanchez . " Too bad too , I heard her students always made honor roll . "Her defense attorney and experts in the field of elementary school education agree teachers are under extreme pressure to bring up their students ' grades and test scores , especially in times of a school budget crisis ." With statewide testing coming up , I ' m surprised more teachers haven ' t been arrested on federal firearms possession charges , " said the attorney . 	 1
it was the kind of phone call military families dread receiving from iraq and afghanistan not from texas. peggy mccarty's daughter called thursday afternoon to say she had been wounded by a gunshot in her left shoulder. keara bono, 21, assured her mother that she was ok, but mccarty's heart skipped. she knew she had much to fear when bono, an army specialist, arrived at fort hood to prepare for an early december deployment to iraq. but mccarty never thought she would have to worry about her child getting wounded on american soil. bono was one of 30 people hurt when a soldier opened fire on a military processing center at fort hood, the place where soldiers report before they head to war. they get medical and dental checkups there. they settle finances and even make out their wills. thursday, the center turned into a killing field, and 13 lives were abruptly cut short. america watched in horror the news of the shootings, the deadliest ever on a military base. some of the victims, such as bono, were preparing to head to iraq or afghanistan. they were felled instead in the place they called home. when the shouts of " shots fired! shots fired! " started, one soldier pushed and shoved people to get out the back of the readiness center. and run. the soldier, who did not want to be identified, heard more screaming. soldiers were dragging bodies away from the shooter. they snatched tablecloths off tables, cut up their own sage green digital combat uniforms, even their tan undershirts, and turned them into tourniquets and pressure bandages. everyone tried to render cpr and medical aid. some were medical personnel. others were simply friends helping friends. they were soldiers, after all, and trained as combat lifesavers, though they could not have imagined having to use their skills at home. but soldiers never abandon wounded comrades on the battlefield. most of the injured were awake and alert, witnesses recalled. they just weren't talking. about a mile away at darnall army medical center, army medic spc. eric blohm waited for mass casualties. if the emergency rooms filled up, darnall would put victims in rooms where usually babies are brought into the world. it felt too much like blohm's tour of iraq. watch blohm describe the scenethe shooting suspect, maj. nidal malik hasan, was a psychiatrist who had an office at darnall. now, the hospital was taking in the doctor's alleged victims. sirens, installed after the september 11, 2001, attacks, sound routinely at fort hood during emergency drills. pam stephenson, the wife of a judge advocate general officer, was used to the blaring noise. early afternoon, she was about to make a quick trip to the grocery with megan, her 5 year old who stayed at home sick on thursday. but then she heard the whirring of choppers overhead and warnings on the loudspeakers : " take cover. stay away from windows. lock your doors. " her husband called and told her not to leave the house. she turned on the television and learned the grim news. the gunman, she discovered, was a soldier. " when you hear it's soldiers gone crazy you don't know what kind of ammunition or guns they have, " she said. she wanted to fetch patrick, 2, stuck at day care, but the sprawling post was under lockdown. no one knew then if there were killers on the loose. the streets were deserted. a mass of cars, waiting to get out, piled up at the gates. loved ones waited on the other side, desperate for news of their soldiers. stephenson checked facebook and read a message from a military friend serving overseas. deployed soldiers from fort hood were in a panic not knowing whether their families were safe. she checked on the soldier's wife and worried about patrick. finally, at 7 : 15, she was able to see her baby. many miles away in punta gorda, florida, roxanne johnson was chitchatting with her son, justin, on the phone. he was a young track vehicle mechanic who was heading to afghanistan come january. mother and son joked and laughed, like they always did. and then she heard a strange noise : " dosh, dosh, dosh. " what was that? she wondered. she pressed the phone to her ear and listened. she heard the screams and the crying. wow, she thought. it sounds so real. her son's voice was gone. she refused to hang up until she could hear justin again. she heard people shuffling about and muffled voices. where was justin? had he been hurt? what was going on? " justin, call home! " she said aloud. hours passed before johnson learned the fate of her son. he was one of the shooting victims. but justin johnson was one of the lucky ones. 	 0
Tiger Woods will have to raise his game to a higher level than ever before to beat Rory McIlroy , according to Colin Montgomerie .Woods has been a shadow of the golfer he once was following serious back injuries this year and finished last in his most recent comeback following major surgery .

But Montgomerie warned his former rival that McIlroy is now playing golf that surpasses anything he has ever achieved .' Tiger Woods is going to come back into the frame , ' Mongomerie told Kicca . com when discussing next year ' s Masters . ' Is he going to be able to get back , not just to the levels he was but better than that ? Because that ' s where Rory McIlroy ' s taken the standard of golf : to one level beyond where Tiger was .

Montgomerie duelled with Woods for The Open at St Andrews in 2005 but was beaten into second place .Montgomerie also looked even further ahead , tipping McIlroy to claim a second US Open at Chambers Bay in June and thus a career Grand Slam of majors .McIlroy will bid for a career Grand Slam at the Masters , where he suffered a meltdown in 2011Woods once captured four majors in succession , from the US Open in 2000 to the Masters in 2001The Ryder Cup legend was even prepared to speculate that McIlroy could go on to win all four majors in 2015 , which would be six in a row , an unprecedented feat in the sport .' If he does win the Masters that US Open will be a big , big , big do indeed , ' said Montgomerie .' Can he win all four in a year ? That ' s another question on people ' s lips within our game . Can he win all four in a year , never mind two ? That means six in a row . Wow , that ' ll be something .' If you ' re a betting man I ' m sure there ' s a lot of people putting money on it I ' m sure it ' s a 100 1 shot but it ' s worth a punt . 'Colin Montgomerie has been in action in Mauritius this week on the European Senior TourThe odds of McIlroy winning all four majors in 2015 are currently 80 1 with many bookmakers .Montgomerie added : ' If I was a gambler , which I ' m not , I ' d put money on that he ' s that dominant , and that good .

tyson fury : i m the first irish heavyweight champion of the worldimmediately after the unanimous points win that saw him become the genuine heavyweight champion of the world, tyson fury credited his promoter and manager mick hennessy as being the jerry maguire of boxing. it may have seemed a sentimental comment, but fury s victory over wladimir klitscho at the 55, 000 capacity esprit arena largely appeared to be built on a team effort. the fingerprints of his uncle and trainer peter fury were obvious to see in the new champion s performance, which was disciplined throughout and against all the antics he had produced in the build up, but hennessy played a key role in bringing the 27 year old challenger towards his title tilt in dusseldorf. promoter hennessy claimed he was left in no man s land after his tv deal with uk broadcaster itv collapsed? a disaster for him which happened prior to fury becoming a name on the world stage? and he was full of praise for his fighter after victory which saw the pair turn full circle as fury claimed the most prestigious prize in boxing. read next darren o neill closes on sixth elite crownit s been a long, hard road and i ve had a lot of disappointment and a lot of people who i thought were genuine who turned out to be disgraceful with their behaviour, said hennessy. to have someone like tyson, when the craic went sour he put his arm around me and said you believed in me when i needed it, and whatever it takes and whatever rollercoaster we get on, i ll be on it with you and if it means me fighting for nothing i ll do it. hennessy s future as a big time promoter was questioned after his split with his former fighter carl froch, but he was visibly delighted to see his heavyweight star finally climb to the mantle of heavyweight champion of the world. i d go through brick walls for this kid, said hennessy. anyone who shows me they re a proper human being, a loyal human being, that s what i am. i m a loyal person and if i m with you i m with you a hundred per cent. i won t let anything go wrong with this kid. hennessy was also quick to defend fury over an apparently disputed choice of anthem heading into the bout with klitschko. god save the queen was played for the challenger s introduction, while a union jack was paraded in his corner. hennessy ( who is also of irish heritage ) claimed that the fury camp wanted a neutral anthem to be played in recognition of his irish family links but said the promoters failed to follow their requests. they weren t supposed to play a national anthem because he considers himself british and irish, they were supposed to play we are the world but they played one national anthem. he s born in england but he s of irish heritage, said hennessy. although fury can often be paradoxical or contradictory in many statements, he does appear to place some value on his irish heritage, with the newly crowned world champion proclaiming himself as the first irish heavyweight champion of the world after his dominant points win over klitschko? a claim that could be disputed on many levels considering other heavyweight champions with similar irish links? but the manchester born fighter was keen to make a point of his background at the post fight press conference. everything is destined to be in life, every turn we take is planned, said a humble fury after his win, abandoning the vocal approach he had adopted in the build up. from the first moment i laced on a pair of boxing gloves, there wasn t one person in my family who didn t believe i wasn t going to be the heavyweight champion of the world, added the new champion, a proud traveller, who recalled his first sparring sessions with his brother se n in the childhood kitchen. from the beginning i aimed for the stars and anything less was a failure. tonight i hit a shooting star. and i m the first irish heavyweight champion of the world, added fury. the defending champion was clearly disappointed but seemed eager to exert a right to a rematch clause in the fight contract. i couldn t find the right distance to win this fight, said klitschko, whose efforts were comprehensively nullified by fury. tyson was quick with his body shots and his head movement, continued klitschko, who added : this is to be continued. the defeated champion was adamant that he will look to fight fury again, but neither promotional team from either side was willing to suggest a venue for a rematch. we ll look at how quickly the rematch can be done, i can t go into details but it will be done in a certain period, said hennessy. as long as we re happy, the rematch will happen. we want the rematch because it s the biggest fight out there for him. we wanted a rematch clause because what other fight is out there? it s the biggest fight out there, we want to 	 0

Thousands of people who fled Syria ' s ' capital of the revolution ' two years ago returned today to see the apocalyptic destruction wreaked on their city .Snapping photographs on their phones , the displaced first began wandering nervously down paths carved from rubble yesterday in the old quarters of Homs , where thousands died in the ultimately failed battle by rebels against the troops of President Bashar al Assad .The scene that greeted them was devastating . Whole city blocks had been pounded into an endless scene of hollowed out buildings , covered in dust . The streets were littered with shattered concrete bricks , toppled telephone poles and charred , crumpled skeletons of cars .Apocalyptic : Many of the people who began streaming into the old quarters of Homs yesterday had not seen their homes for two years . They were greeted by a post apocalyptic landscape of burnt out buildings and charred cars , and had to traverse paths through the rubble which government forces had cleared hours earlierThen and now : This image taken before the conflict shows how the same street in Homs used to look , until it was ravaged by three years of civil warDevastation : Smoke rises from al Hamdeya neighbourhood in Homs yesterday . The area saw some of the fiercest fighting between rebels and forces of President AssadReturning home : Some were lucky to find possessions still intact after two years , but many were not . Whole tower blocks were reduced to dust and twisted metalSteady stream : Former residents filmed the blacked out buildings on their camera phones as they returned to claim their possessions and begin rebuilding the cityReturn to normal : Some squares looked remarkably untouched and thousands of people continued today to flood back into abandoned neighbourhoodsMore than 150 , 000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad ' s regime began in March 2011 , and Homs was the centre of much of the fighting , known by many as the ' capital of the revolution ' .Once a thriving city of more than a million people , President Bashar Assad ' s troops blockaded the neighborhoods of Homs for more than a year , pounding rebel bastions with his artillery and air force .Finally , under a deal struck this week , the rebels surrendered in a major victory for the government .The regime assumed control of the old quarters , while in return some 2 , 000 rebel fighters were granted safe passage to opposition areas north of Homs .The final piece of the agreement fell into place yesterday afternoon as the last 300 or so rebels left Homs , and an aid convoy was allowed into two pro government villages in northern Syria which had been besieged by the opposition .The seizure of Homs is not only symbolic the city is also a tactical and logistical linchpin which the government can use to launch further offensives on rebel held territory in the north .Lawless : The Syrian Civil War began as an uprising more than three years ago , as rebels took to the streets to protest against five decades of rule by the Ba ' ath partyTension : Although the peace deal was a major victory for the Syrian government , troops were still patrolling the streets and escorting residents in and out of the areaA path through the wreckage : Once a thriving city of more than a million people , Homs will now be a linchpin from which Assad ' s forces can launch further offensives 	 0
Jed Simpson , Britain ' s leading rower heading for the London 2012 Paralympics , has had his bid for gold put in jeopardy .The Sunderland born sportsman has contracted woodworm in his left leg .Simpson had noticed sawdust appearing in his bed over the past few weeks , but assumed he must have just been grinding his legs in his sleep . However , a hairline crack appeared last Tuesday , a result of the internal weakening of the structure caused by the parasitic larvae .The wood boring beetle has caused havoc in cupboards and dining room furniture for centuries , but this is the first known case of human infection .Simpson was rushed to a local carpenters for emergency preservation treatment , and head cabinet maker Brian Lough told us " Jed is in a stable condition , he ' s comfortable . But he ' s not out of the wood yet . "" We have treated his leg with creosote , but unfortunately due to British regulations it is a water based product , not the full strength product like we used to get . For that he would need to go abroad , and that has it ' s own moral implications . "Simpson lost his leg at the knee in 1983 , at the age of 11 , whilst playing with agricultural machinery . He had a wooden appendage fitted shortly after and took up rowing for his school , at which he excelled .Scoring several awards and a gold at the European championships , he was selected as head of the Paralymic team three years ago .His wooden leg was crafted by designer Thannett Henderson , chainsaw sculpter to the stars , and is said to be worth over 3000 . It had a sock distinctively carved on to it . Henderson is said to be in consultation throughout the preservation process .This set back has placed doubt on Simpson ' s fitness for next years event . Although pundits wooden rule him out completely .Updates as they come . 	 1

WASHINGTON ? ? Depending on which survey ? you read on Monday , businessman Donald Trump either is increasing his lead for the Republican presidential nomination in the first caucus state of Iowa or has fallen behind Texas Sen . Ted Cruz .A ? CNN ORC International poll ? had Trump with 33 percent support among likely Republican caucus goers . Cruz was second with 20 percent and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson third with 16 percent . Florida Sen . Marco Rubio was fourth with 11 percent . ?Cruz , on the other hand , led a ? Monmouth University survey of likely GOP caucus goers ? with ? 24 percent , followed by Trump with 19 percent , Rubio with ? 17 percent and Carson with 13 percent .The director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute , Patrick Murray , said the two surveys used different methods for determining who was likely to show up at the Republican caucuses next February .Murray said his model projected ? a record turnout , albeit much fewer caucus goers than CNN expected . The bigger the turnout , the better for Trump , he said ." The higher it goes , the better Trump ? does , " Murray said . " That ' s what it really boils down to . "The CNN survey of 552 likely Iowa GOP caucus goers was conducted Nov . 28 Dec . 6 and had a margin of error of 4 percentage points . The ? Monmouth poll of 425 likely Iowa Republican caucus goers was conducted Dec . 3 6 and had a margin of error of ? 4 . 8 percentage points .Cruz ' s support in both polls is significant higher than it was earlier , whether he is in first or second place .Cruz was in fourth place with 11 percent in a CNN poll released last ? month , and at 10 percent and tied for third place with Rubio in an October Monmouth poll . ?A ? member of the ? Senate Armed Services Committee , Cruz was just behind ? Trump in the CNN poll , 30 percent to 21 percent , on which candidate was best able to handle foreign policy .He trailed Trump by just 3 percentage points , 25 percent to 22 percent , in the CNN poll on the question of which candidate best represented the values of Republicans like yourself .Cruz first moved into second place in Iowa in a Quinnipiac University poll , trailing Trump , 25 percent to ? 23 ? percent .In the CNN poll , 52 percent said Trump was the candidate best able to handle the economy and 49 percent said immigration . He was judged the candidate best able to win the general election by 42 percent to 17 percent over Cruz and ? most effective at solving the country ' s problems by 36 percent to 17 percent over Cruz .In terms of handling the Islamic State , also known as ISIS , Trump led , 41 percent to 18 percent over his closest competitor , Cruz .4 . Carson ' s 15 minutes of fame may be over .Carson led ? Trump in Iowa in three October surveys . ? One of them was an October Monmouth poll where he led Trump , ? 32 percent ? to 18 percent . A CNN poll released last month gave ? Carson 23 percent in Iowa , just two points behind front runner Trump ' s 25 percent . ?Since then , as foreign policy and terrorism became more important to ? Republican voters , Carson ' s support diminished .A sign of his troubles came at last Thursday ' s Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum , when he mispronounced the name of the Palestinian group , Hamas , which is sworn to Israel ' s destruction and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U . S .In the Quinnipiac poll of likely Iowa caucus goers , Carson led with 28 percent in October and fell to third place and 18 percent in November .Despite some prominent endorsements and some campaign appearances , Gov . Chris Christie ? remains far behind in Iowa , making the first primary state of New Hampshire that much more important . He polled 2 ? percent in the CNN survey , statistically unchanged from the 3 percent he had last month , and was at 2 ? percent in the Monmouth poll , again statistically unchanged from 1 percent in October .But when ? asked which candidate best represented Democrats like themselves , Clinton held just a 46 percent to 44 percent lead over Sanders .That poll of 442 likely Democratic caucus goers had a margin of error of 4 . 5 percentage points . 	 0
With thousands of desperate migrants attempting to enter the UK through the channel tunnel , UKIP have come up with a number of ideas designed to make the problem go away .In a press conference this morning , UKIP ' s immigration spokesman , Ozzy Mosley , revealed their new policies on border security .After goose stepping his way into the room , he told assembled journalists , some of whom are actually literate , " Unfortunately , as much as we ' d like to we can ' t cull foreigners , something to do with the Human Rights Act prevents us from doing that . We can ' t shoot them on sight either . Well , since we can ' t use traps anymore to catch pests like foxes , badgers and liberals how about we use them on these pesky immigrants ? Set them up just outside our entrance to the Chunnel . Job done . "Open mouthed journalists pressed Mr Mosley on what he ' d do with those who managed to avoid the " migrant traps . "He elaborated , " Well , we ' d position automatic taser guns just beyond the traps . They ' d be programmed to go off whenever someone with brown skin goes past , or people who look a bit foreign . "Mr Mosley went on , " Any who get past these deterrents will be rounded up by men in black shirts , put in giant catapults on the beautifully white cliffs of Dover before being fired back to the continent while ' Rule Britannia ' plays in the background . "After the press conference had ended , Mr Mosley , not realising he was still mic ' d up , wandered off while chatting to a colleague , " I wish we could just shut the channel tunnel . Make the buggers swim here , or set sail in rickety old fishing boats . Most of them would drown before they got here . We can ' t propose that though . Bloody do gooders would have a field day . Honestly , what ' s this country become ? "Meanwhile , a Labour party spokeswoman told us , " These proposals are ludicrous . The channel tunnel was supposed to be a tunnel of love between the UK and mainland Europe . It would seem that UKIP would prefer it to be a tunnel of blood . Unbelievable . "Furthermore , US presidential candidate Donald Trump , who ' s in Scotland to watch the Women ' s Open at his Turnberry resort , claims he will be suing UKIP for stealing his border security ideas . 	 1
Nick Herbert led drive to keep Britain from adopting euroCameron will seek concession for emergency brake ' on migrantsU . K . lawmaker Nick Herbert will lead the Conservative Party s group campaigning for Britain to remain in the European Union as the premier continues negotiations on the terms of membership .Prime Minister David Cameron will meet EU leaders on Feb . 19 in Brussels , and is seeking concessions such as an emergency brake on migration to Britain , the Sunday Times reported . He has yet to state his position or call a date for a vote , though his cabinet has startedWe want reform in the European Union , and provided that there is significant reform , we d be willing to say yes to the choice to stay in , " Herbert said in a television interview on Sky News Sunday . I don t think we re unconditional supporters . "The share of Britons who say the U . K . should leave the bloc rose 6 percentage points from May to 53 percent , against 47 percent who prefer to stay , according to a Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday . That result excludes undecided voters , and when these are included 42 percent will vote to leave , 38 percent to stay , while 20 percent are undecided .Sunday Telegraph , Herbert said the U . K . can achieve a favorable position " for itself relative to the bloc , and must be cautious on the risks of leaving . He led the campaign against the U . K . switching to the euro from the pound fifteen years ago .Leaving without the first idea of what we might get instead would be to jump into a void , he said . If reforms are secured , Britain would have the best of both worlds . We would be outside the euro , and protected from deeper integration , but able to access the single market .Cameron pledged a vote on EU membership as part of his general election campaign last year , and could call the referendum as soon as June . He s allowed his top team the freedom to vote against him and Chris Grayling , leader of the U . K . House of Commons , has already suggested he ll oppose continued membership .The campaign to keep the country in the EU , Britain Stronger in Europe , will send millions of households a four page leaflet on the benefits of membership . It will feature Karren Brady , who has appeared on The Apprentice TV show , who will say that U . K . companies " can create more jobs in Europe than out on their own . "Cameron will also be seeking a clarification of Britain s status in an outer circle of a two tier Europe and to change U . K . law to make its courts independent of Europe s Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Sunday Times reported , citing unnamed party members and ministers . 	 0
griffey, piazza elected to hall of fame : 13 things to knowon wednesday, the bbwaa announced that ken griffey jr. and mike piazza had been elected to the baseball hall of fame for 2016. here are some key takeaways from this year's balloting... 1. ken griffey set a new ballot percentage record. all but three voters named ken griffey jr. on their ballots, which comes to a percentage of 99. 3. that's an all time record. griffey's lofty tally breaks tom seaver's old record of 98. 8 percent. griffey also becomes just the 14th hall of famer ever to be named on at least 95 percent of ballots. 2. mike piazza is the rare catcher to the make the hall. piazza now becomes just the 17th primary catcher to make the hall of fame. among position players, only third basemen, with 14 inductees, number fewer in the hall. he'll become the first primary catcher to be inducted since gary carter in 2003. piazza actually garnered 19 fewer votes in 2016 than he did in 2015, yet his percentage increased from 69. 9 to 83. 0. in a related matter, the bbwaa prior to this year's balloting purged from the rolls more than 100 inactive voters who hadn't covered the game in a decade or more. the obvious conclusion is that the purged demographic in question wasn't particularly warm to piazza's case. in contrast, the more active members saw him, generally speaking, as the obvious hall of famer that he is. 4. griffey is the first no. 1 overall draft pick to make the hall. the draft has been around since 1965 and has yielded a total of 32 hall of famers. however, griffey ( mariners, 1987 ) is the first no. 1 overall pick to make the hall of fame. previously, reggie jackson ( no. 2 overall pick, 1966 ) had been the highest draftee to make it. soon enough, chipper jones ( no. 1 overall, 1990 ) will join griffey in this most exclusive club. 5. piazza is the lowest draft pick to make the hall. famously, piazza in 1988 wasn't drafted until the 62nd round. he was the 1, 390th pick of that draft, and the only reason the dodgers took him is tommy lasorda was close friends with piazza's father. that easily makes piazza the lowest ever draft pick to make the hall of fame. previously, the record belonged to 22nd rounder john smoltz ( tigers, no. 574 overall ) in 1985. ken griffey jr. and mike piazza are headed to cooperstown. ( usatsi ) 6. jeff bagwell will probably make it in 2017. this year, bagwell wound up just 15 votes shy of election. however, he leapt forward from 55. 7 percent support in 2015 to 71. 6 percent this year. obviously, this positions him to reach the necessary 75 percent in 2017, which will be his seventh year on the bbwaa ballot. 7. tim raines is close to election, but 2017 will be his final year on the ballot. in his ninth year on the ballot, tim raines one of the greatest leadoff hitters of all time and an obvious hall of famer in a more sensible universe jumped to 69. 8 percent in 2016. that's a positive step forward, and election is certainly with raines'grasp in 2016. however, 2016 will be his 10th year on the ballot, and the hall of fame not so long ago lowered the maximum time on the ballot from 15 years to 10 years. raines wasn't grandfathered in, so this will be his last shot. here's hoping he gets there. 8. curt schilling and mike mussina built good momentum. schilling and mussina, two decorated right handers who thrived in the heart of the high offense era of not so long ago, obviously didn't make it, but they're heading in the right direction. schilling in his fourth year on the ballot jumped from 39. 2 percent in 2015 to 52. 3 percent. that's an important step forward, as getting past the 50 percent mark typically bodes well for a candidate. in mussina's case, he went from 24. 6 percent in 2015 to 43. 0 percent in this, his third year on the ballot. he's not at schilling's level of support yet, but has more time and is trending properly. 9. trevor hoffman had a strong ballot debut. hoffman and his 601 saves didn't get the hall call this year, but the famed closer clocked in with a strong ballot percentage of 67. 3. when you register in the 	 0
Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season even though he may not be around to parade them .The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick start their faltering promotion bid .So far , everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi final play off slot .Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season , though he may not be at RangersBut with 12 players out of contract , McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season if they go up and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals .He said : ' I ' ve been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when . . . Even if I ' m not here , if I ' m getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager , then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year .' It ' s not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1 , ' Oh we need to get into action ' .' No , there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff , we think will be good for next season , regardless of what league we are in .' It would be slightly naive if we were not doing that . If I ' m in charge or not , I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here . 'McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible positionRangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re emerging from the embers of liquidation .The club ' s team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad .But McCall revealed the club ' s new board are now starting the process of re establishing their spying network albeit on a smaller level than before .' I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people , ' said the former Motherwell boss .' I don ' t think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet .' I don ' t think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere .Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years' But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place .' Having said that , I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with online service Wyscout . When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell , that was after I ' d seen a clip of him on YouTube . I sold him for 350 , 000 after signing him for nothing . That was great .' So you can still do your own background work . Personally I would always like to see the player myself . I ' ve only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it .' So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are , not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe . 'McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan ' s Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin .And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday ' s match with Falkirk .McCall ' s side are still in line for promotion , sitting in the play off positions in the Scottish ChampionshipPeter Houston ' s Bairns five points behind fourth placed Queen of the South with two games to play need an unlikely series of results to make the play offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers .He said : ' Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don ' t know what to expect .' It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play offs so I don ' t know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free .' They don ' t lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes . We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best . ' 	 0
BALTIMORE Astronomers analyzing the first images captured by the new Hubble Space Kaleidoscope , which went online Tuesday , announced that they ' ve acquired the first concrete evidence that the universe is in a constant state of total weirdness ." With their unprecedented resolution , the latest images from the new kaleidoscope reveal that space , once thought to be isotropic , is actually continuously expanding , unfolding , and rearranging in a series of freaky patterns , " said astronomer Douglas Stetler , head of the Space Kaleidoscope Science Institute in Baltimore . " It ' s an exciting time for the field of astrokaleidoscopics , or anyone interested in the vast , wacked out nature of space . "At 200 billion , the HSK , as scientists designate it , is the most expensive kaleidoscope ever built . Orbiting 300 miles above the Earth , the high powered , 12 ton optical device has revealed unexpected discoveries at the farthest reaches of the universe , including a multitude of brilliantly colored interlocking and rotating diamond things never before observed by scientists .HSK features three fine guidance optical control sensors , a wide field and planetary camera , a faint object spectrograph , and three primary rectangular plane mirrors inside a rotating 30 meter titanium tube . The object chamber , located on the end that gathers and focuses incoming light from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the infrared and ultraviolet continua , is filled with 10 , 000 pounds of marbles , costume jewelry , beads , and the largest bits of colored glass ever produced ." This new data will forever change how we look at the cosmos , " said Stetler , who admitted he was " amazed " to learn that all galaxies rotate in a counterclockwise direction and never look the same way twice . " Before this , we couldn ' t even see the Lagoon Nebula , but now we are capable of detecting up to 254 constantly changing fractal versions of it at once . The further we probe the depths of space , the better we might understand just how vastly bonkers it looks . "Construction of the Hubble Space Kaleidoscope involved incredible technical challenges . According to NASA head engineer Nathan Howard , assembling components for the object chamber was particularly exacting , since it was necessary to create baubles that would still remain pretty despite the harsh environment of space . The project also faced controversy over fears that the device would be unable to record the continuously changing symmetrical forms of solar masses , after early calculations predicted that the 898 million in trinkets would not tumble properly in a zero gravity environment ." Despite those setbacks , the project is an unqualified success , " Howard said . " The completed Hubble Kaleidoscope allows researchers to view the sharpest , most refracted displays of light , color , and shape to date . "Looking at a kaleidoscopic image of a dwarf star , Howard added , " Oooooo ! "Unlike the Hubble Telescope , which has allowed astronomers to view remote objects millions of light years away , the orbital kaleidoscopic observatory has taken humankind ' s knowledge of the cosmos one step further : Scientists now have access to clear images of the multicolored polygons and sparkling glitter now believed to cover up to 99 . 999 percent of the known universe .The new data have challenged nearly every assumption about astrophysical phenomena ." When we trained the powerful kaleidoscope lens on the massive eye of Jupiter , we expected to see a swirling behemoth of red and orange gas , " said Dr Mae Ling Turlington , who works at the observatory . " What we found instead was a dazzling hexagonal array of variegated prismatic configurations , changing our very understanding of the atmospheric patterns there on the solar system ' s spikiest looking planet . "Their findings are so startling , in fact , that kaleidoscopists are calling for standard models of the structure of the universe to be revamped . According to the new data , the so called asteroid " belt " is actually an asteroid squiggle and Mars is only red " some of the time , " vacillating between purplish blue , orange , and turquoise with specks of green as it moves along its six separate orbits around the sun .Despite excitement over the discovery that space is all crazy looking , a number of legislators have threatened to cut funding for NASA ' s kaleidoscopic program . An outspoken critic of the agency , Sen . Susan Collins ( R ME ) said she hopes NASA scientists don ' t just use the kaleidoscope a few times and then lose interest and never touch it again , like they did with the Brookhaven Neutrino Spirograph , Fermilab ' s Particle Slingshot , and the Very Large Slip ' n Slide Array in New Mexico . 	 1
u. s. republican presidential candidate jeb bush speaks at the growth and opportunity party at the iowa state fairgrounds in des moines, iowa, october 31, 2015. reuters brian c. frankin june, hillary clinton tried a relaunch, of sorts, her campaign with a rally on roosevelt island. it did not work because nothing had really changed since her launch video aired in april, either in the candidate or the message. it took a good debate performance and a horribly run house benghazi hearing to lift her spirits and poll numbers. now jeb bush is trying a relaunch. will he have any more luck? let s see what he is doing. the post reports : desperately seeking to revive a campaign rocked in recent weeks by budget cuts and a poor debate performance, republican presidential candidate jeb bush is hoping that his political past can jump start his political future. he will release a new e book this week, reply all, a raw, exhaustive anthology of hundreds of self selected e mails he sent and received as florida governor from 1999 to 2007.... a florida professor? said the book is likely to show that the governor was in the weeds on policy matters and was responsive to individual voters. his e mail sometimes can show a more emphatic side of him than his in person demeanor. i don t think the problem is that the voters are unaware he s in the weeds on policy. they know that. that does not help. and while competence and experience are advantageous, we don't elect policy briefing books we elect people with a vision. if anything ( and who, seriously will read it? ), the e book is counterproductive. a better idea : he should embrace his inner nerd. in florida he told an audience : but i have learned two important things from my time serving the people of florida : one, i can t be someone i m not. and, two, getting things done isn t about yelling into a camera or regurgitating sound bites free of substance, the former governor said. the campaign trail is littered with candidates disguised as television critics, politicians echoing poll tested pabulum. but leadership is something far different. it s not about telling people what they want to hear, but what they must hear. that s better, and it helps to point out the two front runners have such a weak grasp of the issues. nevertheless, attacking the superficial nature of campaigns and the exaggerated importance of debates still leaves a nagging question : how would he then defeat hillary clinton? confessing that he is a bad debater may be unavoidable but it underscores republicans belief he is not the best one to go toe to toe with hillary. he obviously meant it as a insult but when the bush campaign manager labeled rubio the gop obama, he inadvertently reminded voters that while it is great to have the bravest, experienced candidate or most generous candidate ( e. g. sen. john mccain, mitt romney ) you first need someone who is capable of winning. jeb is also rolling out the jeb can fix it tour. it remains to be seen whether that is old wine in new bottles, or whether he has a more forward looking message. it was not clear from the get go whether the party wanted another bush. his own limitations as a candidate make his race that much more challenging. but there are a couple things he could do. first, he has to have a better debate. unless he shows he could take on hillary clinton, the voters won t pick him as the nominee. period. to say expectations will be low for his next debate outing is a gross understatement. nevertheless, it is not enough to be not awful. he could use some of those forceful moments? perhaps against someone not as skilled as sen. marco rubio ( r fla. )? that go viral, a confrontation in which he actually prevails. he could take on trump on immigration or carson on his plan to vaporize medicare. but he needs to create? not just talk about? the contrast between informed conservative leader and dilettante. second, he needs to do what he said he would : offer a vision of the future. he is not going to win talking about what he has done in the past. the voters are not interested. he s got to tell them where he is headed and why he is the only one to get us there. that means no more petty attacks. no more talking process with the media. he wants to fix things, but fix what ( government? the economy? the culture? ) and in what way? he needs to spell it out. if it does not work, so be it. at least he will be proud of the race he ran, and not the goat saddled with responsibility if the eventual nominee he attacked loses. jennifer rubin writes the right turn blog for the post, offering reported opinion from a conservative perspective 	 0
washington a spokesperson for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives announced tuesday that the agency has intensified its manhunt for an individual suspected of bumming more than 75, 000 cigarettes nationwide. atf agents, who have tracked the elusive cigarette moocher for nearly four years, claimed they could be just days away from apprehending the " single greatest threat " to american smokers. " for far too long, this lowlife criminal has preyed upon unsuspecting cigarette owners, " atf spokesman stuart thompson said. " however, we are confident that recent developments will finally allow us to bring down this menace to justice once and for all. " " mark my words, " thompson continued. " his days of annoying the living crap out of smokers everywhere will soon be over. " representing the largest investigation in atf history, the nationwide dragnet has nearly exhausted the agency's resources, with daily operating costs exceeding 2. 5 million, and more than 1, 500 federal agents being mobilized in hopes of stopping the serial bummer before he strikes again. a special bulletin released by the atf warned that citizens should be on the lookout for a caucasian male in his early to mid 20s, with absolutely no sense of social etiquette whatsoever. the moocher is reportedly also known for having never once purchased his own pack of cigarettes, falsely claiming that he only smokes when he's been drinking, and thanking his victims to an insufferable degree after the bumming has occurred. in addition, investigators have described the freeloader as being constantly in need of a light. despite tracking the suspect on his cigarette bumming spree across three state lines, investigators have failed to detect any discernable pattern to the mooching. preliminary analysis has concluded that the perpetrator is equally comfortable stalking his victims around college campuses, parks, local bars, and at all hours of the day and night. in each instance, however, the moocher was observed to exploit the sympathies of nearby smokers by claiming that he had " just smoked his last one. " " this individual will say anything to get a cigarette, " said atf agent gene lorenzo, who while searching the agency's database found 20, 000 instances of the offender alleging that he was totally trying to quit, but was having a shitty day. " he's a smooth talker who befriends you, and before you know what's going on, half your pack is gone. " " and trust me, " lorenzo added. " he's never going to get you back like he promises. never. " since 2001, the atf has conducted interviews with people who have encountered the cigarette bummer to better understand how he chooses his victims. diane gustercan, a denver bank teller, said the culprit first approached her when she was having a smoke after work. " it was awful, " said gustercan, who helped officials assemble a profile of the bummer. " he came straight up to me and he said,'i hate to be that guy, and i hate to even ask, but do you think i could get a smoke off you?'" " i felt so helpless, " gustercan continued. " it was like there was nothing i could do. " " no smoker is safe while that man's still out there, " kentucky resident and local barfly dale richardson said. " he hit me up three times in the same night. tried to chat with me for a little bit too so i wouldn't feel bad about it. i finally just gave him a cigarette so he'd leave me alone. " according to an internal report, the perpetrator uses a number of clever cons to successfully mooch cigarettes. the agency's data confirmed that these include halfheartedly offering to pay 25 cents for a smoke, and hovering around two people engaged in conversation while desperately miming for a cigarette with his index and middle fingers. despite working with local law enforcement across the country, the atf has for months struggled to home in on the suspect, largely because he leaves so few clues behind. " six months ago, we received a tip that the moocher was at a staples parking lot in omaha, " agent alex leonard said. " we spent hours combing the area and finally came up with a cigarette, but it was burned beyond all recognition. " " he definitely knows what he's doing, " leonard continued. " sooner or later though, he's bound to slip up. and when he does, we'll be there. we'll catch that slimy piece of shit. " a break in the case this morning nearly netted the notorious moocher, but officials reportedly let the fugitive slip away when he approached several officers during their smoke break, asked for a cigarette, and quietly went on 	 1
With the Olympics in full swing , London Mayor , Boris Johnson , is being called on to be at a dozen photo shoots a day , and even with the Olympic cycle lanes in London he is finding it impossible to get to every engagement on time .Instead , Madam Tussards has been drafted in to supply photo shoots with a waxwork of Boris Johnson ." It ' s very lifelike , " said Deborah Taunt , one of the official photographers for the Olympics . " I ' d go as far to say I prefer having the waxwork . I can get more sense out of it . When I ' ve photographed the real Boris , it ' s hard to get him to stand still for a minute while I compose the shot . "So successful has the waxwork of Johnson been , that the Mayoral office is considering using the waxwork for more official engagements ." This will free up Boris for events where his peculiar brand of English Toffyness is required , " said Mary Horal , event co ordinator for the Mayor ' s office . " For anything that just requires him to stand their looking vacant , we now have an alternative to the real Boris , one that ' s just as good , if not better . "Boris himself is quite pleased that some of the more boring duties can now be carried out by an oversized candle ." Oh , it ' s bloody marvellous , what ? " he said . " If we can get it to ride a bike , I could go on holiday and leave it in charge . "Having come up with the idea , the Mayor ' s Office have contacted leading robotic engineers at Manchester University to create such a stand in , as they are desperate to have Johnson out of the building and replaced with something that has a higher IQ and makes less mistakes ." We ' re all dreaming of the day , " said Horal . 	 1
los angeles noting that ticket sales nationwide have fallen to a 20 year low, a study published friday by the motion picture association of america found that movie theater attendance continues to decline as more americans choose to act out films at home. according to the study, rising ticket prices across the country, combined with the greater convenience of staying in, have contributed to the popularity of performing full length feature films in the comfort of individuals'own living rooms. " whereas previous generations of moviegoers would look forward to new movie releases and head to their local theater on a friday or saturday night, today's entertainment consumers are increasingly choosing to print out screenplays, cast friends and family in the various roles, and act out films without ever leaving their houses or apartments, " said mpaa analyst tate mitchell, citing the fact that in 2015, more than 80 million households acted out summer blockbusters on their opening weekends, including jurassic world and mission : impossible rogue nation, rather than viewing them on the big screen, a 14 percent increase over the previous year. " savings aside, this option also provides people with a much greater variety of movies to act out, from the latest big budget action adventure films, dramas, and romantic comedies to hollywood classics, documentaries, and foreign films. " " when people are faced with choosing one of a limited number of fixed showtimes, driving to and from the theater, and finding seats together among scores of strangers, it's easy to see why staying home and performing a film or even two makes more sense, " he continued. in a survey conducted by entertainment industry analytics firm rentrak, moviegoers cited cost as the main reason for avoiding the theater, noting that the price for a family of four attending the pixar hit inside out in theaters could reach 50, compared with the 12. 95 it would cost to run off four copies of the script at a nearby print and copy center. taking 20 children to the same movie for a birthday party would cost as much as 200, excluding soda and snacks, compared to the much lower cost of letting the children act it out in a parent's basement or rec room. additionally, 72 percent of respondents said they enjoyed the flexibility of home acting versus watching movies in the theater, noting that if one of them needed to use the restroom or get more popcorn during a pivotal scene, the actors could pause the performance and do another take when the person got back. nearly two thirds of those polled also cited a lack of advertisements before performances as a benefit, as moviegoers were able to jump right into the film without performing any trailers, or only act out the trailers they were most excited about. " the first avengers film made billions of dollars worldwide, but when the sequel came out, people said, you know what, instead of waiting in line for this, let's just act it out at home or go over to the neighbors'and see them perform it. "'parents in particular said they enjoyed knowing that, unlike seeing a new movie in theaters, performing films at home allowed them to make edits and script notes to protect their children from gratuitously violent or sexual material. " last weekend, the whole family decided to act out the master, so my husband and i made sure to remove all the inappropriate stuff from the script before we started, " said 38 year old cincinnati area mother janice dewins, who played the roles of lancaster dodd's wife, peggy, the salesgirl martha, and several other supporting characters. " my 8 year old son was freddie quell, who gets hooked on a mix of alcohol and gasoline, but we just had him drink orange juice instead. it was nice to be able to stop the performance at any time to explain to him what was going on or to comfort him whenever anything he was acting out got too scary. " " we obviously cut that whole explicit scene where peggy pleasures lancaster in the bathroom, " dewins added. other moviegoers went on to say they particularly appreciated being able to prepare their own concessions at home instead of paying exorbitant theater prices. rather than shell out 12 to 14 for a bucket of popcorn, many families said they make their own in the microwave, while others explained how they pour three cans of soda into a large cup to create their own 36 ounce beverage. many industry insiders have taken notice of the trend, and admitted that as americans put on millions of productions of movies every year performances that are becoming much more nuanced, layered, and compelling as consumers hone their craft the traditional model of film distribution may soon become entirely obsolete. " the first avengers film made billions of dollars worldwide, but when the sequel came out, people said, you know what, instead of waiting in line for this, let's just act it out at home or go over to the neighbors'and see them perform it, "'said walt disney studios spokesperson eric rudolph, who admitted that he and his wife recently 	 1
Hurricane Sandy gave the Eastern seaboard a real pounding this week , with heavy rain , widespread flooding and high winds .In addition to damage from water and wind , the East Coast is experiencing cascading effects of power outages and disrupted transportation systems . Downed power lines have led to fires and electrocutions . Widespread shutdowns of government and business operations are curtailing economic activity .More than 50 lives have been lost . It is too early to get an estimate of damages , but the economic costs will likely amount to billions or perhaps tens of billions of dollars . The element of risk is epitomized by the disabled boom of a construction crane , dangling 80 stories over the streets of Manhattan , an all too real sword of Damocles .Many of the areas buffeted by Sandy were hit by Hurricane Irene in August of 2011 .What is going on ? Is the punch from Sandy or the one two pounding from Irene and then Sandy a consequence of climate change or an unlucky roll of the climate dice ?The evidence is not yet in for the East Coast in 2011 and 2012 , but the general trends are increasingly clear . In its 2012 report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded that " A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency , intensity , spatial extent , duration , and timing of extreme weather and climate events , and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events . "Many observations and many lines of evidence support this conclusion . Yet , the fact that hurricanes and other climate extremes occur only rarely means that it is very difficult to know for sure that the recent pattern is really outside the range of historical variation .Globally , we don ' t have conclusive evidence that hurricanes are increasing , but we do see a clear indication that the major storm tracks outside the tropics are moving further from the equator .From the perspective of expected damages , two trends highlight causes for concern . First , economic losses from weather related disasters have increased over the last several decades . This is mostly because of increases in the value of the assets in harm ' s way . Second , sea level is rising . Globally , sea level is now about 6 inches higher than in 1900 .This may not sound like much , but a modest change can have big effects . Flooding from storm surge is a classic threshold event . If the waves are 1 inch below the top of the sea wall , there is no damage . One inch above leads to flooding . This combination of increasing exposure and increasing sea level is gradually notching up the level of risk .What can be done ? For disaster managers , the long standing foundations for effectiveness are preparation , response , and recovery . So far , disaster management agencies , from the local to the national level , have taken Sandy very seriously , appropriate for a storm of its magnitude .The tradition in disaster management has been to base planning on past experiences . That ' s a reasonable approach when the future looks basically like the past . But it is a recipe for regret when climate and development are changing . Much can be done to incorporate new knowledge into disaster management , including steps to reduce the risks of future disasters .One key is recognizing that the future won ' t be like the past . To cope with changes in climate , development and population , we should be building climate and sea level projections into infrastructure planning , building codes and plans for managing disasters .We have the scientific knowledge and engineering knowledge to improve all three phases of disaster risk reduction preparation , response and recovery . But we don ' t know everything .As a consequence , it is important to make learning by doing an integral part of disaster management . We need to continue to refine our understanding of the role of climate change in altering the risks , at the same time we test technologies and strategies for dealing with a future that we know will be different from the past .Climate change is occurring now .

earth the entire world population confirmed friday that houston rockets center yao ming is the greatest athlete in the history of sports and a glowing symbol of what hardworking citizens may become if they remain loyal to their government. yao ming officially averages 84 points per basketball game and has a shooting percentage of. 9999998, chinese basketball officials said. furthermore, yao ming is perfectly healthy and, in fact, cannot be injured. yao ming is also a universally acknowledged beacon of humility and respect, and on the exceedingly rare occasion when he does miss a shot, he no doubt does so on purpose, selflessly ensuring that his lesser american teammates feel better about their own lackluster shooting percentages. again, yao ming has suffered no physical harm, and his condition is like unto that of his home nation : inviolate, resilient, and eternally renewed. his left foot is also fine. luminaries in the field of basketball, including legends pat riley and red auerbach, must surely opine with great fervor and intensity that teammate tracy mcgrady should always pass the ball to yao ming, as yao ming's basketball skills are monumentally better than mcgrady's. yao ming is also glorious. additionally, yao ming is the light. yao ming is the best! " like every professional basketball player, i grew up watching and idolizing yao ming, " former chicago bulls player michael jordan has surely said. " his play reminds me of the ancient cao cao poem,'walking from xiamen and looking at the blue sea.'the poem ends,'the path of the sun and moon, seems to come from within. the splendid milky way, seems to come from inside. oh, i am so lucky, to be singing my song!'" " to me, the poem means that yao ming's excellent play spans the entire universe and radiates such sheer beauty that mere mortals will never be able to comprehend it, " jordan would certainly add. " we are lucky to be able to experience the magnificent play of yao ming in our lifetime. i now admit that i retired because i feared facing him in competition. " on friday, nba commissioner david stern will doubtless call a special press conference to say the following : " everything about yao ming is amazing. his jumping is amazing. his shooting is amazing. his ability to make those around him better is amazing. this league would collapse without him, and we thank china for this precious, precious gift! " commissioner stern will not address the scandalous rumors of an injury to yao ming, because all people know that such rumors are laughable and could not be true. " yao ming's play, " stern shall continue, " is better than shaquille o'neal's, magic johnson's, kareem abdul jabbar's, pete " pistol man " maravich's, and dwyane wade's combined. also kobe bryant's and everyone else's. tracy mcgrady should pass the ball to yao ming at all times for these very reasons. " stern's comments will meet with no argument from those reporters gathered at the press conference, because those statements are pure and true. yao ming, who at 28 will soon be the only active player ever to be inducted into the nba hall of fame, learned to play basketball when he was 3 years old after finding an untamed cobra in the mountains, a cobra of ancient legend whose very breath was poisonous. the cobra was taller than a full grown tree, and beat yao in one on one basketball competition every day for 19 straight years. then, the very night before their final game, yao prayed deeply to his ancestors and ingested more than 20 pounds of yu wan mei fish by products, and behold! yao grew three feet while he slept. yao beat the cobra 11 0 the following morning, beheaded it with a great spear, fashioned a graceful sailing vessel from its colossal body, and rode this vessel across the pacific ocean to play professional basketball in the united states. there, yao ming became leader of the rockets after receiving the mandate of heaven from previous team captain hakeem olajuwon. it is worth repeating, sources confirmed, that tracy mcgrady should always pass the ball to yao ming. " my dream is to one day coach yao ming, " believes cleveland cavaliers coach mike brown, echoing the obvious thoughts of every nba coach. " i look at the players i have on my team now, and i fear that without yao we will simply be an empty boat floating further out to sea while the nba championship trophy floats further and further inland. " yao ming will win the next 15 nba titles. " if i were a smart man instead of an egotistical, stupid man, incapable of putting the success of the whole before my own selfish needs, i would always pass the ball to yao, " disgraceful, and genuinely injured 	 1
The law on assisted suicide in Switzerland isn ' t clear , according to a paper published in the journal Law , Ethics and Medicine on August 20 . That ' s why , the authors say , people from other countries are traveling to the state of Zurich for the " sole purpose of committing suicide . "They ' re called suicide tourists .Between 2008 and 2012 , 611 " tourists " came to Switzerland for assisted suicide , according to the published analysis . They arrived from 31 countries around the world , though the majority were from Germany and the United Kingdom ." In the UK , at least , ' going to Switzerland ' has become a euphemism for ( assisted suicide ) , " the study authors write . " Six right to die organizations assist in approximately 600 cases of suicide per year some 150 200 of which are suicide tourists . "This published paper is the result of a pilot study completed for a larger project on assisted suicide in Switzerland being done by experts at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Zurich .Of the 611 assisted suicides identified during the four year study period , just over 58 were women . The patients ' ages ranged from 23 to 97 , researchers found , but the average age was 69 . Close to half of the patients had a neurological disease . Others stated they had cancer , rheumatic disease or cardiovascular disease . Many had more than one condition .In all but four cases , the assisted suicides were done using sodium pentobarbital . A fatal dose of this drug causes the patient to slip into a deep coma , according to DIGNITAS , a Swiss right to die organization that was involved in most of the identified cases . Sodium pentobarbital paralyzes the patient ' s respiratory system , causing him or her to stop breathing .The total number of suicide tourism cases dropped from 123 in 2008 to 86 in 2009 . But the number of cases doubled between 2009 and 2012 , to 172 .Assisted suicide laws around the globe are in flux as countries debate the pros and cons of allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients , or patients in a lot of pain , die .In Switzerland , the study authors write , there are no rules to regulate under which conditions someone can receive assisted suicide , though medical professional codes allow it in certain circumstances .In Germany , there is no formal legal language in the criminal code about assisted suicide , but doctors are not ethically allowed to help someone commit suicide and can be held criminally responsible for not helping a patient if they witness him or her going unconscious .In the United Kingdom , Ireland and France , assisted suicide is illegal , though recent cases have been presented to high courts ." If Switzerland is happy to continue providing the facility then , however intellectually dishonest it may be to allow her to siphon of all our own English pain , fear , angst and debate , is it likely to do less harm overall than introducing any conceivable assisted suicide law into England , " medical lawyer Charles Foster wrote in a commentary accompanying the new journal study .An international survey of 12 European countries found the majority of people favor legalizing assisted suicide , according to the study authors . This seems to match opinion in the United States , where four states Oregon , Washington , Montana and Vermont allow assisted suicide .Opinion : Suicide doesn ' t set you freeBut others have argued that legalizing assisted suicide is not addressing the real issue , which is the need for better palliative care , and that assisted suicide laws would put vulnerable populations at risk .Alison Twycross of London South Bank University , in an editorial accompanying the new study , writes that advocates for assisted suicide often have a friend or relative who experienced a long , painful death . " So the issue , " she writes , " may be a need to provide good end of life care . "" We need to start asking questions such as : Is it appropriate to give antibiotics to a terminally ill patient who develops a chest infection ? It is possible that a tendency to carry on with curative treatment even in those clearly dying explains the general public ' s support for ( assisted suicide ) . "Twycross cites data from Oregon that suggests regulations put in place when assisted suicide was legalized are not always followed ." Autonomy is important , " she writes . " But it could be that , in matters of life and death , you cannot create freedom for the few without taking away adequate safeguards for the many . " 	 0
TOKYO , HONG KONG , SEOUL Asian stocks closed one of the worst and most mournfully reflective months on record last week , with the falling American dollar negatively impacting trade volume and causing the markets to drift , like the faded cherry petals of spring blossoms , downward towards the shadowed sea of burgeoning recession , Eastern market analysts warned Monday ." Our worst monthly drop rate cuts make investors flee to commodities , " Nikkei Index vice commissioner Fukako Mishima said , claiming job creation by Mitsubishi , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , and Sony failed to provide confidence in a market already as skittish as the aging husband of a teenage bride , forcing investors to shore up cash reserves with orders of durable goods and agricultural products . " Fading dollar ' s gleam , a feeble warning beacon : Seek bellies of pork . "Hong Kong reported similar woes . Analysts there said the slow chrysanthemum ' s bloom of gains from foreign investment had entered a season of cold mists that sent tendrils creeping , creeping among the reeds , stagnant equity , and low hooting owls from which nothing but fever , longing , and gradually downgraded credit ratings were expected to result .By the end of trading Monday , the Hong Kong dollar was trading at . 13 USD , close to a record low , and currency brokers were exchanging subtle barbs and veiled insults as do former lovers . Volume was only moderate in both cases ." Our speculation economy was spring wine to those who believed the Middle Kingdom could support an emerging middle class , and that while American and European currency stimulated growth , all would prosper , " said Jin Fusen , an executive investment director for ING at the Hong Kong bourse . " But it seems that we were attempting to ascend to the Monkey King ' s Heaven by treading upon a bridge cunningly crafted of obedient birds and lo ! In our haste , one foot falls too heavily now through a clouded sky , roiled with feathers and harsh cries of alarm , we plummet . "In addition , durable goods inventories gathered dust in Asian warehouses while salesmen sought buyers , and buyers sought more favorable credit , and all concerned adopted the aspect of a light thirsting silk moth wavering between the cold celestial glory of a waxing moon and the sudden treacherous heat of the lantern ' s flame ." At sun ' s crimson dawning , storm grumbles , mounting , ripples of the sky and sea reflected in late trading , " said Lee Woo hyun , a strategist at Kyobo Securities in Seoul who had warned bankers in 2004 that the American real estate bubble was as artificially inflated and volatile as a gaily painted pig ' s bladder played with by dust covered street urchins . " Now the rain comes , from trees striking leaf and blossom both , uncaring . Not to mention gold will soon crest 950 U . S . an ounce as I grow old without grandsons . "Still , some traders refuse to be affected by the gloom that hovers over the Eastern markets like mulberry smoke over an autumn hearth , maintaining that dramatic market corrections in an era of increasing globalization are only to be expected ." Panic ' s first impulse : Fear freezes traders solid , whispers of rate cuts . Quick fix attempted , the currency devalued instability ! " Morningstar Japan ' s Hideyuki Suzuki intoned . " But putting our trust in rate cuts won ' t work in the long term , and blind faith in the overprotective vertical structure of the zaibatsu system is simply wrong ." The plain fact is , we have to break the rigid pattern of 5 percent market drop , 7 point rate cut , 5 percent market rise , which has become almost an Asian stereotype , and start looking elsewhere for inspiration . "" What Asian businessmen are being forced to realize is that we have to adopt a more global , perhaps even a more Western , way of thinking , " Suzuki added . " Two financial roads are about to diverge , and we must take the one less traveled by . When the books close on fiscal 2008 , it may make all the difference . " 	 1
INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan was campaigning in Indianapolis , the town that was named after the Cleveland Indians .He told a crowd that had gathered in the parking lot of a Fishy Smell Seafood Grill that he and Mitt Romney are going to show the American people that they are more American than President Obama and Vice President Biden .Little Bunny Foo Foo , as Ryan has been nicknamed by Vice President Joe Biden , stated that his last name is much more American sounding than Biden ' s name .Someone in the crowd wearing a blue gimme cap hollered out that the name Romney sounds Russian .Ryan giggled and said that just because a name sounds a certain way does not mean that it means a certain thing .The man in the blue gimme cap yelled out , " What are you talking about Skippy ? "Ryan shouted back that his name is not Skippy and that he does not want anyone to call him that ." Hey Eddie Munster " shouted out another voice ." How about Beaver Cleaver ? How does that sound to you ? "Ryan just shook his head and asked if everyone in Indiana was as arrogant as this crowd was .The crowd broke out in a thunderous chorus of boos .A deep voice from the back asked Ryan if he could see Russia from his home in Wisconsin .He grinned and replied " Well , as a matter of fact fella , when the weather is perfectly clear , I can actually see Russia from my back porch . "The crowd erupted in laughter and started shouting out " JOE BI DEN ! JOE BI DEN ! JOE BI DEN ! "Ryan got pissed off and boarded his Wisconsin Cheese Whiz GOP Vice Presidential Campaign Bus .In Clint Eastwood News . 82 year old Eastwood has just announced that he is writing a book on GOP comedic anecdotes to be titled , The Good , The Bad , and The Empty Chair . 	 1
Published : 16 : 43 EST , 14 January 2016 Updated : 16 : 43 EST , 14 January 2016AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP ) ? Critics of Maine Gov . Paul LePage failed to muster support for a vote Thursday on an independent investigation that could have led to impeachment for alleged abuse of power .LePage responded by calling the impeachment effort " nonsense " and " foolishness . "A group led by Democratic Rep . Ben Chipman of Portland wanted to punish the brash and outspoken Republican governor for pressuring a charter school operator into rescinding a job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves .FILE In this Jan . 8 , 2016 , file photo , Gov . Paul LePage speaks at a news conference at the State House in Augusta , Maine . Critics of LePage on Thursday , Jan . 14 , took up a longshot bid to impeach him over allegations of abuse of power . ( AP Photo Robert F . Bukaty , File )But impeachment supporters were unable to overcome a Republican effort to indefinitely postpone discussion .The Republican governor was defiant afterward , issuing a statement in which he described the impeachment attempt as " a political witch hunt that had absolutely no merit . "" While some members of the Legislature were obsessing for months over this foolishness , I have been working on the real issues that matter to the Maine people , " LePage said . He declined to leave his office to meet with reporters , and he tweeted that it was " business as usual . "House lawmakers voted 96 52 to indefinitely table debate after House Republican leader Ken Fredette introduced a motion to pre empt any action on the impeachment order . The motion succeeded after about three hours of tense debate .LePage is known for a blunt style and off the cuff remarks that get him into trouble .He was criticized just last week after saying out of state drug dealers with names like " D Money , Smoothie , Shifty " sell heroin in Maine and " half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave . " He later apologized for the comment , calling it a slip of the tongue .But Thursday ' s debate focused more on his actions .LePage ' s foes wanted to look into a number of allegations that they say shows a pattern of bullying and abuse , including that he forced out the president of the Maine Community College System , refused to allow administration officials to testify in front of committees and involved himself in the internal workings of the unemployment compensation board .After the vote , a group of outraged LePage critics shouted " shameful ! " and " dereliction of duty ! " from the gallery . A security detail quickly removed them .Afterward , Eves blamed the governor ' s actions for creating an " extremely sad day in our state ' s history . "" The governor has certainly created an environment where legislators are looking over their shoulders when they ' re casting votes , " he said . " We are better than this . "Some Democrats had said that ignoring the governor ' s behavior sets a precedent for future chief executives to run roughshod over the legislative branch . Rep . Charlotte Warren of Hallowell invoked the name of Maine ' s Bill Cohen , who as a freshman Republican on the U . S . House Judiciary Committee broke with his party to vote to impeach President Richard Nixon ." You know in your heart that what ' s going on around here is not right . Today follow your heart , " she said . " Stand up for the Maine tradition . "Rep . Lawrence E . Lockman , R Amherst , said the governor did the right thing in questioning Eves ' hiring , suggesting the House speaker had unfair advantages ." Given what we now know about the hiring process , I believe the chief executive deserves not an impeachment order but a public service award for blowing the whistle on Good Will Hinckley , " Lockman told the chamber .An impeachment order , which was viewed as a longshot , would have been be unprecedented . It also wouldn ' t likely have survived long because it would eventually go to the Republican controlled Senate .The state attorney general , Democrat Janet Mills , already declined to investigate LePage ' s conduct . She said there was no evidence he committed a crime when he pressured Good Will Hinckley , an organization that serves at risk young people and runs a charter school , to rescind the job offer to Eves .Rep . Jeffrey Evangelos of Friendship , a political independent and supporter of impeachment proceedings , said Maine leaders missed an opportunity to take on the governor , whom he called a " right wing bully " who gives the state a bad name . 	 0

san diego according to a university of california san diego study released monday, sexism is rampant throughout the natural world, particularly among the highest classes of vertebrates. " when we first decided to examine attitudes and behaviors toward gender roles among non humans, we were wholly unprepared for what we would find, " said jennifer tannen, leader of the ucsd research team, a joint venture between the school's zoology and women's studies departments. " females living in the wild routinely fall victim to everything from stereotyping to exclusion from pack activities to sexual harassment. " nowhere is the natural world's gender inequity more transparent, tannen said, than in the unfair burden females assume for the rearing of offspring. " take the behavior of the ring neck pheasant, " tannen said. " after mating, the male immediately abandons the hen, leaving her responsible for the total care for the chicks. for the single mother to be, there is no assistance, either in the form of a partner or child support. nor is there any legal recourse. it's despicable. " tannen said pheasants are typical of the natural world, where a mere 5 percent of animal species mate for life. among species that do form lasting pairs, the situation barely improves : females must remain close to the nest to incubate eggs, nurse, and keep watch over the burrow while males are free to go off hunting and fishing with their friends. " the sexist attitude that child rearing is'women's work'is prevalent throughout nature and has been for generations, probably since reptiles first developed mammalian characteristics in the triassic period, " tannen said. " sadly, most creatures never pause to challenge these woefully outdated gender roles. " tannen stressed the need to hold high those rare examples of species that do form caring, mutually supportive relationships. " wolves, beavers, gibbons, and a small african antelope known as a dik dik all live in stable, monogamous pairs, " tannen said. " other animals need to look to them as positive models if we are to have any hope of one day creating an ecosystem of understanding and respect. " more seriously, in addition to an unfair division of labor, nature is rife with sexual abuse and harassment. the ucsd study estimates that in 2001 alone, more than 170 trillion cases of abuse occurred in the world's forests, grasslands, and oceans all of them unreported. " during the act of mating, the female moose is subject to excessive biting, nipping, and herding, " tannen said. " the male has no qualms about using sheer, brute force to overpower his sex partner, and the female, accustomed to this sort of rough treatment after millions of years of it, doesn't even realize there's something wrong. " " then, when it's time for the bull moose to complete the sexual act, " tannen continued, " it's over in about five seconds, with no regard to female pleasure whatsoever. typical. " adding insult to injury, tannen said, the bull moose then heads off to mate with dozens more females over a period of two to three weeks, justifying his behavior as " part of the mardi gras like atmosphere of'mating season.'" with other species, darker situations unfold. " to mate, the male galapagos tortoise simply immobilizes the female with his weight, which, as far as i'm concerned, qualifies as non consensual sex, " tannen says. " female southern elephant seals gather in large groups during mating season, and each group has a small handful of males who control them like a harem. it's sick. " when female animals refuse to play along with prescribed gender roles, tannen said, they are demonized. for example, female foxes, known throughout the animal kingdom for their aggressiveness, are labeled " vixen. " " we've all heard the lurid tales about the female black widow spider, who kills and eats her mate, " tannen said. " the truth is, male spiders encourage their partners to kill them because it increases the time spent mating and, thus, the number of eggs fertilized by his sperm. but no one condemns the male for his part in this destructive relationship. " ucsd researchers identified 24 distinct male behaviors designed to perpetuate gender inequity and preserve the prevailing power structure. among these dominance asserting behaviors are chest puffing, plumage spreading, and antler growth. the ucsd study is not without its detractors. glen otis brown, author of forced to strut : reverse sexism in the animal world, countered that male animals are victims of " the beauty myth " as much as females 	 1
U . S . presidential contender Donald Trump poses for the media during the third day of the Women s British Open golf championship on his Turnberry golf course in Turnberry , Scotland , in this Aug . 1 , 2015 , file photo . ( AP Photo Scott Heppell File ) moreDonald Trump spent more than 400 , 000 in the last three months to manufacture his iconic Make America Great Again hats , and another 450 , 000 on signature drives to make sure he s met the requirements to get on the ballots in this year s GOP primaries .Meanwhile , erstwhile chief opponent Jeb Bush s single biggest expense was the more than 660 , 000 he paid to the IRS between October and December ? the amount of payroll taxes he owed on the bloated campaign organization he d hoped would carry him to victory in the GOP presidential primary .But both of them are pikers compared to the Democrats , where Hillary Clinton spent 7 million on staffing in the last three months of 2015 , and paid 3 . 7 million in payroll taxes , and Sen . Bernard Sanders spent nearly 3 million on campaign paraphernalia .The year end reports were filed the day before the first votes were to be cast Monday in Iowa s caucuses . The numbers covered up through Dec . 31 ? an eon ago in political terms , but still suggestive of how the campaigns had positioned themselves heading into the new year .Mrs Clinton and Mr Bush had both spent heavily on traditional style campaigns , with a giant paid staff , rent and travel costs .We re heading into the first caucuses and primaries with an organization second to none thanks to the support of hundreds of thousands of people across the country and have the resources necessary to wage a successful campaign in the early states and beyond , Mrs Clinton s campaign manager , Robby Mook , said in a statement Sunday night announcing the numbers . We ve focused on investing in people to organize and turn out voters and in preparing for the map to expand beyond the early states .The same with Mr Trump , the iconoclastic billionaire candidate who has taken the lead in the GOP field , who spent his money on consultants , ballot access and the hats , yard signs and stickers that the master of marketing has pushed on his fans .Then there s Sen . Ted Cruz , the man who s closest to challenging Mr Trump in the polls , who s spent his money on research and renting potential voter lists , hoping to identify supporters and then target them to turn out at the caucuses or polls in the first primary contests .On the fundraising side , Mrs Clinton led all candidates in both parties with 38 . 1 million raised in the final quarter of 2015 . Mr Sanders was close behind with 33 . 6 million .Among Republicans , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson continued to rake in the cash with 22 . 6 million raised ? though he also spent a good chunk of that money on direct marketing , which helped him raise the money in the first place .Mr Cruz raised 20 . 5 million , Sen . Marco Rubio raised 14 . 2 million and Mr Bush raised just 7 . 1 million .Mr Trump reported receipts of 13 . 6 million in the quarter ? with 10 . 8 million of that coming from a loan he extended to his campaign . He has said he would self fund his bid for the GOP nomination , saying it gives him a leg up on his competitors , who he said end up owing favors to their big donors . 	 0

SOMERVILLE , MA After living with roommates for the better part of a decade , local woman Anne Lazar announced Tuesday she was excited to finally experience the overwhelming loneliness of having her own apartment .Lazar , 31 , said that while she had few serious complaints about the people with whom she had shared housing over the years , there was simply no substitute for the unrelenting sense of isolation that only a private space can provide ." I couldn ' t be more thrilled , " said Lazar , who moved into her new single bedroom apartment three days ago . " There comes a point when you ' re ready to move on and feel utterly cut off from society , and you just can ' t get that without a living room of your own . Now I ' ll have the couch all to myself and can watch Parks and Recreation with only my solitary , slightly forced laughter echoing off the walls . You can ' t beat that . "" Sure , I ' m spending a little more on rent , " Lazar added . " But what I ' ll be repaid in those moments of desperately wishing a friend would call or e mail or do pretty much anything to momentarily take me out of my own head will be priceless . "While Lazar acknowledged her new living situation would likely take some adjustment , she told reporters it wouldn ' t be long before she ' d be happily lying awake at night wishing she at least had a pet to keep her company ." I ' ll probably feel little or no dread at all during these first few weeks , " Lazar said . " I might ask myself if this was such a good idea and if I ' ll ever grow morbidly starved for companionship . But if I stick with it , I know it ' ll only be a matter of time before I can ' t even iron a blouse without a podcast playing in the background just so I can hear the sound of other human beings interacting . "" Honestly , I can ' t believe I waited so long to do this , " Lazar added . " Even the best roommates in the world can ' t match the eerie feeling that comes from sitting in your own place and wondering how long it would take for anyone to find your body if you had a heart attack and dropped dead . "At press time , Lazar confirmed that she was settling in better than expected and that there was nothing quite like suddenly bursting into tears at a kitchen table with only one place setting . 	 1

A police officer who fatally shot a 93 year old woman at her home in Texas is defending his use of deadly force and lashing out at the City Council that fired him .Stephen Stem was dismissed from the Hearne Police Department on Saturday . He argues his termination was unjust ." The knee jerk reaction to terminate Mr Stem was not about whether Ms . Golden chose to create and perpetuate a life threatening situation . That is a clear and indisputable fact ." Rather , the city ' s decision was about appeasing certain members of the community who want to make this case about Ms . Golden ' s age , the fact she is African American , or the fact she is a woman ." None of those factors played a role in Stem ' s decision to use deadly force , " Robert McCabe , Stem ' s attorney , said in a statement Sunday .His comments come as Texas Rangers continue an investigation into why Pearlie Golden , a longtime resident in this small town of about 4 , 600 people between Dallas and Houston , was shot multiple times at her home Tuesday .A man believed to be a relative of Golden ' s made a 911 call asking for help from police , Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said ." What I understand is ( Hearne police ) were called out because a woman was brandishing a firearm , " Siegert said ." An officer asked her to put the handgun down , and when she would not , shots were fired . "Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr . said Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times .Stem fired three times , and Golden was hit at least twice , he said .She was transported to a hospital , where she died ." Police not only have a duty to protect themselves from imminent harm , but also innocent citizens who rely on them ' to protect and serve , ' " Stem ' s attorney said in his statement .The case eventually will be presented to a grand jury , which is standard procedure when dealing with officer involved incidents , according to Russ , the city attorney ." I would expect people to be upset about this , a young police officer shooting a 93 year old lady , " Russ said . " I ' m upset about it . Most of our citizens are upset , but at the same time , I don ' t believe all the facts have come to the surface yet . " 	 0
curry lights up wizards for warriors'8th straight winwashington, dc february 03 : stephen curry 30 of the golden state warriors celebrates after scoring in the foiurth quarter against the washington wizards at verizon center on february 3, 2016 in washington, dc. the warriors defeated the wizards 134 to 121. ( photo by rob carr getty images ) washington ( ap ) following one of his worst offensive games this season, reigning nba mvp stephen curry stopped thinking about basketball and recalibrated his mind. it worked out just fine. curry was all systems go wednesday night as he made 11 3 pointers and scored 51 points to lead the golden state warriors past the washington wizards 134 121 for their eighth straight victory, which came in spite of a monster performance from john wall. wall scored a season best 41 points in the shadows as curry shot 13 of 14 for 36 points in the best first half of his career. after scoring just 13 points sunday at new york, curry was in a zone, tying gilbert arenas and michael jordan for the verizon center record and reaching 50 for the second time this season.'' the shots that you know feel good go in, and some of the shots that you're like, oh that's off,'they end up going in,'' curry said.'' it's a fun feeling, and you want to ride that until you can't anymore.'' curry looked human when he missed seven of 10 shots during the third quarter but was dominant most of the night as the warriors ( 45 4 ) matched the 1966 67 philadelphia 76ers for the best 49 game start in nba history.'' it's like kobe ( bryant ) when he had 81,'' wall said.'' he couldn't miss. you keep defending the best way you can. we challenged some shots. he didn't have too many open looks. he just made them.'' curry's 5 of 17 shooting performance against the knicks was all forgotten by the end of this game. not like coach steve kerr was worried.'' i didn't know steph was in a slump,'' kerr said.'' steph's never in a slump.'' curry made his first six shots from the floor and was feeling it, especially from 3 point territory. he came one 3 short of tying the single game record, and though it was on his mind, he didn't start popping shots just to reach it as the game got out of hand.'' i was kind of searching but not trying to force with where the game was,'' curry said.'' you can't mess around with the basketball gods trying to chase a record if the game doesn't call for it.'' the game called for plenty of baskets because of 18 golden state turnovers, including seven from curry. kerr said that needs to change if the warriors want to defend their nba title. many of those turnovers turned into points for wall, who shot 17 of 25 and added 10 assists to set the tone for the wizards ( 21 26 ), who led early but never got closer than two after the first quarter.'' i was just being aggressive and doing whatever shots i had,'' wall said.'' it was just a fast paced game. ( i was ) also attacking the basket and getting to the rim a little bit.'' wall was doing all those things, but curry was doing it all. he finished 19 of 28 and 11 of 26 from 3 but was still kicking himself for the turnovers more than reveling in the points.'' it's one of those games i think i had probably three of them that i shouldn't have had just a couple lazy passes, telegraphed passes,'' curry said.'' it happens, but it's frustrating because when they happen, that's when they got back in the game and you don't want to give them any life with transition or easy fast break opportunities where we can't get our defense set and i was the culprit plenty of times.'' twenty years after he and the chicago bulls won their record setting 72nd game of the 1995 96 season against the washington bullets in landover, maryland, kerr returned to the area as warriors coach seeing a lot of similarities as far as the attention the teams received.'' it was a pretty big deal then, obviously with michael ( jordan ) drawing so much attention everywhere we went,'' kerr said.'' i think today things are bigger in a lot of ways with social media and so many different media outlets. and steph is getting a lot of notoriety, obviously, and drawing fans and media everywhere we go.'' warriors : golden state reached 30 assists for the eighth consecutive game, the most since charlotte had 13 in a row in 1989.... the team is 	 0

Shweyga Mullah ' s face lights up with a smile that spreads like a sunrise across her face .She ' s just arrived at a party , organized by the small Ethiopian community on Malta . It ' s the first time she ' s seen many of her new friends since being discharged from hospital last week .They raise paper cups of soda in a toast and Shweyga bashfully takes the salute and laughs and jokes with her fellow Ethiopians .It ' s heart warming to see her finally enjoying herself . All her Ethiopian friends here had been lured to Libya by promises of lucrative work . But no one we know of has suffered quite like Shweyga .One friend Emanuel Tsegay tells me that on hearing Shweyga ' s story he burst into tears .Shweyga ' s unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi ' s daughter in law Aline has touched people around the world and resulted in some 40 , 000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery .We found Shweyga abandoned in a Gadhafi family compound in August .Lying alone on a mattress on the floor , she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body , simply because she ' d been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying .She arrived here in September and has undergone surgery and skin grafts since then .Now though , surgeons are satisfied enough with her progress to allow her to become an outpatient .She ' s staying at a small apartment on the island and is receiving some financial help from the Qatari government , which has helped bankroll the Libyan revolution and arm its fighters .Shweyga ' s life here is not ideal though . She yearns to see her family , but red tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to Malta .Shweyga says she doesn ' t feel ready physically or emotionally to return to Ethiopia and be subjected to the scrutiny of people in her hometown . She remains profoundly self conscious of her appearance .But the doctors and nurses treating her at the Mater Dei hospital are pleased with her recovery .Nurse Mary Rose Bonnici has been treating her since she arrived . We watched as she delicately trimmed the growing crown of hair on her scalp . It ' s growing back fast but for now it must be kept short , in order to prevent infection .Nurse Bonnici says : " She is making very good progress . It was discharging before now it ' s getting drier and drier . But now it ' s good , very good , she feels it ' s good anyway . "The consultant in charge of her case , Francis Xavier Dermanin , says : " Ms . Mullah had regular physiotherapy for mobilization of her limbs especially the right shoulder which showed signs of early contractures due to immobility from the burns that she had sustained ." She also had the support of our psychologists in helping her to get over the horrific trauma that she had sustained . In both aspects she did very well ." In general , Ms . Mullah is more confident and communicating well with the medical and nursing staff . "It ' s encouraging that her hair is growing back in places on her head . But the hair follicles towards the front , where the skin graft was performed , seem to have been permanently killed off .The doctors hope there are enough towards the back to enable her to grow her hair out and disguise the scars .I ask Shweyga about Aline Gadhafi and she speaks rapidly and with conviction .She hopes the former dictator ' s daughter in law will one day be caught and prosecuted . But like her husband Hannibal Gadhafi , Aline ' s whereabouts remains unknown . Victims like Shweyga are still waiting for justice . 	 0

Today Microsoft has published its financial results for the company ' s Q2 of fiscal year 2016 . Excluding certain items , the company reported income of 6 . 3 billion , or 78 cents per share , on adjusted revenue of 25 . 7 billion .Analysts on average had expected a profit of 71 cents USA per share and revenue of US 25 . 26 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I B E S .Microsoft ' s fastest growing business is helping offset ongoing weakness in Windows sales .The tech giant ' s quarterly report is due out Thursday after the close .Microsoft generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States .Azure revenue grew 140 percent . While the recent INTC print didn ' t alter our ( already conservative ) Windows OEM revs estimates , INTC ' s deceleration in server chip ( Data Center ) revs growth reinforced our view that on premise IT infrastructure spending remains under pressure .2014 : 5 . 8 billion 2015 : 6 . 3 billion , up 8 . Though Windows 10 for PC is slowly gaining market share , the same hasn ' t been true for Windows 10 mobile .Productivity and Business Processes , which includes Office 365 , declined 2 percent in revenue , in line with guidance .The company ' s latest operating system software , Windows 10 , released at the end of July , is now running on more than 200 million devices and outpacing the previous version ' s adoption by nearly 400 percent , the company said earlier this month .On the flip side , Microsoft ' s phone division is tanking . All three performed fairly well in the December quarter .Microsoft sold more Xbox Ones but fewer Xbox 360s , and the Xbox Ones were sold at a lower price than before .The number of people using Xbox Live online service for digital content and video game play climbed 30 percent to a record high 48 million . Phone revenue as a whole declined 53 percent , or 1 . 2 billion .Otherwise , Nadella says he ' s focused on offsetting the shrinking market by continuing Windows 10 itself more enterprise friendly with new security and compliance features , which will encourage more of the crucial business market to take the plunge and upgrade . But Microsoft ' s woes in the smartphone space are well known : a shortage of third party apps , plus a Windows 10 Mobile operating system seemingly designed for the small , loyal cadre of existing Windows enthusiasts .In total , Microsoft ' s tablet shipments increased almost 50 a year ago , which is a remarkable swing against the general trend . 	 0

Most people fear monster waves but not Western Australian quadriplegic Paul D ' Vorak despite having no movement below his armpits .The risks of taking on the wild surf doesn ' t worry the 41 year old former champion surfer who uses a specially designed board .Before his first surf at the bombie behind the Gallows break near Margaret River , others wanted to call it off due to the wind .But not D ' Vorak who used his shoulders to take off on the first wave when he found himself in a spot of trouble .Paul D ' Vorak pictured being attached to his specially designed surf boardFearless : D ' Vorak being towed out to catch the next wave' I was stranded in the impact zone and copped a set on the head and got bounced off the reef and washed all the way to the beach , ' he told the ABC .However , this did not deter D ' Vorak one bit .' I actually enjoyed the wipe outs as much as I enjoyed catching the wave because there are a lot of sensations that I thought I ' d never experience again , ' he said .' The first one hit me and pushed me for about 10 metres before it let me come up , he said .' The second one actually bounced me off the reef and rolled me on the bottom , and it was great to experience all those sensations and feelings again .

Dan Ashworth thinks Harry Kane will become an even better striker if he plays for England at the European Under 21 Championship this summer .Two years ago Kane was going through a miserable loan spell at Norwich , but given his recent form , it would not be a surprise if he scored the winner for Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday .Kane has scored 24 goals for Spurs this term and is almost certain to earn his first senior England call up in three weeks ' time .Harry Kane strikes a penalty against West Ham , which led to his 14th Premier League goal of the seasonKane ' s excellent form , including two goals against Chelsea , makes it likely he will get an England call upThis June England ' s youngsters travel to the Czech Republic for the Under 21 championships .Seniors manager Roy Hodgson has told Under 21 coach Gareth Southgate he can pick any eligible senior player and Ashworth thinks Kane would profit from the experience of playing in the youth tournament even though he is likely to be a full international by then .' It ' s the best eight teams in Europe , and it ' s the next big international tournament to a senior one , ' said FA technical director Ashworth .' There are pressures , there are challenges of international football that can ' t always be replicated in club football and it ' s the nearest thing he ' s going to get to hopefully going on and winning something for England seniors as well . It would be immensely beneficial for him and any other player going .There are concerns about over playing Kane , who was rested for Thursday ' s Europa League defeatKane has already played 10 times for the under 21 side , and will be eligible for the European championshipsKane has scored eight times for Gareth Southgate ' s side , and Dan Ashworth wants him to stick with them' I ' m sure Gareth would love to have him going with the 21s . 'Kane has been a regular in Southgate ' s team since he took over from Stuart Pearce as Young Lions coach .Pearce left his post after guiding the team through a dismal Euros two years ago .England lost all three group stage matches and failed to score from open play .Ashworth is optimistic about the team ' s chances of success this time around though , thanks partly to Kane ' s form and that of Saido Berahino , who topped the scoring charts in qualifying with 10 goals in 10 appearances .The likes of Raheem Sterling ( left ) and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain are also eligible for the young lionsSeveral senior players like Luke Shaw , Ross Barkley , Raheem Sterling , Jack Wilshere , Alex Oxlade Chamberlain , Calum Chambers and Phil Jones are also eligible for selection , but Ashworth concedes Southgate will have to take a pragmatic approach to squad selection .' It ' s our duty as a national association to try and get our best players and most appropriate players to go to every single tournament , ' said Ashworth , who was West Brom technical director before joining the Football Association .' We want to win it . That ' s important to me and it ' s important to us .' That ' s not necessarily at the expense of ruining a relationship with a club or a player that ' s played consecutively for three successive seasons and has never had a summer break . ' 	 0

One day I would like to go there and test myself but I want to establish myself in Super League first . Maybe in a few years ' time . 'Clark capped a memorable season for his club by scooping the major honours at the Man of Steel awards dinner at Old Trafford cricket club , where his boss Daryl Powell was named coach of the year .It was a fitting way for him to bow out of his home town club but , before he can link up with Warrington as the replacement for Michael Monaghan , Clark will face a new challenge on the international stage .He was always likely to go on tour after his stellar domestic season but is set to be England ' s first choice hooker following the withdrawal of James Roby .Daryl Powell ( left ) was named Coach of the Year and Clark was Young Player of the Year and Man of SteelThe St Helens hooker , who wants to give his injured ankles time to fully recover in the off season , was on the Man of Steel short list , along with prop forwards Jamie Peacock ( Leeds ) and Chris Hill ( Warrington ) , but took time out at the awards night to wish his successor well .' He wished me luck and said he hopes we go over there and play well , ' Clark said . ' They are big shoes to fill . He ' s been outstanding for a few years .' I ' m just looking to go there and enjoy it . It ' s something new for me , I ' ve never been involved with the England set up .' It ' s going to be tough but that ' s what you want to do , test yourself against the best players in your position to see where you stand .

' That ' s good for us . It ' s difficult , when only one striker available . It is difficult . When you have two , obviously the situation improves .' We don ' t have Mikel , it ' s not good for us . He ' s always an option . But the fact we recover Ramires is a compensation for that loss . So the situation is a bit better . 'And Mourinho insisted that the striker would continue to be allowed to go on international duty , despite his injury problems .Mourinho has been rowing with Spain national team coach Vicente del Bosque in recent weeks .The Portuguese was not happy that Costa came back from international duty injured but del Bosque has hit back saying he will remain stubborn by playing the striker .Mourinho , however , will not stand in his Costa ' s way of joining up with the Spain team in future .He added : ' The only thing I can say is what everybody knows , which is the time he was having problems in Chelsea and the way we managed to keep him playing , but after the national team we lost him for four matches .

The deadly attack on the U . S . diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , was " likely preventable " based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings that the security situation there was deteriorating , the majority of the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in a report released on Wednesday .Separately , the findings also noted what the FBI had told the panel that 15 people cooperating with its investigation had been killed in Benghazi , undercutting the investigation . It was not clear if the killings were related to the probe .Moreover , it said that people linked with various al Qaeda related groups in North Africa and elsewhere participated in the September 11 , 2012 , attack , but investigators haven ' t been able to determine whether any one group was in command .The report placed some blame for the outcome on the State Department , saying it should have " increased its security posture more significantly " in Libya ' s second largest city because of general warnings that U . S . personnel were at risk .The intelligence community " provided ample strategic warning " that Americans and U . S . facilities were in danger , though it didn ' t offer a single warning that would have predicted the Benghazi attack that killed U . S . Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans , the report said .But the findings didn ' t spare the intelligence community , saying it might have flagged potential threats to the compound had it done more analysis of " extremist affiliated social media . "It also blasted U . S . intelligence for inaccurately reporting without " sufficient intelligence to corroborate it " that a protest might have led to the attack .The report said the intelligence community took too long to correct the erroneous reports , " which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers . "The Obama administration initially believed the armed assault was triggered by outrage over a U . S . produced anti Muslim film . It has since classified it as an organized terror attack .Investigators haven ' t found evidence of pre planning and suggest at least part of the attack was " opportunistic . "That suggests a vulnerability for diplomatic facilities , because attacks can happen with little warning , the report said .Questions around security and intelligence as well as the slow to evolve and changing explanation fueled a ferocious response from Republicans in Congress , who have sharply criticized the administration and continue to investigate .New York Times report casts doubt on al Qaeda involvement in BenghaziA State Department spokeswoman , Marie Harf , said the report largely affirms the findings of an independent review of the Benghazi matter that recommended steps since undertaken by the agency to improve security at diplomatic facilities worldwide .On the issue of whether the attacks were preventable , Harf noted that " we have repeatedly said there was no specific threat " pointing to an attack ." Obviously , we ' ve talked at length about the fact that we knew there were extremists and terrorists operating in Libya and in Benghazi . But , again , we had no specific information indicating a threat an attack was coming , " she said .The Intelligence Committee report follows the release on Monday of previously classified information by the House Armed Services Committee .According to the documents , senior military officials told the panel there were no discussions related to any specific threat in Libya despite general warnings about the possibility of terror attacks around the anniversary of 9 11 . As a result , additional military assets were not deployed to the area .On the investigation , the FBI was quoted in the report as saying the 15 deaths have severely hampered its probe ." The FBI ' s investigation into the individuals responsible for the Benghazi attacks has been hampered by inadequate cooperation and a lack of capacity by foreign governments to hold these perpetrators accountable , making the pursuit of justice for the attacks slow and insufficient , " the report said ." As a result , key information gaps remain about the potential foreknowledge and complicity of Libyan militia groups and security forces , the level of pre planning for the attacks , the perpetrators and their involvement in other terrorist activities and the motivation for the attacks . "Several Intelligence Committee Republicans issued a separate set of conclusions .Committee Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , Richard Burr of North Carolina , Marco Rubio of Florida , Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , and Dan Coats of Indiana said failures that led to the attack could be partly related to Obama ' s failure , in their words , to establish a clear detention policy for terror suspects that gets the most out of intelligence collection .Instead of sending terror suspects directly to the military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , the administration has temporarily interrogated suspects on Navy ships , sometimes for weeks at a time , before sending them to the United States for trial ." President Obama and his administration must end their efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and must develop a clear , cogent policy for the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists , " the Senators wrote .GOP Rep : Benghazi not a ' complete cover up ' 	 0
In a conversation inside the Big Brother house on Channel 5 , Edward , from Jedward , has candidly admitted to the other house mates that he wants to have a sex change . This was news to his brother ." Jedward are going to Thailand , " said Edward , after a task involving hooking ducks out of a barrel . " We always thought we could make it big there . While we ' re there , though , I ' m going for the op . "And by the op , Edward doesn ' t mean having his tonsils removed . Although music lovers everywhere would enjoy that particular operation , and would possibly volunteer to perform the procedure ." I was born into the wrong body , " he admitted . " I should have been a girl called Brenda . "After the operation , Jedward will be renamed Jenda .According to the twins mother , Edward had confided in her about his desire to become her daughter , rather than her hugely effeminate son ." He ' s always wanted to be a girl , " she said . " Ever since I glued false breasts on him when he was three so he would win Miss Butlins . "John has no such desires , but fully supports his brother ." I will stand with you , " John said , publicly hugging his soon to be sister .Edward had taken a range of his usual clothing into the house , but has made a request via the diary chair that his clothes are replaced so that he can live full time as a woman ." Ordinarily , " said Hugh Frere , program co ordinate , " we wouldn ' t allow for additional items to be taken into the house . What you take with you is what you have with you . However , we think having Edward prancing around dressed as a drag queen is going to be hilarious television , so we ' re going to allow it . " 	 1

london, england sales of the flu drug relenza shot up 1, 900 percent from a year ago as governments around the world stockpiled in preparation for a swine flu pandemic, drugmaker glaxosmithkline said wednesday. stocks of antiviral treatments are pictured at a warehouse in an undisclosed location in the ukrelenza sales were 60 million ( 98. 4 million ) in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3 million ( 4. 9 million ) in the same quarter last year, the company said in announcing its q2 results. glaxo also said that by the end of the year, it expects to have an annual production capacity for relenza of 190 million treatment courses, more than a threefold increase to its previously announced maximum capacity. the company will achieve it by increasing production of the relenza diskhaler inhaler and building new capacity to manufacture relenza rotacaps, glaxo said. watch as swine flu boosts drug profitsrelenza is an antiviral medication similar to tamiflu that treats symptoms of the flu and helps to prevent getting it. glaxosmithkline started production last month of a vaccine for swine flu, also known as the h1n1 virus, the company said. it is now on track to meet the orders placed by many governments and the world health organization for the vaccine, glaxo said. " to date we have contracts in place to supply 195 million doses of the vaccine, " chief executive andrew witty said. " we also have a variety of agreements in place with the u. s. government to supply pandemic products worth 250 million. discussions with over 50 governments are ongoing, with many at advanced stages, and i therefore expect further significant orders. shipments are expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010. " however, he thinks any sales boost from the planned swine flu vaccine will last only as long as the threat. " what we're doing here is responding to government needs, where they've said, look, we don't know how serious this is going to be but we want to be prepared ', " he said. the real challenge for pharmaceutical companies is coming up with new blockbuster drugs for chronic disease, not acute outbreaks like swine flu. " i think what you see in our industry is relatively resistant to the economic downdrafts... but we do need to constantly renew our portfolio that's the challenge we face. " glaxo will donate supplies of both the swine flu vaccine and relenza to the who for use in developing countries, he said. australian company csl announced this week it planned to start the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine in australia. watch vaccine being testedparticipants will receive two shots three weeks apart and will undergo blood tests to determine if they are generating an appropriate immune response to the virus, the company said. swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the who said monday it was changing tactics against the virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. who declared the virus a global pandemic on june 11. more than 120 countries have reported cases of human infection, totaling more than 98, 000 documented cases worldwide. more than 700 people have died of the virus, the organization said tuesday. with 29 deaths and a huge rise in the number of cases, britain has the worst swine flu figures in europe. cases of swine flu in britain have, however, proven to be generally mild in most people, prime minister gordon brown said wednesday. they have been severe only among a small minority, mostly where patients have had underlying health problems, he said. " robust plans are in place " to deal with the pandemic, brown said. by the end of the week, a new national pandemic flu service will be operating in england to quickly diagnose people who have swine flu and allow them to get antiviral treatment directly from local providers, brown said. swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the who is changing tactics against the h1n1 virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. " at this point, further spread of the pandemic, within affected countries and to new countries, is considered inevitable, " the who said. the counting of all cases is no longer essential because it is exhausting countries'resources, the organization said. while most patients have reported mild symptoms, a rise in severe symptoms or respiratory ailments that require hospitalization should be cause for concern, it said. governments should also pay attention to unusual patterns linked to fatal cases, the who said. any changes in prevailing patterns should be flagged, including a rise in school and job absenteeism, and an increase in visits 	 0
The owners of all patents ever issued have each been served with a court order today , informing them that they face legal action unless they agree to compensate Microsoft , who claim to have patented the ' patent ' in 1620 .A Microsoft spokesman said : " Quite how we were able to patent something before the concept existed , we ' re not quite sure , but since Microsoft are the rightful owners of all patents anyway , we must be right " .Rumors of a time machine being built under Bill Gate ' s mansion in an attempt to change the past have been rubbished my Microsoft who said : " If we did have a time machine , why would we have left so many bugs in Windows ? The original Microsoft ' patent ' patent has a clear , un arguable place in history . "The Microsoft patent traces its routes back to the point in 1620 when a group of Microsoft representatives on board the Mayflower actually founded what is now America . Microsoft claims that even older ' prior art ' would be available from the 16th century had Microsoft ' s Access Database software been available at the time to record the events more accurately .Bill Gates was quoted as saying : " Everyone knows that Microsoft developed the first user friendly graphics driven working environment for the PC , just as everyone knows we invented sliced bread , the wheel , electricity , the combustion engine . . . ( list continues for 3 more hours ) "The law suits could have a potentially deadly affect on the American economy , as virtually every company in existence uses something which has been patented at some point or another .One potential outcome is that the US government simply hands over control to Bill Gates , and foregoes the whole ' presidential election drama ' in an attempt to stabilize the economy . This , say analysts , would have dire consequences . Without a religious fundamentalist or a war veteran in charge , the country could prosper through warmer international relations and greater software compatibility .While it will take years , probably decades to sort through the patents and figure out who owes what , Microsoft say that they expect to have the matter all wrapped up well before the planned shipping date of Longhorn , the next Windows operating system . 	 1

london, england the " crime scene cookies ", " baaji custard " and " sponge shafts " depicted in oliver beale's letter of complaint to virgin atlantic struck a chord worldwide. mean cuisine? airline industry experts insist standards of in flight food are improving. the missive he sent to virgin chairman sir richard branson about a meal he received on board a virgin flight from mumbai to london in december spread across the web and email with a vengeance. not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long haul air travel : the in flight meal. read the letter here. " food gets everybody going, whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane, " says peter miller, marketing director at skytrax, a uk based aviation research organization. " apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry, it is there to alleviate the boredom. because of that people tend to focus on it more. " but the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, miller argues. skytrax has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy, business and first class. miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long haul economy. but skytrax's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years. " we are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world, " says miller. standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says miller. what do you think? are in flight meals getting better or worse? what was your worse meal? sound off below. austrian catering company do co has transformed the food served onboard austrian airlines and turkish airlines flights. skytrax reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for turkish airlines since do co was hired in 2007. " in the last 15 20 years, the industry has focused on lean production. but we believe airline catering is not the job of a car manufacturer, " says attila dogudan, ceo of do co. good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine. " if you have chefs doing 3, 000 filets on the grill, after 300 they lose the passion, " says dogudan. to inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, do co says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes. they say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh, local ingredients come from. airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers. austrian airlines has won the skytrax award for best business class catering for the last two years. as michael braun, spokesman at austrian airlines says, " the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut. but the competition is also very tough, so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines. " and for austrian airlines, one unique selling point is its food. there is an on board chef on every austrian airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium class meals. the airline also offers a " vienna coffee house in the air " and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list. airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts. british chef, gordon ramsay is one of singapore airline's " culinary panel " juan amador works with lufthansa and united airlines enlisted the services of u. s. chef charlie trotter to inspire its in flight menu. chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude. as michelle bernstein, delta's celebrity chef has said, palates weaken in pressurized air cabins, which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground. miller at skytrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering. after all, gordon ramsay isn't actually in the cabin saut ing the potatoes. but he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in flight cuisine. chef neil perry, hired by qantas in 2003, initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class. his work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes. qantas won the skytrax award for best economy class catering in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self serve bar in economy on its a380 aircraft. but as airlines grapple with a deepening recession, can passengers expect treats to vanish from food 	 0
Amazon , the online all in one , uber efficient retailer has long been a pioneer in online retailing . Now they have gone one step further by allowing people to search their product base ordered not just by price or popularity , but also by colour ." Say you ' re looking for a sofa , " said head of online development , Rita Taylor . " You can already search for blue , but with the new ordering scheme , you can quickly nip through the colours and see close to blue colours as well as blue . Purple or green go quite nicely with blue . You can mix and match the ordering as well , so price within colour , for instance . "It is not just clothes and furniture than can be ordered by colour . Everything on the site can be ordered by colour ." It ' s quite nice to order music or books by colour , " said Taylor . " Seeing the kaleidoscopic array of albums or book covers is a pleasing effect . "Amazon have also made it possible to arrange across category by colour , so that those people who want a coffee table book that blends with their sofa and coffee table , or who only want albums that fit with a yellow colour scheme , can quickly and easily locate books and music that fit the criteria ." Lets face it , " said Taylor . " Just about everybody has dozens and dozens of CDs that they have no intention of listening to . And probably twice that ambiguous number in books they have no intention of reading . This new scheme at least makes them match with the decor . "Some album art have multiple colours on them , and these appear in multicoloured and each of the colour on the sleeve . Which for something like Mika ' s albums , is every colour ." Some people won ' t find it that useful , " admitted Taylor . " But they ' ll probably use it anyway , because it can look beautiful , and everybody loves art . " 	 1
the united states and great britain have pulled their last forces out of strife torn yemen, raising fears that the failed state will become even more of a breeding ground for terror groups plaguing the middle east and the west. over the weekend, the united states evacuated the last of its special operations forces including navy seals and army delta force troops amid the deteriorating security situation in the country, the u. s. state department said. the u. s. move came a day after terrorists bombed two mosques in the capital, sanaa, on friday, killing at least 137 and wounding 357 others, according to yemen's state run saba news agency. the terror group isis, based in syria, claimed responsibility for the attack. it also followed months of fighting between government forces and houthi rebels, who on sunday seized the international airport in taiz. the rebels now control both the airport and sanaa. yemen has been a key u. s. ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula, allowing u. s. drones and special operations forces to stalk terrorists in the country. now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the middle eastern nation. while state department spokesman jeff rathke said saturday that the united states would continue to " take action to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the united states and our citizens, " the move left some wondering what role the u. s. could play with no forces on the ground. the country closed its embassy in sanaa last month. " i don't think there is an active role for the u. s. other than intelligence and trying to see where the dust is going to settle, " said u. s. sen. angus king, a maine independent who serves on the senate armed services and intelligence committees. that raises the possibility of the already unstable country becoming an even more fertile environment for terror groups to collaborate, grow and export violence, according to robin wright, a security and defense analyst with the woodrow wilson center. " it's becoming much like syria, much like afghanistan was at the peak of its instability, " she said. on sunday, u. n. officials said the country appeared to be on a " rapid downward spiral. " the security council again deplored the violence and called for an end to the fighting and for houthi rebels to return government facilities to the elected government of president abdo rabbo mansour hadi. but officials said recent events " seemed to be leading the country further away from a peaceful settlement and towards the edge of civil war. " in addition to counterterrorism issues, all sorts of geopolitical influences are at work in yemen chief among them the regional power play between regional rivals iran and saudi arabia. " they believe now that iran is in control in beirut, in damascus, in baghdad and now on their southern border in yemen, " francona said. " so the saudis are beginning to feel a little threatened here and are hoping the yemen situation doesn't spiral out of control. " the saudis and other gulf arab nations have called for every effort to be made to roll back the houthi gains and hand full control back to hadi's government. on monday, houthi leader abdul malik al houthi criticized regional governments over their stance on the fighting. al houthi said his group was striking back at al qaeda and isis in self defense, and said he found it " very strange " that nearby governments would condemn the group for such acts while welcoming the united states, which he called " the umbrella of tyranny in the world. " yemen : what you need to know about how we got herethere's little reason to believe the security council's calls for peace will have much impact. last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest, with little effect on the fighting. last week, a yemeni jet commanded by the houthi fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden. no one was injured, but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. that same day, yemeni military forces some under the houthis, others led by officers loyal to hadi battled in aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, aden gov. abdul aziz hobtour said. the fighting is taking a huge toll on yemen's people and economy, said rafat al akhali, the country's former youth minister. aside from the direct impact of fighting, people are losing jobs and businesses are closing, he said. there's still time, he said, to implement a political solution to the crisis. " i don't think we're past the point of no return yet, " he said. francona was less sanguine. " i don't see anything 	 0

Germans have voted British Dyson vacuum cleaners as better than anything Germans can make themselvesBritish Dyson vacuum cleaners are better than anything German firms make say the Germans themselves .The company founded by Sir James Dyson , who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bag , came top in a study of consumers by Germany ' s Institute for Quality .German families rated Dyson above their own Miele , Vorwerk , Siemens , AEG , Bosch and Karcher .It is a rare example of a British manufacturer still run by its founder that is not only doing rather well in this country , but has carried the flag for innovation and quality around the world .Indeed , Dyson cleaners are also the market leader in the home of technology , Japan , in terms of the value and volume of sales .They are also number one in terms of value in Taiwan and Hong Kong , while it is reporting strong growth in China , where companies have a reputation for ripping off successful ideas and creating their own cheaper versions .The study ' s findings were welcomed by Dyson ' s German chief executive , Max Conze , who said : ' German consumers rate us ahead of their home grown companies , like Bosch and Miele .' It disproves the common thinking that only Germans can manufacture world class technology . Interestingly we are seeing a similar pattern in Japan , where we are now number one , overtaking home grown successes in their own back yard .' It seems we are ' out Germaning the Germans ! ' . 'Dyson ' s prowess means it has become a magnet for graduates and engineers , creating thousands of jobs in highly skilled jobs in this country , while its machines are made in Malaysia .Today 22 years after it got rid of the bag it is unveiling its latest improved vacuum cleaner the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball .The big change is that having done away with the bag , the new cleaner has now removed the need for a filter that in other machines can become clogged and needs to be cleaned or replaced .On most existing so called cyclone machines the filter is needed to hold the finest particles of dust that are sucked up to prevent them clogging up the tubes .However , the Dyson team found that if they created flexible tips on the tubes which funnel the dust into the machine , they vibrate so quickly that the tiny particles cannot block them .The company was founded by Sir James Dyson , pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron , who reinvented the vacuum cleaner by doing away with the bagThe flexible tips , which it calls Cinetic , vibrate 350 times a second which means dust as small as 0 . 5 microns , which is smaller than a skin cell , are spun through the machine and into the collecting bin .Sir James said : ' Removing the bag from a vacuum solved one hassle , but filter maintenance remained an annoying problem that needed fixing .' Dyson engineers have spent six years perfecting cyclone technology to make filter maintenance obsolete .' The constant flexing of Cinetic tips ensures the cyclones do not block as microscopic dust is spun out of the air not trapped in a cyclone or on a filter . 'The technology is the result of nearly six years intensive research and development by a team of 29 Dyson engineers . Some 2 , 000 prototypes were developed whilst creating the new technology .The company said the removal of the need for a filter , which can become clogged , means the machine remains a constant high level of suction , so removing dirt and dust particles that can trigger allergies .Its new Dyson Cinetic Big Ball machine is available from its website with a price tag of 459 . 99 . 	 0
A stockbroker who crashed a 250 , 000 super car was pulled from the burning wreckage by the salesman giving him a test drive .The driver , who has not been named , lost control of the McLaren 650S and smashed it into a tree .As the vehicle burst into flames , salesman Lee Christian managed to clamber out but he was initially unable to free the unconscious driver .One of the firefighters saidit had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodiesIt was only seconds before the fuel tank exploded completely destroying the 200mph car that he pulled him clear .The stockbroker was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he was treated for fractures to a shoulder , elbow and ankle . He is still recovering from a series of skin grafts .Mr Christian , who suffered cuts and burns , was back at work at the McLaren dealership in Knutsford , Cheshire , within four weeks .Father of two Lee Christian , 37 , sustained a nasty cut to the back of his head and burns to his face and headThe father of two said : ' After we impacted with the tree , my first thought was that I was OK . But when I looked across , the driver looked in a very bad way .' The impact had ripped off the driver ' s door and there were flames in the back of the car .' I tried to make my escape through the passenger door but that was jammed , so I had to clamber over the driver .' The fire was so intense that it was difficult to get to him and on the third attempt I knew it was going to be now or never .' I managed to grab him by his trouser belt and by an arm and with my feet against the vehicle managed to pull him out .' I then managed to carry him 30 metres into the field with the car behind me banging and exploding .' Passers by used the detached driver ' s door to shield him from the intensity of the blaze . 'Mr Christian has been honoured with a bravery award from Cheshire Constabulary .Chief Constable Simon Byrne said : ' It was a selfless act in an extremely perilous scenario that put Lee ' s own life at risk . His actions are very much deserving of this commendation . 'The incident took place on a country road near High Legh , around four miles from the McLaren dealership .Mr Christian said he had had two ' very nice ' letters from the driver ' s wife in which she said without his actions her husband would not be alive .A firefighters said it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodiesIn the weeks following the crash Mr Christian also went to thank the firefighters from Stockton Heath who had attended on the dayHe added : ' One of the firefighters told me it had been the single biggest accident he had attended where the crew did not have to remove bodies .' That just shows how lucky we both were on that day . 'Last year , a McLaren worker died in hospital after he crashed a 650S on his way back to the Formula 1 team ' s headquarters in Woking , Surrey . 	 0
Do you really turn off your smartphone , tablet or computer before takeoff and landing ?Despite flight attendants telling passengers to power off , some people admit they don ' t always shut down their devices .Nearly one third of passengers say they have accidentally forgotten to turn off their smartphones and other electronic devices in flight , according to this week ' s joint study by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and Consumer Electronics Association .While more than 90 agree those flight attendant directions to turn off devices are clear , 59 say they always turn their devices completely off and 21 say they switch their devices to " airplane mode . " Some 5 say they sometimes completely shut down their devices .Many travelers also admit they don ' t actually understand when they can use those devices . More than 40 wrongly believe they can use devices while taxiing to the runway , more than 30 in the air before reaching 10 , 000 feet and 26 on a flight ' s final descent .Almost every adult passenger who travels with portable electronic devices carried at least one such device on board , and nearly two thirds used them in flight , the study found .Debate continues over electronic gadgets on planes" Airline passengers have come to rely on their smartphones , tablets and e readers as essential travel companions , " said Doug Johnson , vice president of technology policy at the Consumer Electronics Association , in a statement . " Understanding the attitudes and behaviors of passengers that are using electronic devices while traveling will help the FAA make informed decisions . "The study results were shared with the Federal Aviation Administration , according to an Airline Passenger Experience Association website posting . An FAA representative declined to comment on the study results .Hints of how the FAA might change the current rules regarding electronics in the air may come as soon as this summer . The FAA set up a working group in August to study the issue of portable electronics on flights and make suggestions for changes ." The Aviation Rulemaking Committee continues to have regular meetings and teleconferences , " said an FAA representative via e mail . " We expect their report and recommendations shortly after the group finishes its work at the end of July . "Both the FAA and Federal Communications Commission regulate electronics in the air .The FCC forbids the use of mobile phones using the 800 MHz frequency and other wireless devices on aircraft in flight because of " potential interference to wireless networks on the ground . " The FAA supports that in flight restriction but does allow the use of cell phones while the plane is on the ground , at the gate or waiting for a gate but not when the aircraft is taxiing for takeoff .The FAA bans the use of wireless devices during flight because of " potential interference to the aircraft ' s navigation and communication systems . " The FAA allows use of some non transmitting electronic devices outside of critical phases of flight such as takeoff and landing . During those noncritical phases of flight , the airlines set their own policies regarding passenger use of non transmitting electronic devices .What do you think of the current restrictions on electronic devices on planes ?

It was supposed to be a girls ' night in , with two young mothers watching television and enjoying a drink .But the evening spiralled out of control when Jessica Ward and Molly Couch binged on three bottles of wine and ended up brawling in the street .The fight began after they locked themselves out leaving their two baby daughters alone inside .Friends Molly Couch ( left ) and Jessica Ward ( right ) had drunk three bottles of wine before leaving their childrenPolice were called to the house of 22 year old Ward and found her and Couch , 21 , drunkenly blaming each other , swearing and throwing their arms around .

NEW HAVEN , CT Road oncologists at Yale New Haven Hospital held a press conference Tuesday to announce that Interstate 95 , the main conduit running along the country ' s Eastern Seaboard , had begun treatment for stage III highway cancer , an advanced and often terminal form of the disease .According to doctors , the 1 , 900 mile roadway , which had been battling illness since late September , was diagnosed after Connecticut motorists reported having to stop for a strange , previously unseen bump , later determined to be an 8 mile long tumor lodged in its southbound shoulder ." When we analyzed the asphalt biopsy , all of our worst suspicions were confirmed classic case of late stage highway cancer , " said Dr Angela Everett , the 15 state thoroughfare ' s primary physician . " But since the tumor was too large to dig out with a backhoe , we elected to try an aggressive combination of freeway radiation and expressway chemotherapy . "" Now , of course with any interstate cancer there is no guarantee of survival , but I promise we ' re doing everything we possibly can , " Everett continued , urging drivers to be patient with the road ' s increasingly faint signage , slower speeds , and deep potholes where IV drips have been attached .Since beginning treatment , I 95 has reportedly undergone a rapid physical transformation , most visibly a drop from eight lanes to two . Commuters have also noticed the steady disappearance of roadside foliage , a byproduct of the powerful drugs coursing through its metropolitan arteries .However , while supporters expect the vast transit network to put up a strong fight , the prognosis is not optimistic . With the exception of notable successes like California ' s I 405 which celebrates 10 years in remission this December Department of Transportation figures show that highway cancer is by far the nation ' s biggest turnpike killer , claiming an estimated 200 toll roads a year ." It breaks my heart because I know that 95 wants to be out there doing what it loves : taking people from point A to point B between Florida and Maine , " said DOT secretary Ray LaHood , who added that he had become close friends with the road since taking office in 2009 . " I feel partially responsible , too , because if I had stayed on its case about getting regular screenings we probably could have caught this thing earlier . "" I just can ' t imagine a world without I 95 and everything it brings to America ' s transportation system , " continued LaHood , echoing the sentiments of the hundreds of bridges and overpasses that have vowed to stay by its side " until the end . "Upon hearing the news of the highway ' s diagnosis , regular I 95 commuters expressed shock that such a serious disease could befall the normally vibrant and well maintained road ." All of this is kind of hard to swallow , I mean . I just drove on 95 yesterday and it looked totally fine , " said 43 year old event planner Henry Fitzsimmons . " Just goes to show how incredibly fragile infrastructure can be . It ' s times like this that make you pull over and appreciate every precious moment you have . "" I just hope it stays brave and gets the care it needs so it can return to its old self as soon as possible , " he added .At press time , state lawmakers were in the process of requesting emergency funding from the federal government , as the expensive highway cancer treatments are not covered by I 95 ' s health insurance . 	 1
there's a lot of jive about the so called grudge between tupac and biggie, but this storm in a teacup pales in comparison to the biggest, baddest rap grudge in history. check it. kanye west recently had these well meaning but uncomplimentary words for his fellow bad ass mother, l l cool j : " ok, so they're saying i hate l l cool j, that i think he's a pussy. that's real harsh, man! you know, i actually kinda respect this bitch, know what i'm sayin '?

A company representative for a Research Firm that needed some door to door work got a volunteer who told them that he needed some exercise anyway and so he volunteered .After three doors being shut in his face , a lady in her late 20s came to the door with two children hanging onto her dress and looking up at the representative ." Mam , I work for a Research Firm that represents Vaseline . Have you used the product ? "" Oh sure . We have used vaseline ever since we have been married . There might only be one child instead of three . . . one ' s at school , without vaseline . "" Then you don ' t mind me asking a few more questions do you ? "" Nope . "Well , what do you use vaseline for the most ? "" Sex ! "A little red faced , the rep . smiled . " Thank you for your honesty . Most people would say they used it on rough elbows , kids bike chains and other jobs needed . Why don ' t you use KY Jelly ? Most people do . "" It comes off too easy . "" Oh . Another new answer . So you use the vaseline you know where ? "" You mean the doorknob ? Yes . the little guys can ' t turn the doorknob . Though the oldest called 911 one time . Thought we were fighting I was grunting so loud . Ky Jelly . . . they just wiped that off and caught us playing ' scissors ' again . We tell them that and that we want to be left alone to play just as they do . " 	 1
A new debate has broken out between some of the world ' s top Shakespeare experts over whether the playwright ' s sonnets prove he was attracted to men .Sir Brian Vickers , a visiting professor at University College London , began the row by condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a ' primarily homosexual context ' .In a letter to the Times Literary Supplement , he said the claim was ' anachronistic ' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction .Professor Sir Brian Vickers started the debate over playwright William Shakespeare ' s ( pictured ) sexuality after condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a ' primarily homosexual context 'He also said that any attempt to find biographical information in the sonnets was doomed because Shakespeare was a professional who wrote under the identity of a ' poet persona ' .Fellow academics have since hit back at Mr Vickers ' comments , accusing him of promoting ' one of the great fallacies of modern Shakespeare criticism ' .Scholar Arthur Freeman , who described himself as a ' friendly acquaintance ' of Mr Vickers when responding to him via the letters page , accused him of introducing ' presuppositions that many of us would question , if not reject out of hand ' .He wrote : ' I cannot think of any responsible editor . . . who would dismiss the premise of homosexual , as well as heterosexual passion pervading the sonnets .' Why should Shakespeare alone be thought so committed to the " negative capability " of his dramatic craft that all his most personal writings are treated as potentially artificial ?' And even if we insist on regarding the sonnets , wholly or in part , as a kind of long term dramatic narrative . . . why on earth would Shakespeare choose so often to impersonate a pathetically ageing , balding , lame and vulnerable bisexual suitor , abjectly whingeing about rejection and betrayal unless the self humiliation that surfaces again and again through these particulars were both genuine and cathartic ? 'Love : The Bard ( Joseph Fiennes ) with his mistress Viola ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) in the 1998 blockbuster film Shakespeare in Love . When he first falls in love with her , she is dressed as a boy to act on stageThere are long standing debates over whether the poet was gay or bisexual . Pictured : The Globe TheatreAnother academic , who wrote under the name Professor Wells , also responded to the letter , pointing out that Shakespeare used at least one sonnet to woo Anne Hathaway .He said : ' When a poet whose name is William writes poems of anguished and unabashed sexual frankness which pun on the word " will " 13 times in Sonnet No 135 . . . it is not unreasonable to conclude that he may be writing from the depths of his own experience . 'Let me not to the marriage of true mindsAdmit impediments . Love is not loveWhich alters when it alteration finds ,Or bends with the remover to remove :O no it is an ever fixed mark ,That looks on tempests , and is never shaken 	 0
Serena Williams slammed Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev for his " insensitive , sexist and racist " remarks in describing her and sister Venus as the " Williams brothers " on a late night TV chat show .The world number one gave her first public reaction Sunday to Tarpischev ' s comments as she spoke to reporters on the eve of the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore .Tarpischev , who has been banned by the WTA for a year and fined 25 , 000 , has also made a public apology , but that has clearly not satisfied 18 time grand slam champion Williams ." I think the WTA did a great job of taking initiative and taking immediate action to his comments . I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time , " she said .Williams , who won the U . S . Open title last month , added : " I thought they were in a way bullying ." But the WTA and the USTA ( U . S . Tennis Association ) did a wonderful job of making sure that in this day of age , 2014 for someone with his power , it ' s really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks . "Tarpischev ' s apology , in which he suggested his remarks were a " small joke , " has also cut little ice with world number two Maria Sharapova .She has played in Russian FedCup teams captained by Tarpischev , but had little sympathy for her compatriot when asked for her reaction to the comments ." I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for , and I ' m glad that many people have stood up , including the WTA , " she said ." It was very inappropriate , especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport , but being part of the Olympic committee . It was just really irresponsible on his side . "The controversy has been an unwelcome distraction ahead of the prestigious end of season finals , where Williams is bidding for a third straight title .She opens against former world number one Ana Ivanovic Monday , hoping to shrug off injury and illness scares from her two previous tournaments in China ." I wasn ' t sure if I would be able to make it to this tournament , " she admitted ." But I ' m here , and I ' m really I feel better than I did obviously in China . I am just getting better every day hopefully . "On the men ' s ATP Tour , the race to secure a place in its eight man Tour Finals in London next month is hotting up .Britain ' s Andy Murray improved his chances of claiming one of the three remaining spots available by beating Spain ' s David Ferrer 5 7 6 2 7 5 to win the Austrian Open in Vienna .It ' s the 30th career title for Murray , who has gone above Ferrer in the standings . Both will now play in Valencia next week .Top seed Tomas Berdych also did his cause no harm by beating defending champion Grigor Dimitrov 5 7 6 4 6 4 to claim the Stockholm Open title Sunday .The Czech is now seventh , just ahead of Murray in the qualifying battle , while defeat damages the hopes of Bulgaria ' s Dimitrov , who was seeking his fourth title of the year .U . S . Open Marin Cilic , who has already booked his place at London , won the Kremlin Cup tournament , beating Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets .Tarpischev is chairman of the annual event in the Russian capital Moscow , and after his remarks about the Williams sisters , the WTA is demanding he stands down from that position . 	 0
WASHINGTON , DC In a response to recent acts of extreme violence against Americans in Iraq and mounting criticism of U . S . military policy at home , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced the government ' s new strategy of fighting terror with terror Monday ." Look , in order to catch a rat , you gotta think like one , " Rumsfeld said in a grainy and degraded videotape message filmed at an unknown location and released to CNN Monday . " We ' ve been pussy footing around the war on terrorism for years . All that time , the answer was right in front of us : In order to wipe out terror around the globe , once and for all , we ' ve gotta beat them at their own game . "" We tried playing fair , " Rumsfeld continued . " But how can you play by the rules when your opponent doesn ' t even know the rules ? You don ' t bring a knife to a gunfight . That ' s just the way it is , folks . It ' s a dog eat dog world . "On the seven minute tape , Rumsfeld is joined by counter terrorist leaders Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft , each seated on folding chairs in front of an American flag . Ashcroft described some tactics the government currently uses pre dawn assaults on civilian targets and subjecting potential stateside traitors to psychological intimidation as a " small step in the right direction . "" I can ' t really say what we have planned for the future , " Rumsfeld said . " As terrorists , fear and uncertainty will be our best weapons . Let me just say that the gloves are off . It is inevitable that indiscriminate attacks will be carried out , and innocents will lose their lives , but the end will justify the means . "Rumsfeld refused to comment on the recent abuse of military prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan , other than to characterize those abuses as " nothing compared to what we are capable of . "" It ' s vital to remember that these terrorists hate freedom , " Rumsfeld said . " Well , guess what ? From now on , we ' re going to hate it even more . Do you think terrorists care about due process and fair treatment of prisoners ? Of course not . Why should we give them the upper hand ? You fight fire with fire . "Cheney restated that the goal of the new policy is to put an end to terror around the world , once and for all ." It ' s time to get this war over with , " Cheney said . " The philosopher Eric Hoffer said , ' You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you . ' Well , we ' ve been observing , but finally we ' ve started taking notes . We ' ll have these terrorists running scared in no time . "Cheney urged Americans to " be on alert " in upcoming months ." Seneca once said , ' To be feared is to fear : No one has been able to strike terror into others and at the same time enjoy peace of mind , ' " Cheney said . " If we want these terrorists to fear the U . S . , we as a people need to be filled with fear . Expect to see more heavily armed , uniformed officers , both at home and abroad . "Elliott Abrams , Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director For Near East and North African Affairs , said that the Bush Administration acknowledged the ethical inconsistencies of its opposing terrorism through terrorism stance , but doesn ' t really care ." Look , any eighth grader knows that the line between good and evil is blurry , " Abrams said . " Our concern is the safety of the American people . An eye for an eye : Let ' s see if that plan works . "Abrams refused to provide clues about the time and method of attack , other than to allude to an " election year surprise . "" Just wait and you ' ll see , " Abrams said . " Martin Luther King said , ' Returning violence for violence multiplies violence , adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars . ' Well , enemies of democracy and freedom around the world are going to find out just how right he was . They ' ll see just how dark it can get . "Experts from the Mukhabarat el Aama Egyptian intelligence service have deemed the message authentic ." There is no doubt who the men on the tape are , " spokesman Sulieman Assad said . " Cheney can clearly be recognized from previous tapes , albeit a bit aged , and John Ashcroft is wearing his iconic stern , fanatical expression . I would recommend that the Arab world raise its security alert level to ' severe , ' but apparently , it has already been that way for some time . " 	 1
austin according to a groundbreaking report released this week by researchers at the university of texas, tens of millions of citizens across the united states are bravely resisting the relentless pressure from the media to be thin and active. the 80 page report confirmed that americans are inundated with images of slender individuals in commercials, films, television shows, print advertisements, billboards, internet ads, and product packaging every day, yet noted that as many as 190 million citizens are " courageously refusing to conform " to these media ideals of physical fitness and leanness and are instead embracing the bodies they have. " given the media's clear preference for thin physiques, we expected most americans would be actively seeking to emulate such body types, but we found that nearly 7 in 10 american adults possess the inner courage and determination to overcome the constant pressure to maintain a trim figure, " said behavioral psychologist and the report's co author olivia trumbull, noting that these americans boldly ignored, on average, 10 to 14 images of in shape individuals every minute of the day. " this level of resolve is astonishing, considering that the media is saturated with models, actors, athletes, and pop stars who are no bigger than a women's size 4 or a men's large. however, if you look around any american town or city, you'll find incredibly brave women who are size 18, size 20, even size 24, as well as brave men who routinely wear xxxl clothing. that's a testament to american willpower. " " these are regular people who, all day long, are bombarded with unrelenting messages touting the desirability of being athletic or even moderately healthy, and their response is to loudly proclaim,'no, that's not who i am,'" trumbull added. " that's the definition of courage. " the report emphasized the demographic's " incredible strength of character, " noting that such individuals were able to look past the uniformly thin celebrities that popular culture has provided for them, as well as the healthful lifestyles these media figures purvey. indeed, the report found that, rather than give in to the constant emphasis on a lean, shapely physique, the brave segment of the u. s. population consistently and valiantly avoided nutritious foods, reasonable portion sizes, and any exercise whatsoever. moreover, the study found evidence that most americans were courageously becoming heavier and significantly more sedentary in proud defiance of the media messages that are broadcast at them throughout the day. " what's most intriguing about our findings is that these stirring individuals who are standing up against hollywood studios and madison avenue advertisers are not people who have isolated themselves from popular culture rather, these are people who watch television and are on their computers all the time, " said the study's co author, dr wesley steigman. " it appears that no matter how much the media glamorizes moving around, eating only three meals a day, or just generally treating one's body with respect and concern for one's future well being, most americans staunchly refuse to let these messages affect them. the fortitude and strength it must take to do this is truly inspiring. " although researchers identified such heroic members of society in every region of the country, they noted that the greatest levels of courage were found in low income communities, particularly in the south and midwest. additionally, the report also drew attention to the " immense levels of bravery " among the nation's children, many of whom were found to be rebelling against thin, healthy media stereotypes by embracing extremely large body types as early as two years of age. while focusing mainly on body image, the report also briefly highlighted americans'remarkable bravery at withstanding other forms of media pressure, noting that millions of citizens were boldly rejecting messages to be educated, hardworking, and to maintain basic hygiene as well. " when i look around and see thin, healthy people on every magazine cover and tv screen, it's hard not to think that maybe i should alter my appearance to try to be more like them, " said research participant and type 2 diabetic henry dobbs of memphis, tn. " it's a struggle each day when i see those people who look nothing like me and then i see myself in the mirror. but then i tell myself that i will not be bullied by the media or anyone else. " " i'm not going to change my lifestyle just to live up to some media ideal of being an appropriate weight for my height or having a healthy body, " dobbs added, pausing a moment to catch his breath. " and by setting a strong example, i hope i'm passing that same message down to my kids. " in addition to confirming that americans were currently standing up in record numbers against media pressure to be thin, the report concluded by noting 	 1

At the same time , only nine per cent of Caribbean tourists failed to take out travel insurance while 11 per cent travelled to Egypt without cover .The survey also showed that it was those in the 18 34 age range who were the least likely to take out travel insurance , with a third saying they had travelled uncovered on their last long haul trip . This compared with a figure of only 6 per cent for those aged 55 and over .India is also one of the destinations where the highest number of Britons has experienced problemsA fifth of holidaymakers to Mauritius will also experience problems during their tripFor those who were insured and went on to make a claim , the biggest single reason was illness that required medical treatment ( 35 per cent ) .Almost as many ( 31 per cent ) needed treatment for accidental injury .Around 20 per cent needed treatment for an injury caused by sports activity , 15 per cent had to be repatriated to the UK because of illness and 15 per cent needed transporting by air ambulance one of the most expensive claim items .Although the average cost overall of a long haul holiday insurance claim was 4 , 859 , the price can escalate for individual destinations .Post Office Travel Insurance said claims data for India revealed that an air ambulance to the UK could cost 80 , 000 to 100 , 000 , while surgery for a broken leg could cost 12 , 000 and treatment for gastro enteritis could be priced between 2 , 000 and 4 , 000 .Post Office head of insurance Paul Havenhand said : ' It is worrying that the countries where holidaymakers are most likely to travel without insurance are also ones where our research found that more problems occurred that might lead to medical treatment or loss of valuable belongings .' If you are planning a winter sun trip to an exotic destination , it is vital to ensure you are comprehensively covered to ensure that you have peace of mind when travelling far away from home . Avoid cheap travel insurance deals that could leave you exposed when problems occur . ' 	 0
Strange reports are beginning to emerge from the palace twenty four hours after the royal bash .A guest , with an insatiable appetite for publicity and a blind ignorance of her own stupidity , broke cover on her facebook page . She reported that the queen appeared " a bit tiddly " and that everyone had been " ordered to keep quiet and threatened with the Tower " if they didn ' t .Apparently , at the end of the bash the queen stood up and , following royal protocol , the guests stood too . This seemed to amused her majesty and she sat down again . Everyone followed suit . She immediately stood up again but staggered slightly and had to sit down again . Again the sheep followed . Members of her family surrounded her with servants hovering closely .More details swiftly followed after the pregnant mother of three " don ' t tell anyone who I am " blog on her own facebook page . The royal doctor was summoned amid conflicting reports that Prince Philip " forcibly held her down in her chair " and " put his hand over her mouth to shut her up . " The queen was eventually led away , surrounded by servants .The guests were then treated to a five minute diatribe by Philip warning of " dire consequences , heads will roll , the official secrets act , treason , the Tower , " before he ran down and the guests were allowed to leave .Another guest reported he overheard the doctor say to Philip : This is your best chance in years mate , get yourself in there , " as he handed Philip some blue tablets . " Bugger that , " Philip is alleged to have replied . " There ' s only one lass worth shagging tonight even if I have to go sloppy seconds after Harry . "This didn ' t go as Philip planned . He barged into the room where Harry was already on the job with Pippa . In his excitement and without his glasses he hit the wrong hole and it was Harry who met Philip . Harry was seen staggering out of the room the next morning muttering to himself , " I think I might really be ginger . I have to see if its as good with someone who ' s alive , " as he hurried slightly bow legged to Prince Edwards room with Philip in hot pursuit clutching a bag of blue pills ." Absolute nonsense . " A palace spokesman quite rightly said . 	 1
Fast food fans still getting over the unpleasant sight of a Taco Bell employee licking a stack of taco shells last week should probably look away now .An image has emerged showing a Wendy ' s server filling his mouth with ice cream directly from the nozzle of a Frosty machine .The photo is just the latest in a series of unpleasant images to go viral showing fast food employees doing things that their employers wouldn ' t approve off .This vulgar image of a Wendy ' s employee eating ice cream direct from the Frosting machine has caused an internet sensation and led to the man losing his jobThe only certainty with this PR disaster is when the fast food chain catches the culprit he will undoubtedly get sacked for doing untold damage to the chain ' s brand .The photograph surfaced on Reddit on Wednesday along with the words : ' I was going to buy a frosty from Wendy ' s until I saw the employee do this ' .The photograph appears to have been taken behind the counter which suggests that the person taking it was also an employee .Wendy ' s hasn ' t released a statement yet but watch this space .Wendy ' s hasn ' t made a statement yet about the photograph but the company is expected to sack any staff involved in the prankTongue lashing : This unnamed employee has lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viralThe incident comes hot on heels of Taco Bell taking decisive action against their now infamous taco licking employee .Fast food fans collectively wretched last week after a shocking photograph appeared on Taco Bell ' s official Facebook page showing a red haired man licking a stack of unfilled shells .The photograph was posted on June 2 by a ' Jj O ' Brien Nolan ' and set off a PR nightmare for the fast food chain .Two days later , in response to a deluge of negative publicity , Taco Bell confirmed that the worker had been identified and fired .' Our franchisee is responsible for the employment and conduct of his restaurant ' s employees and he has informed us that he immediately suspended the employee shown in the photo and is in the process of terminating his employment .' The employee who took the photo no longer works there . 'Initially it was not confirmed whether the photograph was a fake or if the tacos were indeed meant for the trash or were used in food preparation . Taco Bell denied they were .Taco trials : It has emerged that the restaurant where the photograph was taken is in Ridgecrest , California' Our food handling procedures are strict and we have zero tolerance for any violations , ' Taco Bell said in a statement .' The taco shells were used for training in March before we launched a new product , and were in process of being thrown out . 'Despite the risks of being caught , these are only the latest examples of fast food workers getting into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media .In April , a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer .Last year , three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages .And in another shameful Taco Bell image , a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year .' I pissed on them where nobody could see , in private , and I threw them away . There ' s literally nothing they can do . Fire me . I don ' t care , ' Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo .Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately . 	 0

AUSTIN , TX Roberta Asher , 47 , a longtime crusader for environmental and human rights causes , once again humiliated her teenage son Monday when she appeared on the local TV news speaking at a rally for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers ." I ' m sitting in the living room with my friend Josh Marden , when Mom comes in and turns on the news , " said Craig Asher , 16 . " Wouldn ' t you know it , there she is with a bunch of other freaky looking people standing outside the Capitol going on about how Texas is failing to uphold the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act . I swear , I could ' ve died . "Added Craig : " Of all the moms in the world , I get stuck with one who ' s dedicated to eradicating economic and social injustice . "A 1976 graduate of the University of California Berkeley , Asher has spent much of her adult life fighting on behalf of the underprivileged . Over the years , she has taken up such causes as women ' s reproductive rights , the imprisonment of AIM leader Leonard Peltier , No Nukes , and Jerry Brown ' s 1992 presidential run . In 1996 , after receiving a law degree from the University of Texas , she established a non profit foundation in Austin offering free legal counsel to Mexican migrant workers .Michelle Asher , Craig ' s 20 year old sister , said she is " used to her mother ' s activism by now , " but sympathized with her younger sibling ' s feelings of humiliation ." I mean , it ' s fine that she wants to help poor people and stuff , but she does it in , like , this really embarrassing way , " Michelle said . " Couldn ' t she find a way to do her protesting less publicly ? "For the past 18 months , Asher has worked tirelessly to force the state of Texas to more closely monitor farm labor contractors and agricultural employers , demanding that they be required to disclose more information about their treatment of workers ." The MSPA requires farm labor contractors to register with the U . S . Department of Labor , " said Asher , her son cringing nearby . " But there ' s no structure of accountability in place to actually punish them for abuses . There are workers out there being treated no better than slaves because employers know they won ' t seek recourse . "Over the years , Asher has embarrassed her children by appearing on the local evening news , writing impassioned letters to the editor of the local newspaper , speaking at city council meetings and rallies , and even posting signs on the front lawn of their home ." Last week , Mom stuck a big sign in the yard that said , ' Support H . R . 343 ! ' " Craig said . " Thank God none of my friends know it ' s some dumb bill that requires companies to provide contracts in a worker ' s own language or some bullshit like that . "Asher ' s commitment to improving working and living conditions for migrant workers in Texas not only puts her in front of the camera , but occasionally on the front lines , as well ." There was a picture in the paper of Mom at one of her protests , and Mr Gemberling , my social studies teacher , brought it in to class and showed it to everybody as an example of ' someone making a genuine difference in the community , ' " Craig said . " So Doug Fritz yells from the back row , ' Dude , your mom ' s a dork , ' and the entire class cracked up . Why should I have to put up with this ? Can ' t mom wait until I ' m out of high school to do this shit ? "Michelle said she long ago gave up trying to explain to others what her mother does for a living ." Everyone else can say that their parents are bankers or doctors or whatever , " Michelle said . " What are we supposed to say ?

entering his 25th year in charge of arsenal fc, arsene wenger has released a statement that he is still trying to find'the right players'to spend his money on. in a statement released to the press, wenger said : " it is imperative that i find the right players who will fit into my system of playing. i am ready to spend 30 40 million if i find the right player. the fans want someone who is experienced and proven. so we have been looking for the right player, who is also experienced and proven, for about 10 years now but with not much success. we will continue to look for these players because otherwise there is no point in spending money on players without quality. " arsene wenger, it must be noted, has been looking to strengthen his squad since the 2010 11 season that started the downfall of the club. in spite of selling fabregas and nasri for a sum close to 70 million, arsene wenger did not make any purchases that summer which eventually lead to the team finishing a dismal 10th in the league. it should be noted that arsenal are still yet to win a trophy since the fa cup all those years back in 2005. after the 8 2 drubbing at old trafford towards the end of that transfer window, arsene wenger had maintained his intention to spend money only on the'right player.'though he did bid for many quality players in this time, all his bids were in the range of 5 12 million, which does not seem to have worked even once so far. it appears that mr wenger is a very strong willed human being as he continues to believe in that philosophy to this day. ever since cesc fabregas and samir nasri left the club for greener pastures ( read more trophy winning probabilities ), there has been a steady outflux of budding stars in their early twenties heading out to different clubs every year. all of them appeared to have developed the intention and desire to win trophies at some stage in their arsenal career and refused to sign contract extensions, thus forcing wenger to sell them. the list of people who have left the arsenal ranks, since 2010, after spending their teenage years under the tutelage of arsene wenger is pretty impressive. theo walcott, van persie, alex song are among many others who have left the club in the past 10 years. in fact, players like carl jenkinson, jack wilshere, frimpong etc, who were just in their late teens and still learning the nuances of the game then, developed into star players under arsene wenger. they also left the club after they realized themselves that they were star players. in all those years, arsene wenger continued to spend money on young teenage strikers and groomed them to become star forwards. as of july 2020, arsene wenger has signed a total of 58 teenage strikers since that 2010 11 season. 54 of these strikers have now matured into world class strikers and attacking midfielders and have moved on to different clubs and have won many trophies. of the grand total of 4 defenders he had signed in the same period, all of them have left the club. arsene wenger has not signed a single goalkeeper in that same period. wojciech szcz? sny continues to be the first choice goalkeeper today. there have been a few significant consequences due to this continuing phenomenon at arsenal fc. first of all, arsene wenger was awarded a special lifetime achievement award by uefa for " spotting and nurturing young talent and then grooming them to become world class stars. " michel platini ( yes, he is still the uefa president ), the uefa president, had awarded the trophy to wenger in a special ceremony that also felicitated sir alex ferguson with the " manager who has served at a single club so long that nobody remembers when he first started " award. arsene wenger accepted the award declaring his desire to continue running the club exactly the same way in the future too. secondly, arsenal fc has been awarded the title of the best feeder club in the history of club football. this award was constituted by all the teams who have directly benefitted from the continuous supply of world class players coming out of arsenal with a desire to win trophies. a complete list of the teams essentially includes all trophy winning teams in the past 10 years from england, germany, italy, spain and france. it should be noted that some of the arsenal players left the club to join championship clubs, segunda division or serie b clubs in order to win trophies. all have been successful. thirdly, arsene wenger recently declared that, as a result of continued selling over the past decade, his available transfer budget currently stands at about 780 million. as revealed earlier, he has made many bids in the range of 5 12 million for what he considers as quality players, but none of them have 	 1
Los Angeles A police officer in Fullerton , California , whom an attorney accuses of brutality in the death of a homeless man this summer and two arrest cases last year , has been placed on paid leave , a police spokesman announced Friday .Sgt . Andrew Goodrich identified the officer as Kenton Hampton , but he declined to confirm whether Hampton is among six officers involved in the arrest of Kelly Thomas , a 37 year old homeless man who died five days after allegedly being beaten by police this summer . That death is under investigation by the FBI and the Orange County District Attorney ." I can ' t comment as to the type of leave or the reason or the length , " Goodrich said of Hampton being placed on paid leave . In making the announcement Friday , Goodrich declined to state when the leave became effective .Hampton and his attorney couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment Friday .Goodrich confirmed that Hampton was the officer involved in a new allegation of brutality made Friday by Edward Miguel Quinonez , 27 , of Anaheim , California , who is planning to file a lawsuit against Hampton for " slamming " his head against a wall in a June 27 , 2010 , incident . His attorney , Garo Mardirossian , who ' s also the lawyer in the two other alleged brutality cases , announced the plans in a press conference Friday .Fullerton police investigated a police misconduct complaint filed by Quinonez shortly after the arrest , Goodrich said ." That complaint was investigated , and there was a disposition on the complaint , and I can ' t talk about the disposition , " Goodrich said .Quinonez ' s case marked the third case of alleged brutality by the Fullerton police . Those three accusations emerged this summer in the wake of the death of Thomas , a homeless man who was diagnosed as a schizophrenic .Quinonez accused Hampton of assaulting him and falsely accusing him of being drunk in public , said Mardirossian .Coincidentally , Quinonez happened to be one of about 100 witnesses to the police struggle with Thomas and even saw Hampton ' s involvement in that incident , Quinonez said . Quinonez was interviewed by prosecutors investigating the homeless man ' s death , his attorney said .In the 2010 incident , the officer was writing a ticket to a motorist for bouncing his lowrider and displaying its hydraulics as Quinonez happened to be on the sidewalk , waiting outside a bar , Quinonez told reporters Friday .The officer told Quinonez not to interfere with the investigation , and Quinonez then responded : " Get away from me because cops killed my dad , " who was shot to death by Riverside , California , police on September 1 , 2008 , Quinonez said .That remark was apparently interpreted by the officer as " contempt of cops , " Mardirossian said .The Fullerton officer then arrested Quinonez and slammed his head against the wall , Quinonez said .A blood test later showed that Quinonez had no alcohol in his system at the time of the arrest , he and his attorney said . 	 0

i grew up in florida in wartime where the bombs were 7, 691 miles away. my childhood was an afghan american suburban dream punctuated by weekend sleepovers, saturday soccer games, fistfights with racist children of the confederate south and religio nationalist driven demonstrations chanting " down with brezhnev! " " long live islam! " " down with communism! " and " long live afghanistan! " before i even knew what that meant. it is what i was fed growing up, in between southern fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes, cumin scented meat and basmati rice. that's why i've referred to myself as " afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of god. " watch aman mojadidi's ted talknow as an artist in a world that is simultaneously in the process of globalizing and fracturing, the work i do explores what i have come to call the " geography of self, " a concept that revolves around a positioning of oneself in the world not just physically, but emotionally, mentally and, perhaps even for those who believe, spiritually. this position is ambiguous, temporary and very often debated. it is constructed by multiple voices and rendered through a prism of different, sometimes even contradictory, perspectives. the body of work i create combines traditional storylines and postmodern narrative strategies to approach themes such as belonging, identity politics and conflict, as well as the push towards and resistance against modernization. my work travels through mental and physical landscapes. it intentionally blurs and merges the lines between them, as well as those between fact and fiction, documentation and imagination. i looked into corruption in afghanistan through a work called " payback " and impersonated a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street in kabul and stopped cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offered them money and apologized on behalf of the kabul police department. i spent a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like pop star bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich. and where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : " vote for me! i've done jihad, and i'm rich. " ted. com : what i saw in the warwhat i engage in through my art is, in fact, storytelling. but through these stories, there is a clear attempt to disrupt and reinterpret historical narratives, both real and imagined, in order to create an entirely new narrative that challenges the dominating histories'stories that shape our experience and understanding of the world we live in. it's not about activism, but about being engaged with our world and humanity in a way that goes beyond the superficial, instead looking deeper into historical constructions of our present state and the basic principles of human responsibility. art has often been and continues to be considered transcendent. i see this as misguided and, in fact, a way of subverting the powerful voice art can be in global discussions about politics, economics, society, culture, religion and international relations. ted. com : my photographs bear witnessthis is not to say that i think my art provides answers. in fact, it may simply produce more questions. but in asking those questions, history and our role in how it constructs the present can be better understood. by using historical facts, documentation, oral history and imagination, i create forms of resistance against the imposition of certain historical interpretations upon us. it provides a way for us to rethink history, disturb identity, challenge authority, dissect politics, shake up society and understand ourselves. in the end, i hope we learn to question what we know of the past, what we understand of the present and what we can imagine for the future. perhaps this is too ambitious a project perhaps art should simply be aesthetically appealing and keep itself out of the realm of politics, history and self awareness. perhaps this is too arrogant a philosophy, to think that what i have to say about the world and our role in it has any bearing at all on how others should think about their environment and themselves. ted. com : dreams from endangered culturesperhaps this is too futile a goal and art is not enough of an action to be an actual catalyst for change. but this is the burden of creating this kind of work, a burden that perhaps comes from the dualistic life i have lived as an american citizen growing up in the comfort of suburbia while family members in afghanistan fought, died and, yes, killed in their battle against an invading army. knowing these opposing experiences could be simultaneously shared within the collective subconscious of my family drove me towards trying to better understand history, politics, perspectives and the human condition. this is my burden and so i must ask : " what's yours? " the opinions expressed in this 	 0

WASHINGTON , DC After months of aggressive campaigning and with nearly 99 percent of ballots counted , politicians were the big winners in Tuesday ' s midterm election , taking all 435 seats in the House of Representatives , retaining a majority with 100 out of 100 seats in the Senate , and pushing political candidates to victory in each of the 36 gubernatorial races up for grabs .While analysts had been predicting a possible sweep for months , and early exit poll numbers seemed favorable , politicians reportedly exceeded even their own expectations , gaining an impressive 100 percent of the overall national vote ." It ' s a good night to be a politician , " said Todd Akin , an officeholder from Missouri . " The American people have spoken , and they have unanimously declared : ' We want elected officials to lead this nation . ' "Already confident they would have an easy time in the Midwest , a region long known for electing politicians , as well as with poll going Americans in the deep South , politicians also picked up seats in each additional area of the country ." We expected politicians to take Washington , Indiana , Oregon , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , Michigan , North Carolina , Maryland , South Carolina , Georgia , North Dakota , Mississippi , Montana , Vermont , Maine , Kentucky , California , Iowa , Alaska , Connecticut , Florida , Idaho , Louisiana , Alabama , Virginia , Delaware , Wisconsin , and Arkansas , " said Georgetown University political science professor Barbara Steward . " But the fact that voters in the urban areas of Rhode Island and the farmlands of West Virginia , along with every other state , all put politicians into office is quite extraordinary . "" Even in the most hotly contested local races that went down to the wire , politicians still came out on top every time , " she added .This year ' s results are the most unanimous since the last election two years ago , in which politicians enjoyed widespread victories unrivaled since the election before that , and the one in 2000 .Politicians managed to appeal to all economic and ethnic backgrounds , genders , and age groups , enjoying equal success among both liberal voters and conservatives .Issues advanced by politicians dominated not only the Senate and House races , but also all state , district council , county , and town board elections ." It looks like politicians are poised to dominate the political discourse of the country for years to come , " said analyst Maria Lawson of the Free Enterprise Institute , who as long ago as December of 2004 had picked congressmen to once again take over the House of Representatives . " This should allow them to pursue their own political agendas almost unimpeded , sign even more bills into law , and appoint fellow politicians to committee chairmanships , special interest commissions , and other posts of power . "Added Lawson : " While it ' s still too early to tell , after the success of this election , it might not be too long before we see another politician in the White House . "Despite fears that the dozens of campaign finance violations , soft money misappropriations , infidelity charges , hidden drunk driving records , and protracted congressional cover ups leaked just days before the election would hurt their chances , politicians were still elected over non politicians in every single race ." The fact that not a single non politician even ran for office is just further proof that the American people tend to vote for politicians during times of war , " Steward said . " Past data also suggests that the American people tend to vote for politicians during times of peace , as well as , generally speaking , every two years . "Some voters , however , such as Arkansas native Patrick Bunter , who first voted for a politician Harry Truman in 1948 , are calling this latest victory " politics as usual . "" Over the years , I grew disappointed with the job the politicians were doing , yet I kept on voting for them out of loyalty , " Bunter said . " This time around , I swore I ' d go with someone else , but frankly , looking at the ballot , I didn ' t see any other choice . " 	 1
